Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. So you’re advocating that we literally force children to eat food they don’t want to eat? Like drag them to the kitchen it’s served from and hold them down and force it down their throats to make sure everyone is equal? We cook up a lunch. It is available to any student who decides they would like to eat the food provided that day. Whether they also have tuckshop or food from home or not. Any student who comes by. We still have kids go downtown to steal food. It is the school staff who get verbally abused by the students. Not the students getting berated by staff.
2. Most children are already sufficiently provided for, so there isn't going to be some major change. I think you are being overly dramatic. I don't know what so hard about parents that can afford to feed their children doing so, and support being provided for those who can't. I would argue your position makes even less sense, as the more support you provide to those that don't need it. Then you have even less resources left to provide even more targeted support to those that need it.
3. This is why people don't listen to you. When you run out of canned insults, maybe you'll be useful.
4. I'm not leaving, but I'm definitely getting a vasectomy so I'm not beholden to hoping the religious crazies don't do what they always do.
5. You're arguing against points no-one is making, I'd suggest going back and reading what the other person is actually saying.
6. The person who started the personal attacks gets butthurt. We have well and truly reached the limit of your ability in this conversation.
7. It ain't over yet. Berkman could still just hold on and South Brisbane could remain green if the LNP get second (assuming their vote increases from the pre poll) As for why? Combination of being to ambitious and unaware that their previous victories were narrow. Instead of sandbagging, they chose to stretch their resources thin in unwinable seats. Also Adam Brandt's populism doesn't appeal to a lot of the leafy suburbs in maiwar. A repeat of the BCC results really. Also Miles was more progressive than standard labor, so why would a progressive vote green when they could vote for Labor (free lunch, 50c fares, etc) As for Federal greens they should be terrified in Ryan, at this rate its almost certain LNP gain
8. I think the Greens failed on two, maybe three key fronts. First and foremost their state election campaign was very much focused on federal issues. Rent freezes, and capping grocery prices aren't particularly popular policies in inner Brisbane, outside of The Greens 15 - 20% core voters. Moreover the reason Maiwar and South Brisbane flipped to the Greens originally was due to a focus on broadly popular local issues (improving public transport, new schools, free school lunches, urban revitalisation of traffic sewers etc). It was an absurd strategy misstep to focus on broadly unpopular, unrealistic, unimplimentable, economically illiterate federal policies. Secondly, the Greens won their QLD state and Federal Brisbane seats due to middle aged suburbanites and preference flows. I.e. much of Greens support is soft support. If they want to win seats they need to be careful to avoid marginalising centre-left voters by obstructing fairly progressive federal Labor policies, by being overly critical of Labor in general (i.e. the Greens ad calling out a handful of Labor MPs who voted against abortion), and by focusing on divisive (and ultimately unwinnable) issues like Israel/ Palestine, and Rent Freezes. Thirdly, they ceded a lot of bread and butter policy to Labor with 50c public transport fairs, and free school lunches. I believe The Greens would have had a very different result if their focus had been on local issues like a westside bus network expansion to reduce school traffic in Maiwar, a new school on the westside to reduce overcrowding, a green pedestrian corridor from woolongabba to southbank regardless of the stadium outcome, etc.
9. Not a great campaign from the Greens. The election was basically voters punishing Labor for their part in the cost of living crisis, but when the Miles government announced more progressive policy the Greens became redundant and couldn’t get their message out to differentiate. The only Greens policy I heard of was free public transit which seemed unnecessary when Labor had made it basically free. Also think the abortion debate moved other progressives to Labor as a reward for legalisation. Don’t think federal politics had much to do with the state election results but will give Labor some hope of winning back their lost Brisbane seats.
10. ALP: fix the roads LNP: privatise the roads GRN: free palestine
11. ~~Inability~~ unwillingness to compromise. Perfect greens policies being the enemy of labor good policies, and refusal to negotiate or support a meeting at half-way. Federal greens better pay attention.
12. Honestly? They need more actual working class people at all levels of the party. And regional working class. Nearly every single green policy could be used for regional areas in a good way and create support for them but you walk into a meeting in muddy boots and talk like a farm worker or tradie or deckhand and you're socially unwelcome, let alone putting forward issues with policy. I come from primary industry and working class family. There's a way to talk about renewables, protection for the environment, and all that, which will get support from nationals and even one nation. But instead we get theory and some truly unreal takes from people who don't have the experience to talk about it with the workers. Most primary industry do want sustainable practices. Working the land to death and destroying your catch and all that is not something they want. But you have to be able to listen and not respond to racism and misogyny etc*, and hatred of red tape, and all that, in order to get there. You can't launch into a lecture on intersectionality and micro aggressions when doing outreach, or have your trauma moment. Not when you actually fucking agree on the central issue. A big part of that was obvious with the youth crime discourse. Looking at the stats properly makes some shit really clear. It is vastly different between areas - but also that spike up north? Literally the result of less than a dozen recidivist kids. There are ways to discuss this that aren't just "free lunch will solve it" or "racial bias caused this" that do honour the trauma victims go through. While still being cognizant that the data and the research is pretty clear on what works to reduce crime. I'm a traitor to my class in a lot of ways now, what with the education and my career. I can talk theory and I can call out linguistic misogyny, and lateral violence, and I know my studies and how to support my arguments. But that's all fucking *irrelevant* to outreach. It's listening and being able to find common ground. Greens are often bad enough at finding it that I do agree with a lot of their policies, or I'm even more left, and I come out of conversation with supporters or party members hugely disgruntled and aware of how unwelcome me and people like me are. (And don't get me fucking started on disability policies, those tend to be very divided between Greens and lived experience, in a way that's genuinely ableist and ignorant) *The kind old school version, where their Vietnamese mate Hung and those guys are okay, and Sally the captain is a fucking fine woman, but have some slurs while they talk about it and why those people are different to the general category)
13. Green fatigue has well and truly set in.Too many protests and division from that quarter in an era where people want stability.
14. I have a feeling they just got out of touch for alot of voters, putting too much energy in divisive issues and not actually doing anything for the voters in electorates.
15. Greens need to narrow the focus of their messaging. There's absolutely no point wasting media time talking about Gaza or Israel. We don't really actually care when rent is rising and groceries for two adults cost $300/wk now. - clean environment - tax big corporate more tax small business less - help GPs with bulk billing on Medicare so it's more accessible - add dental to Medicare - housing crisis needs addressing and it ain't rent caps. We need to build more. Full stop. - stop immigration ffs, just for a while as we let everything catch up
16. Actually not sure why Berkman is losing Maiwar now, unless they expect a hefty ALP preference flow to go LNP instead of Greens. That's even if you assume 100% of ON goes to LNP. Am I missing something? Last election's ALP preference flow to GRN was ~80%. Berkman is still ahead with that math and 100% ON to LNP.
17. It's obvious to me that the federal Greens have been punished for letting perfection be the enemy of good regarding the cost of living and housing.
18. Ex-green voter. South Brisbane I decided to return to the ALP because to me the Greens are more a party of protest lately. The way they criticise and vote against ALP especially in the federal government is counter intuitive.
19. Turns out being a party of NIMBYs who can't get anything done makes you undesirable. They need to cut out the weirdos like Sri who seems to be happier as a militant than a politician and come up with some genuine policies that don't revolve around fantasy and are actually viable. Yes it would be lovely to tax every big company 100% of their profits and we all get free everything forever and ever and sing Kumbaya on Queen Street but that's not real life.
20. One of the commentators last night made a great point. Gen Z voters have never seen the “Bob Brown protect the wilderness” Greens. They’ve only ever seen the current “say no to everything “ Greens and see that they have no intention to actually drive any change.
21. Their primary vote stayed pretty much the same statewide, so let's not get carried away with the doom and gloom like they've been rejected completely
22. I strongly doubt the greens will lose Maiwar, and I have no idea why the ABC was projecting it - The greens are in second place and Labor preferences will get them the win. South Brisbane is probably a loss - The greens are in 1st place on first preferences this time and last time, and the liberals are in third - last time the liberal how to vote card was telling people to put the greens ahead of labor, because they wanted to unseat jackie trad; this time they've got the greens last, and that's what's making the difference. There is still a slim chance though that the liberals might end up with enough votes to slide into second place, in which case the greens will win based off labor preferences
23. The Greens need to move away from virtue signalling about Palestine and focus on actual issues that impact Australians. Imagine looking at all the botted comments on Reddit and thinking this is the primary issue Australians care about
24. Idk why I already forgot today was the election and I thought this post was going to be a thread with tips on finding cheap veggies. 😭
25. I'm in Mairwar, and there were lots of ads about the Greens being dangerous, crime rates will go up, they support terrorists, etc. Clearly targeting boomer fears, so I wonder if that messaging has shifted the preferencing of Labour voters.
26. Personal thoughts. The polls showed a strong swing to LNP, people who are usually Green voters voted for Labor out of fear of LNP, and a lot of people also fell for the "a vote for the Greens is a wasted vote/vote for LNP" rhetoric because that's what Labor constantly says. And it works apparently because I literally saw a bunch of comments on here saying "I usually vote Greens but I'm so scared LNP will get in I'm gonna vote Labor" and I know Labor people who say this sort of shit constantly too. So misrepresenting the prefential voting system is effective in convincing all the noobs who don't know better to vote for them. Then Labor also came out with a bunch of watered down copy cat Greens policies so people thought "why vote Greens when Labor is basically doing the same thing". Miles also outright said he'd prefer a LNP government than govern with a Greens minority and I think that further fucks things up. Coz people think "oh no, can't have that better vote Labor instead of Greens so they'll definitely get in". Fat lot of good that did. And also, where last election the 2 majors would put the Greens above each other in some seats for preference rank, now they are preferencing each other, so there is no room for minor parties. Anyways that's my thoughts. Despite all my criticisms of Labor I really liked Miles and thought he was doing really well and only just getting started too. So I'm really depressed that Queenslanders love the boot so much The sheer size of Qld works against us politically I think, also let's not forget the Greens are getting squeezed on all sides politically. If theres one thing both Labor and Liberals agree on its that they hate the Greens. So yeah.
27. In Maiwar at least you can see preferences shift to both the LNP and labor. Clearly, Miles did a good job of convincing the electorate that labor in general was worth giving another shot (relative to where he started, at least). The LNP swing takes a bit more unpacking. I think the idea that Berkman himself had the wrong policies is kind of dubious, I doubt anyone even really knew anything about his policies specifically. He's significantly less visible than other QLD Greens. I think there's a problem for the Greens in general that the majority of the things people like about them, they cannot achieve without overwhelming political power - something at odds with their fairly consistent overall vote share. Whether or not you want to blame them for this limitation, it makes it hard for them to sandbag seats and hold onto them. I also think there was a very strange phenomenon in Maiwar about a seemingly large, well-funded and fairly aggressive throng of I'm guessing israel-linked activists who seemed determined to punish the Greens for their stance on Palestine. I had seen the political advertising, but I was really surprised to see how many of them showed up to voting stations for this election, especially considering how tenuous the link to Israel/Palestine politics is for the seat. But I could definitely see that shifting some people.
28. Because being a militant ideologue is not attractive to most people, nor is it practical in a parliamentary democracy. Sri just comes off like a university student politician to me.
29. I feel that the Greens have forgotten their roots, they are currently a bunch of NIMBYs who don’t care about the environment, they don’t talk about protecting the environment, they are unrealistic about urban development, they want the inner city to stay like it is, filled with big houses with yards and to have the planes fly over the poor people’s suburbs because people who can afford to travel shouldn’t have to deal with the noise.
30. I'm not a greens supporter but it would have been good to see the minor parties grab some seats and steal the majority away from our colesworth two party majority. If we want any meaningful change in this country, we need to start voting in our minor parties. Voting in one nation, katter party, the greens, progressive party, etc.. will lead to a true democracy. With no majority government, these parties will need to debate and compromise to lead us to a better future. Much like the inception of democracy in ancient Greece. Debating on issues from many different points of view to come to a meaningful conclusion.
31. Batshit insane policy like capping food prices, capping rents and starting up a bank. Nobody is high enough to believe that's realistic.
32. When your state and national agenda is Palestine and blocking meaningful housing reform this was always bound to happen.
33. Hardly surprising, the greens have lost their way. They focus almost entirely on niche social issues that affect a tiny section of the population and their environmental policies have been made an afterthought. Perhaps if they stopped pandering for sound bites with hard-line policies they know they'll never have to actually make work, they'd have people voting for them. I stopped voting for them about 8 years ago.
34. The Greens get about 10% of the vote and 0-1 seats. Katter’s party gets 3% and 3 seats. So there’s that.
35. Labor pulled away Green votes because they thought that would be a good strategy instead of retaining their own / fighting marginal LNP seats. Greens voters liked that Labor used Greens policies and feared LNP abortion laws etc so swung over to Labor in these seats. I don't really see it as Greens failing. We just had a rare good candidate in Labor for once.
36. What's to blame for this? Lydia Thorpe Seen to be too close to, sympathetic with the radical portions of the Palestine protests, including terrorists flag waving and anti-Semitism. Not denouncing violence, property damage etc that has been occuring during the protests. Green senators or MPs refusing to denounce particular terrorist groups or attacks Obstructionist at a federal level regarding housing supply reform ( especially Max Chandler-mather) Bizarre policies like state owned / nationalised banks Standing with / Protesting with a disgraced union (CFMEU) and protesting against intervention into the corruption and criminal conduct occuring within
37. Perhaps they should stop coming out in support of hamas and hezbollah terrorists.
38. People are over their radical agenda, and stopping traffic on busy roads was the last straw
39. Max is a fucking wanker, and absolutely fouled the greens. I’m not a greens supporter, I was pretty neutral on them - seeing them as sort of the hopeful dreamers that just spit out fanciful ideas and take credit for their realistic implementation, but now… How could you dismiss the HAFF as “just a series of complicated bank accounts”. Absolute moron. “It CosTs mOre THaN ThirtY ThOUSand to buiLd a hOUSe LABOR”. Absolute dregs of the intellectual barrel attempting to masquerade as useful and informed.
40. Focus on retaining the seats they have at federal level, and don't fight Labor on issues that offer an immediate solution. That is the lesson Labor just learnt in NQ. If they want to play politics, the can nominate one of their party members for Speaker of The House and gain some sympathy there.
41. I think the minor parties lost out due to fear of having lnp in. Can't risk losing a labor seat for an lnp one
42. *disclaimer - haven't read this whole thread* The greens are no longer the party that Bob Brown championed. I grew up in West End, and Northern NSW. Am ethically a staunch lefty. I come from unionists, farmers, pro human rights, queer allie, pro harm reduction... you name it. The greens have lost their way. They have decided that 'not good enough' means 'block it and fight it' instead of working towards change from the inside out. Radical policy and soapboxing 'grassroots' movement in a two party system is not productive, and while i admire the fight, they have ultimately isolated themselves by pushing for radical agendas in a very ingrained, colonial Westminster system. Policy change, acceptance, and integration in the lens of community development can take up to 10 years to be implemented, accepted, and seen as a result. You can't force radical change on people in such a privileged country and expect everyone to just jump ship. The fact that this is an issue is the tip of an iceberg. With respect to the ideal - the approach is not inclusive, its not an open conversation, its one or the other and we as a country have it far to good for that to create the right outcome. You can't create change and change engrained views by being noisy in this day and age. You have to be smart. You have to educate gently, and you have to be holistic. I believe they can do better, and i hope they do, but they need to rethink their strategy and consider how to engage a broader audience. Just an opinion. Very dissapointed by the election outcome, but i didn't see it going any other way. These parties need to rethink the approach.
43. Not surprising. The Greens aren't sustainable. That's the irony. Their socialist policies are easily copied by Labor. Their economic policies are a threat to the average punter's super balance and desire to have a bit left over for themselves. Telling nurses and cops, teachers and public servants that there's a freeze on their rent is just out of touch. No matter the social reason, it's politically immature. Their environmental policy is their only differentiation. And that isn't enough to keep voters. The party is dead in the water. And that is a good thing. Why? Because the party hasn't got the experience to run a country, a state or a council. They can throw stones, get loud and oppose. But, when it comes to governing, you need substance, real foundations, wide appeal and policies that have economic advantages for the whole. For the Greens to survive their leaders and members need to leave the city, go and work on farms and truly understand the challenges of the regions. Can't tell people how to live their lives if you haven't walked in their boots and truly listened to their realities. It'll always be the Greens' downfall. Bob Brown learned that the hard way, on a bus. This may be unpopular on this forum of Greens and Labor lovers. The results of tonight are also unpopular.
44. I was at a few booths today in seats that the Greens were targeting. I can't say for certain because I don't know what their volunteers were told to say re: messaging when handing out HTVs. But the message seemed to change from booth to booth - and this wasn't between electorates, but within. One particular booth was consistently "Vote for a progressive change", and another I didn't hear those words uttered whatsoever. The amount of signage they had up as well with a lot of different messaging was really overwhelming. Whilst I believe they needed to focus on making Maiwar and South Brisbane a fortress for future campaigns, the fact they didn't meant they really needed a different type of approach to what they delivered on the ground. Where the Greens have come to prominence has been on the back of backlash towards the major parties. So they needed a simple central theme that really tapped into that. I'm just not sure they actually had that.
45. Be nice if the greens were there for environmental reason, but they're not
46. Imma be real, why the fuck are you asking that in this sub? You’re just going to get people (which you already are) saying greens are bad for being leftists. Especially when you’ll have ALP voters kinda blaming greens voters, and we know for a fact now that a majority of Queenslanders want something antithetical to the greens.
47. Perhaps people cottoned on to the fact that the Greens aren't about the environment at all - the name is a complete misnomer. They should really have been the Reds.
48. Maybe they could get out and do some real direct climate action..
49. Labor moved leftwards and the Greens couldn't differentiate. Also Amy McMahon just had terrible political instincts.
50. I’d say the batshit crazy policies were a significant factor.
51. Max has not represented the area well being anti progress on every thing and anything. He will be gone next federal election as he is all bark and no action. He has not represented the long time residents of the area that want to see change to a more modern livable inner city Gabba such as SE Square. Time for him to look for a job next election.
52. Many people want to back a party that presents a clear, unified message. When climate protests become platforms for various other political issues, it can dilute the urgency of the climate crisis and make it harder for normal ppl to engage fully. The need for cohesion in messaging is crucial for broader appeal, especially when the stakes are as high as they are with climate change. I 100% think we should be fighting for climate action but would never vote Greens as they are too quick to jump on the “next big outrage” rather than focus on long term changes.
53. I don't really have any comments as to the how or why. Just a shame overall to have less voices in parliament other than red and blue. No new independents and just another KAP MP maybe, and they have delved into National Party territory with social issues rather than staying strictly as an agrarian party
54. Lack of strong leadership and no strategy even greens supporters I knew said the party is unrecognisable and didn’t vote for them. Plus a very poor campaign
55. We all know their solution will be to lean further into Gaza and identity politics etc. which the median voter doesn't give a shit about, but will solidify their lefty inner-city base.
