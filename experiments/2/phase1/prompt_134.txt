Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Let's not forget this little gem that's resulted in Crisafulli being referred to the Parliamentary Ethics Committee... Mr Crisafulli was being pursued by the Federal Coalition Government for insolvent trading while he was sole director of SET Solutions. Mr Crisafulli paid $200,000 to stop those legal proceedings in a confidential settlement so Queenslanders didn’t find out. Documents filed to the company regulator reveal the $200,000 was paid to liquidators in three payments between $60,000 and $80,000. Two of those payments were made while he was shadow minister and one while he was Opposition Leader. Mr Crisafulli has not publicly admitted he made those payment or declared the liability on his parliamentary register of interests which at the time had a limit of under $20,000. Public records also show Mr Crisafulli was a Minister in the Newman Government when he funnelled a $320,000 grant to SET Solutions. A year later Mr Crisafulli was sole director of SET Solutions, a position he held for four months. The director that replaced Mr Crisafulli, placed the company into liquidation the following month. The company owed $2.7 million to creditors. The accusation is they were also trading insolvent, which would land you and I in jail or heavily fined. But not Mr Crisafulli.
2. Miles may well not be back. ALP rules cause a leadership spill after any election loss.
3. Cheers, I've also noticed people will blame us, but not ever mention the fact the ALP barely campaigns west of the great dividing range. In my electorate they campaigned in literally two of the towns. How do we expect regional voters to make the right choice when the ONLY campaigning we get to see is LNP and One Nation?
4. I honestly think the only reason, QLD has an LNP Gov today. Is those idiot voters who thought, ALP have been in Gov long enough. The most idiotic way to vote. The LNP will screw up the transition to renewables. Leaving QLD behind the rest of Australia. After the new year. There will be a conscience vote on abortion. Next step will be a coordinated media campaign. Then a members bill on abortion by mid next year. With a vote before the end of 2025.
5. Doesn’t matter where you are or your preferences: if you meet someone saying they think both sides are bad they’re 100% voting conservative.
6. The ALP definitely dropped the ball on rural recovery, and tourism, in the post COVID environment. But that's something to improve rather than baby with the bathwater responses unfortunately.
7. The hand wringing and teeth gnashing really highlights the fact that most of the cunts in this subreddit are either uni students or live in SEQ (or both). I reckon probably more of the former rather than latter given the absolutely embarassing crying over an election loss. Literally like toddlers being told to eat their peas. I live in a semi-rural area and rather than worrying about 50c bus fares, we'd like to have any sort of reliable bus service at all. Oh, and a high school as well would be rather nice. Two things that the ALP have basically told us, not so politely, to get fucked with over the last several years.
8. As someone from Townsville, I find it hilarious that people here think that status quo will change lol
9. >the LNP stole from us Calm down there Donald Trump
10. Anna P and Miles could have not cut Qld Regional health services. They could have upgraded the Bruce to stop the accidents. Labor could have stopped the effort to get rid of rural and regional jobs, with rising taxes, rising power bills and red tape green tape. But they didn't. Labor need to take a long hard look at why so many people voted for anyone but Labor.
11. Another reddit thread whining that some people don't like the outcome of democracy when the result doesn't go their way.
12. I voted for the party that isn’t the one wanting abortions to be banned.
13. "What the LNP stole from us" Are you kidding? They didnt steal a thing...this was a democratic vote. You are entitled to disagree and be disappointed with it. But rhetoric like this is very dangerous when we start talking about legitimate election wins as "stealing" There's a bloke in America who does this....
14. Which puppet are the faceless union fatweights horse trading for next?
15. As an Urban man myself, y’all really are putting in the work over there, their just words but I hope they speak for the people
16. Didnt mind miles, just didnt like the labor representative in my electorate
17. I’m In Mackay and votes labour. It’s amazing that labour has had power here as long as they have given the coal mines etc. I guess the unions are becoming less powerful
18. I always have voted for Labour ever since I turned 18. I’m now 30 going on 31 at the end of the year. Let me tell you something. My mum was one of the many public servants that were sacked because of Newman. She was offered to either move up to Townsville at reduced pay rate. Or take the severance package. Which is always a hard seat to move to labour due to so many conservatives living in this bucket hole of a town. People actually lost their shit when a strip club opened up. A strip club. I just hope to god labour wipes out the LNP in the next election. Do you have any idea what it was like for me to have to watch the uncertainty of my mums future was looking like. I wasn’t even sure if I have to move with her at the time. As my dad & mum were going through a divorce. I wasn’t sure what was going to happen. But we didnt end up moving we stay in Toowoomba. She is doing well now she ended up going into the private sector and worked for a lot of different companies before settling down into local council as a work place health and safety officer. And it was because of her working she meet my step dad who makes her very happy.
19. The LNP win had 2 contributing factors IMO. One, the fear-mongering driven by the Murdoch media. Two, all the cashed up boomers who moved into Qld during or after the Covid lockdowns both here and in NSW and Victoria.
20. Hahaha this echo chamber is the funniest thing. You basement dwellers are so out of touch.
21. Labor is only for rich snobs,mine workers,and civil servants,ie=pompous narcissist
22. Nonsense don't have to vote,that fine just scare tactic always was and will be,just like never was aboriginal land,never was or will be,God's land!!!
23. As someone who has a brother that’s 27 this year who still hasn’t registered to vote. I feel your pain.
24. Don't know about Qld but in NSW, electoral rolls are cross referenced with driving licences. Hope he enjoys his fine.
25. Pretty much everyone I spoke to. As much as I despise LNP and the morons that voted them in, I still stand by the old Family Guy quote. "Undecided voters are the biggest idiots in the country."
26. Or the people that donkey vote to have a little rebellious up yours to the system when In reality too lazy to actually invest a little thought and time into it.
27. We also have a huge number of permanent residents who don’t vote in this country.
28. Miles could've redeveloped the Yeppoon hospital to be on par with the Rocky Base, taking pressure off of both hospitals. But Crisafuckwit absolutely won't, because it conflicts with his 'spend no money, let infrastructure fall into ruin, and call it good economic management' way.
29. Air travel is rarely approved these days as the govt will only pay the equivalent of a train trip. Why shouldn't we get the same health care as the SE corner? We pay the same Medicare levy.
30. I voted for Smiley.. my Barron River electorate flipped to LNP. Still, almost a year after our floods, not one engineering development on the fixing of the captain cook or Kuranda range nor Kuranda bridge. Those chinooks that flew straight past Cape Trib communities realllllly gave me the shits. I do think Smiley ran a Brisbane campaign and not an all of QLD campaign. I’m not too worried.. the LNP will LNP and will be a one term failure. Once the bible thumpers rear up, it’ll all be downhill from there.
31. Miles was pushing for mad public transforms regionally, especially up north and connecting the closer regional places with brisbane
32. Both major factions and Unity have signalled they intend to keep him as opposition leader and have him lead at the next election. It's possible things change between then and now, but I'm kinda doubtful.
33. Said on the radio this morning they want to change the deputy, and keep Miles. But the deputy is known by colleagues to want the premier position for himself so we will see how that goes 🤦
34. To be fair regional Queensland is kind of to blame for that too. Politicians generally speaking tend to not bother campaigning in areas they don't believe they will win. And history shows that regional Queensland has been pretty unsupportive of Labor, both at state and federal level.
35. Yep. I met one in the wild. I was shocked. What kind of argument is that???
36. Why when the lnp finally last week said there will not be any change to the legislation regulating abortions during their first term would they turn around and shoot themselves in the foot by doing what you describe?
37. Post COVID does have an element of correction to it. A lot don't see it.
38. I no longer live in NQ. Why do you think the ALP lost so badly? Is it really about juvenile crime, or because of the royalties being increased?
39. I'm referring to mining royalties, compulsory preferential voting and reproductive rights, not the election itself.
40. Nooo. We can't possibly look inward for the answers. It has to be Murdoch and low IQ hicks in the regional seats.
41. Not liking it and whining is perfectly allowed and perfectly fine. Not liking it and crying foul and / or storming a capital city would be problematic. But I don’t see left leaning voters doing that. It’s usually more of a conservative thing.
42. Agree 100%. All of the people posting "well, all you idiots who voted brainlessly are gonna reap what you sowed..." - it's just coming across as a bunch of whiners having a tantrum. I vote left. We didn't win. Sometimes, that happens. Whinging won't change it, nor will calling people who didn't vote your way names. Some people didn't vote conservative because they're brainless idiots - they actually support conservative politics. Deal with it. Labor were in power too long, and until Miles got the job and actually did some good stuff, they genuinely looked tired and like they needed to go. You can complain all you want that the LNP offered nothing, but obviously, time for a change + the true believer vote is enough to carry an election. Better to acknowledge that, save your energy and stop alienating people who might be persuaded to change their vote in the future.
43. I meant good policies that the LNP said they'd get rid of like 50c PT, easy access to safe abortion, and mining royalties. Not the election itself.
44. Not election fraud... but it does feel like LNP are going to toss the good policies that labor was working for along with mining royalties.
45. He's not referring to the election being stolen. He's referring to what the LNP will steal from Queensland over the next four years...
46. They are stealing the coal royalties that were rightfully ours and giving them back to the coal companies.
47. Don’t worry the drought will be broken by the shedding of labor tears.
48. So your mum got a payout, got a better job, and met her new husband because of Campbell Newman? What a guy, maybe you should send him a Xmas card 😃
49. Got a decade of snark to get outta your system now that the LNP finally get their one term aye? Don't worry we'll be back to another 15 years of Labor after this so enjoy it while you can :)
50. Most accurate thing I’ve read all day. Politics and policies aside does it not strike anyone that only one that one side seems to be making all the noise here and on other subs today. I’ve looked for constructive conversations here and other qld subs and they just don’t exist. You’d swear the state didn’t vote yesterday.
51. Does he know he’s not allowed to not be registered?
52. I wasn’t registered till I was 42. Never got fined.
53. Advocating for non citizens to vote would win the LNP/Liberals every election until the people agitating for it jogged on. Either side agitating for the rules to change because it would generate better outcomes for their side would generate significant, & deserved, backlash.
54. What do you mean? I have known people to not be registered and as such, not vote. I've also known people who will agree with labor type policies but then show such a lack of interest in politics that they either don't cared to inform themselves or tell me they don't understand politics.
55. Mate, a disturbing number of people think exactly that way, they're almost as bad as the "I just vote how my patents do" crowd.
56. Oh there will be a Hospital development up there....just a Healthscope/Ramsay private hospital. That's the Lib way lol. I think Palaszczuk should have stood down earlier and given Miles longer to cook. He clearly cares about everyone in the state but didn't have enough time to get up and properly make a dint. Especially out rural where people are dug in with their views. I'm a diehard labor but I'd happily change my vote when I saw good change occurring. Additionally, it's a failure on all the labor members up north that haven't done a thing in the last 8 years either, where were they when parliament was half empty during sittings asking for this stuff.
57. >Miles could've redeveloped the Yeppoon hospital to be on par with the Rocky Base, taking pressure off of both hospitals. Having two hospitals with similar service levels that close together serving a population of ~200k would be incredibly inefficient. Gold Coast has three times the population, but Robina and GCUH don't have the same facilities.
58. Is it reasonable that you receive the same health care if transport costs are 100x more? Overall the resources required to deliver the same level of care to someone living remotely, or even in a moderately rural area, will be far greater.
59. Not campaigning in places you expect to lose is a cyclical self fullfilling prophecy. I'm not saying they should have thrown a lot at my electorate, but doing nothing is a guaranteed loss that will further alienate regional populations from the Labor party.
60. Labor screwed up so badly they've lost Mackay and Rockhampton, two seats they've held for 100 years. They didn't campaign in those seats because they didn't think they could lose those seats. The absolute arrogance and the dismissive attitude of Labor towards regional issues has rightly cost them across the regions, including in their heartland.
61. Labor was created in Regional Qld and historically, the regional cities have had strong Labor bases due to the working class population. I think the current swing originates from a more recent event, the cooker exodus.
62. If they weren't gonna touch the abortions laws, the LNP would have ruled out a conscience vote.
63. There is a conservative push at State and Federal levels of the LNP. To make reproductive rights a hot button issue for the next Federal Election. QLD was the test balloon for this. Why would it matter if they 'shoot themselves in the foot' now. The LNP will form a majority Gov. They're in power now. They won. In 2018 Crisafulli voted against legalising abortion He will have a conscience vote on abortion. Not only is there support in his own party. The election results clearly indicate. Some QLDers feel its the States place, to dictate what a woman does with her body. The youth crime bullshit was a smoke screen. Statistics prove their spin doctoring on youth crime was bullshit. It will happen. A member will introduce a bill, after the conscience vote; maybe 6 months after. During that time, you'll have media segments and newspaper articles, polls circulating which indicate community support. Then, legislation comes before the house. Probably late next year, perhaps 2026. In which a woman right to abortion will be **significantly** limited. It won't be on a medical basis but a religious one. Because that's the only argument against, legal/safe/medical monitored abortion, religion. There is absolutely no other reason, for this to be a topic for political debate. Its a medical issue, not a political issue. Between a doctor, a woman or couple. Not between an elected official and strangers.
64. They weren't SEEKING to change it... But if it falls into their laps via Katter...
65. Townsvillian here. It's got nothing to do with royalties and everything to do with crime and our 3 MP's who have quite frankly, been pathetic. The people here are so fed up with the crime and our cries falling on deaf ears. It doesn't help that southerners try to gaslight us by telling us it's a non issue and we only think it's an issue because of sky news or whatever. Seriously, go fk yourselves. You have no idea. We don't care about your state wide stats. Our lived experience is all that matters and our eyes are not deceiving us. And no, it's not a post Covid phenomenon. It's been getting worse since well before then. We are a Labor town and we'd probably prefer to vote Labor, but desperate times call for desperate measures. If LNP cannot do anything about the crime issue, then they'll be turfed out at the next election. Then ALP will get their chance again. Hopefully the message will get through. If you want your cushy job representing us, then you best fight tooth n nail for us about our #1 issue, or your job isn't safe. Instead of blaming regional areas for voting against Labor, maybe start placing some of the blame on the Labor MP's in these areas for their failings.
66. What policies have they announced about mining royalties or abortion (euphemistically referred to as "reproductive rights" lol)? What's your association with Labor? You realise how badly they fucked up to lose CQ after 100 years right?
67. Agreed. Though the biggest disappointment in my mind is that the coal miners somehow managed to convince regional areas that the LNP would solve the perceived issues which Labor were yet to address. You and I both know that's not going to happen, because the LNP are ideologically opposed to Government providing services to the people that could otherwise be offered by the private sector. They favour a user-pays society. It's for this reason regional LNP voters have demonstrated their lack of critical thinking - OP mentioned the Yeppoon Hospital should have been provided with additional funding and resources to avoid locals having to go to Rockhampton, but if it isn't viable for the government to prioritise what makes them think private enterprise would consider it a profitable endeavour? The only way LNP even statistically show improvement in health delivery is by making it so expensive that only the wealthy can obtain care. Frees up a lot of beds if the plebeians can't afford to be admitted to hospital in the first place!
68. Like to hear u say that when we also get Dutton and co as majority federal party...
69. How tf does 50c transport benefit you in North Queensland?
70. Alright I’m a ALP member, and vote greens but no. (And you can check my post history on that if you don’t believe it) LNP has agreed to the 50c public transport remaining for this election cycle. After the coal royalties protection ACT LNP also agreed to maintain the royalties this election cycle. And I reckon the absolute dumpster fire of a drop in votes on the day vs the early pre poll days, that can be attributed to the abortion issue, LNP will be blissfully aware that Abortion for them would be an election killer, they lost their landslide victory to abortion (pre poll vs on the day votes would of had Labor easily lose more than double what they’re looking to lose)
71. They aren’t married just dating. I just call him my step dad cause it’s just easier. The companies that she worked for before working for the local Councils went out of business in their civil side of their businesses and went full time into their construction side of their business. She worked for Main Roads when Newman came into office it was either move or take a redundancy payment. That’s she was offered. I’m not sure if her other co workers were offered the same thing either. It’s a possibility I don’t actually know since it’s been so long now. But she didn’t end up with great bosses either. While working for some of the local councils. They treated her like shit and quit started looking for other jobs elsewhere.
72. >So your mum got a payout, got a better job, and met her new husband because of Campbell Newman? I was thinking the same exact thing, lol.
73. It’s extremely disappointing that these people simply don’t have the maturity to have constructive conversations
74. Weren't LNP arguing for changing the electoral system to optional preferential?
75. 100% This. Palaszczuk lost this election, not Steve. Palaszczuk let her ego run away and stayed in 1 term too long. She was a lauded as a state hero during covid. Should have gone out on a high and let Miles rebuild.
76. Never thought I’d see not one but both of my employers mentioned here.
77. Its always the people who need it most that vote for the people who help the least
78. Well firstly, Rockhampton Base also serves out in the central west, if they get sick or injured there and the local medical centres can't fix it, off to Rocky they go. Secondly, Yeppoon has exploded since Covid, and hasn't slowed down, so there's no harm in future proofing. Even if Yeppoon hospital were only half the size of Rocky Base, it would still be better than the glorified school sick bay it is now.
79. It’s not inefficient if your goal is to get people out of the SE corner which is what we need to do. It’s also not inefficient for the people in those areas.
80. Yea and our hospitals fucking suck ass. 24 hour wait times are NORMAL. Just to be fawned off and told nothing is wrong with u even if ur missing a leg and have a third eye that's grown... 'oh ur GP will sort a treatment plan with you'... Most of the time only one Dr on duty too... Don't be like us. 2 similar hospitals serving cross regions would handle patient loads wayyyy better than diversifying that shit and splitting the hospital focuses. We need more functioning hospitals periods.
81. SEQ blueprint doesn't work here. You can't compare Goldcoast and Robina to central Qld/cap coast. This line of thought is exactly why regional health services are cooked. Everyone who can make decisions doesn't step outside brisbane. It would relieve significant pressure and prepare for ongoing growth.
82. Yes it is reasonable when the alternative is blindness. Transport cost 100 times more. Please show me the link. What is your eyesight worth?
83. Yes. It's literally a principle of healthcare delivery in this country.
84. It is generally just a resource issue. Sure if you have unlimited resources then you should campaign everywhere. But if you have limited resources then you need to allocate them to seats that are marginal, either because you might lose them or you think you could win them. Many regional QLD seats are not even close to marginal, and if they are it is between Katter and the LNP or One Nation and the LNP.
85. Cost of living and the uncontrollable narrative around youth crime by pro LNP media defeated Labor. Despite youth crime being down, and despite the cost of living largely being out of the control of the government. Except for the housing crisis of which both the LNP and Labor are culpable. The ball is in Crisafulli's court now, I for one am interested in how he's going to pay for all his promises despite wanting get rid of the tax that will pay for them... QLD essentially voted to give tax cuts to billionaires and to put children in adult jails which won't solve the crime issues anyway.
86. As an lnp supporter I would be disappointed if they could not see at least 5 other more broadly important and relevant issues to focus on. So we may both be in for some potential disappointment.
