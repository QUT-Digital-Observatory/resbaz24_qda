Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Stayed there many times over the years working for 3 different mines. In the towns peak it had over 1500 people living there. Had everything you could need. Sure not everything but definitely enough. The reason it’s the way it is now in thanks to Qcoal and Glencores hatred for each other. We make a sacrifice to work in these places and still be able to live comfortably in our preferred areas. If your complaint is about the fact you have to travel, maybe work in a different industry.
2. Or maybe move to a nice town that’s closer, Oh wait…
3. How about we nationalise the mines and send all profit to be used to better the lives of qlders
4. There are already alternatives being developed like Hydrogen with Commercial plants being developed as we speak as Trial plants have already proven themselves. No need for coal and gas quicker we can remove it the better as it only makes the climate worse.
5. Heaps of places are screaming for labour so I’m sure they won’t be out of work for long and the coal isn’t worth enough per tonne to charge the royalties right now
6. That they'd have to figure out, they've got a decade or two to do so before they are phased out completely.
7. He's already been told. In other threads. Links and all. He completely ignored it which means his arguments are nothing but bad faith and a self interest. Oh the coal companies lost money... The horror.
8. Still assuming I mentioned food generating power? Just stop. You're making yourself look worse. Just admit you voted for the LNP and it'll explain everything.
9. So you can understand then that the removal of mining royalties is a benefit to the minority (the 1%) to the detriment of the general public. The mining industry would not fold over having to pay a royalty that's complete bullshit tbh - you keep putting this forward like mining companies don't know how to make money or something. They aren't keeping me afloat. I live in Victoria we're fucked.
10. On the plus side, it killed Howard's prime ministership too.
11. Allegedly, although you’d think the mining company that originally built it and then abandoned it and is building a camp half an hour down the road would be tasked with that job.
12. You know the Newlands mine shut in 2023 not 2015……
13. The previous hot/cold cycles are understood to align with the hot/cold cycles the sun goes through. The sun is currently in a cold cycle while earth's temperature is increasing. This is out of alignment and the reason why is well understood: human caused climate change.
14. I’m not getting what you’re saying? In one comment you’re screaming about Glenden being saved without realising it’s a company town that’s nigh impossible to move to if you have family or any sort of special needs. The next closest is all 2-3 hours away minimum. If people are working 12 hour shifts doing physical labour in harsh conditions, adding 40 minutes drive to and from can cause serious fatigue for the workers and increase the risk of an incident. Plus that stretch of road is littered with Roos.
15. Careful, you’re being too reasonable and apparently the majority of the state can’t stand that.
16. 100%, why did we even sell the Queensland rail coal rail network to Aurizon ? If we had some backbone we could have paid off all our mines rail and ports just in the last couple years with the high prices.
17. governments cant reliably manage anything for profit. It would probably start losing money.
18. Why don't we nationalise all free enterprise and regulate the price on everything, comrade? We could change our flag and wear nifty uniforms too!
19. Not high grades of structural steel though. Or efficient enough to replace the 1BT China produces in blast furnaces.
20. Please name a supposed lie I have told ? You have yet to name a single one
21. Um, I'm pretty certain it was due to the flood of people coming here from NSW and Vic which pushed our market into overdrive. Kinda hard to blame a single state govt for that problem.
22. Because cashed up Victorians and NSWers are moving here to take advantage of relatively lower housing prices after selling their properties down south for stupid amounts of money. This has inflated the cost of houses and thus rent. Being wealthier they also trend towards voting for the LNP. There are electorates that increased in population by 15% since the last election and almost all of that growth was southerners.
23. Are you a Queenslander, yes or no? Btw “gum clapping”, mate my gums **can’t** clap, because I have fucking teeth.
24. I vaguely remember something about bringing in rules that mining companies in general would have to treat local towns better. Maybe it fell under this while someone how the other one got around it?
25. Yep. So I fail to understand why qcoal refuses to support a local town? Newlands did it for 30-40 years. Edit: and has been aware since its original approval back in 2015 that it would need too. As highlighted in its 2019 shareholders address
26. Newlands managed to be fine with all those issues you’ve mentioned for over 40 years, and it’s further.
27. Absolutely! We love so much money to private international firms that should be going straight to our state and its people. Just another reason why we need a planned economy
28. That's a bit of a misnomer. Governments which are looking to privatise services and strip away the public's interests cannot run anything for profit. A government looking to develop their nation in the public interest absolutely can. The distinction between public and private is about where the benefits go. Both are run by people and both can be run on a profit
29. Ah how classical, Misrepresenting the article. They are talking about Hydrogen overall not Green steel champion I suggest you learn to read the article before commenting. There are many projects currently occurring in Europe like this[ one as an example](https://hydrogeneurope.eu/eu-approves-e265m-for-swedens-h2-green-steel-plant/) or more Locally [Fortescue Christmas creek](https://research.csiro.au/hyresource/christmas-creek-green-iron-trial-commercial-plant/)
30. You completely refuse to take into account forecasts. You will not focus on anything but the price it was 10 years ago. It's never getting back there and never should.
31. Newlands also had specific fatigue policies in place in regards to shifts. If the new mine can have policies in place to manage those, it would be best. But also, my point stands about Glenden. I think next time definitely do a bit more research if you haven’t been to the area. It’s not just as simple as “move” unless you’re a single bloke that’s young.
32. If it’s viable they will do it. Obviously it’s not.
33. What are you talking about ? The coal price was the highest it’s ever been 2 years ago a lot higher than it was 10 years ago. Forecasts all show the coal price going lower going forward. Here are the references again in case you didn’t read them. [historical coal price](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/coal) [coal price forecast](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/opendata/coal-market-developments--falling-prices-amid-record-high-output)
34. So the local LNP state member, local council and labor government want the town to remain. So what’s the problem? Here is another article https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-07-15/central-queensland-coal-town-residents-fear-closure-mining-compa/102564472
35. I think you point does stand. Glenden currently is a shithole. But it only a hole because the 2 main local mining companies decided it should be. So why can’t Qcoal adopt (with less time traveled because it’s closer) the Newlands system? Because it would cost it money. Can’t have that now can we. I think if every company in the mines was allowed to do what Qcoal and Glencore have, imagine the effect it would have in NSW and Vic.
36. Thanks for your misconceptions and your inability to provide any sources or documented facts to support your claim. Yet it can produce all grades of steel as much as your fossil fuel shilling opinion disapproves of it. Green steel is happening and it will quite rapidly remove coal from being required which will be brilliant as it means one less highly damaging fossil fuel being utilized, Gas should be next.
37. Yeah look I think your beef is more with multinationals bailing out of QLD leaving towns like Glenden stranded than the smaller mines like Qcoal coming in being expected to take on the multinational’s liabilities
38. So how would you fix it? Would the government subsidise the town and pay for grocery stores to arrive? Pay for doctors? This still doesn’t help as families need jobs in the town and you can’t fake a whole economy on taxpayers dollars. QCoal didn’t want it as they wanted to utilise their camp that was built. It would also allow more work to be done during the days as the fatigue policy wouldn’t have been as extreme for the workers. I can’t comment on the other states as I haven’t worked in them
39. Not economically viable champion. One day along with fusion power. Looking forward to both who wouldn’t. [coking coal and green steel (ABC)](https://amp.abc.net.au/article/100828346)
40. Exactly how every other town was built? I’m not going to do a step by step, but if you build it, they will come. Everything is already there. I don’t believe a mining company should be allowed to enforce a “fifo/dido” only policy first should start by deny them from expanding their camp. They already have houses in Glenden, a transition to allow workers to move (if they want too) or put local jobs before fifo/dido jobs when hiring or offer bonuses and insensitive. I don’t agree with closing the camp as every mine relies on a portion of fifo/dido workers. I’m going to finish with a question as I’m leaving this thread. What would you say to the current locals if they bulldozed the town? People still live and own there.
41. It looks like you shared an AMP link.

42. Sure thing champion, If it was economically viable there wouldn't be commercial plants being developed as we speak alongside having trial plants already built. you are pathetic with your shilling for Fossil fuel companies.
43. Yes but the original premise of your post of “how coal companies have reacted to the LNP” is a bit misleading isn’t it when it’s over an accomodation issue isn’t it ?
44. You’ve missed the point. There are no locals. The town is comprised of a few DIDO workers to run the camp and “town” and the very few “local” people are just seeing Newlands through the mine closing. My final word to you is, you have absolutely no idea how it works, don’t just google a town nearby and say “move there!”
45. Looking forward to it champion. Just calm down a bit don’t work yourself up so much.
46. Their post is a direct reaction of the election? A site that doesn’t have a good track record at the moment. Unsure why you are defending it so heavily
47. Direct reaction of a single coal company. Glencore, BMA, Anglo and Rio has allready left QLD coal and the rest are trying to leave but we are focusing all our attention on smaller miners. These towns are going to die and we will blame the smaller miners with no prospect or capability of rehabilitation or transition. We are duping ourselves letting the majors slink out of QLD.
48. I think if you let one mining company get away with it, they all do. I also will never defend a mining company. Whenever given the chance they should ALWAYS support local jobs above all else. I also don’t think Coal is going anywhere in Queensland for a while. BMA and Glencore still own mines (10 between them) and there are still major mines starting with Whitehaven happily starting Winchester south and Fitzroys Ironbark mines to name a few.
49. I don’t disagree they made an absolute fortune over the last couple of years. But BMA has sold 4 mines in the last 3 years. 2 of these to Whitehaven trying to get into met coal away from their thermal assets in NSW. Ironbark is just an extension of Carborough Downs which was sold by the mining giant Vale. New small mines start and stop the amount of coal pumping through QLD hasn’t expanded at all for over a decade now. The big boys are definitely running from QLD but we should make sure they don’t just drop the communities they’re leaving as your post shows the little guys can’t/wont pick up the slack.
50. Honestly this just highlights to me that small operations are absolutely more profitable when compared to the big names.
51. Not usually, usually they have to mine lower quality seams and their cost to mine is a lot higher for example Bowen Coking Coal currently still losing money on every tonne of coal they sell.
52. I wouldn’t consider BCC a good example. They have had some pretty large operating costs to deal with that most small operators haven’t had buying a mine that was mothballed rather then buying a mine that was already operating. More of an example of the issues with running a mine on a budget.
53. Look at Kestrel, Purchased from Rio Tinto back in 2018. More than double production over the coming years. We can’t get exact numbers being privately owned but was awarded mine of the year in 2022.
54. Olive downs is the only new brand new mine to start though and they seem to think they will be the last brand new mine to ever start in QLD. [olive downs](https://www.pembrokeresources.com.au/pembroke-news/olive-downs-could-be-the-last-ever-queensland-coal-mine-to-open/) Smaller miners are just happy to make smaller margins than the big players mining lower quality seams.
55. Yeah great production but their margins aren’t as good as what Rio would accept.
56. At the end of the day, I will stand firmly by the opinion that Qcoal CAN afford the extra cost of housing local workers in Glenden and that they are absolutely trying to avoid it. That their campaign is targeted and unwarranted and this post they made Gloating about the fact is just disgraceful at best and disrespectful at worst. this is my last comment as it’s bedtime
57. Wow, there's enough gaslight in this article to light my home the next time the infrastructure fails. Just one example: "Reducing the number of victims of crime relative to population growth over the next four years is a benchmark upon which the new premier has hung his hat." What actually happened was he promised to resign if victim numbers didn't go down, then a few days later he switched to per capita. Per capita crime has been going down for decades in QLD, so he changed his promise so that it happens regardless of his policies. The reason I call this gaslight is that the ABC is leaving out all of the context and just hoping they can make you forget what he actually promised.
58. So given that they were sworn in yesterday they have 6 days to do all of the following: * INSTRUCT the Department of Justice and Attorney-General to commence drafting the Making Queensland Safer Laws * MEET with the Police Commissioner to outline additional support needed to address the Youth Crime Crisis * SCRAP Labor’s Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro, a project that will push up power prices for families and businesses * HOLD our first LNP Cabinet meeting * ESTABLISH the Cabinet Housing Ministerial Taskforce * INSTRUCT Treasury to begin axing Labor’s Patients’ Tax * INSTRUCT Treasury to begin abolishing Stamp Duty on new builds for first home buyers * BEGIN the review of Labor’s DNA Lab Debacle to deliver justice for victims * START implementing The Right Plan for Queensland’s Future across each portfolio by tasking Ministers with Charter Letters The first cabinet meeting and tasking ministers with charter letter won't be hard given that there is only two of them: [https://cabinet.qld.gov.au/ministers-portfolios.aspx](https://cabinet.qld.gov.au/ministers-portfolios.aspx) At least a few of them will be impossible to do because there is nothing to do.
59. Adult crime adult time means there are no youths to commit crime. Genius.
60. Yet no indication of where the funding is coming from?
61. Housing: >The key policy on housing is abolishing stamp duty for all first home buyers in Queensland. Excellent way to increase the buying power of buyers, so that sellers can increase their selling prices and capture what would have gone to stamp duty. Simply drives demand on an existing inventory of homes. Disastrous approach. >A shared equity scheme will initially be open to 1,000 people who have a minimum 2 per cent deposit, i.e. a relative handful of lucky lottery winners will be able to get into a house. While the millions of others who want to buy just keep seeing housing prices keep going up. The LNP policy approach to housing will only make everything worse. Thanks QLD voters for making sure millions of Queenslanders will be priced out of housing and end up entrenching generational inequality.
62. lol, this just reminds me of The Office when Michael is at the shareholders meeting and starts bullshitting about a 40 day plan
63. >Mr Crisafulli has vowed to stop budget blowouts on public infrastructure as a cost-of-living measure But Davey, investing in public infrastructure is a cost of living measure. Read some Keynes you neoliberal douche
64. How exciting!! Nice to have a government actually doing something. Particularly funny his plan is addressing a lot of the concerns his critics on here had. Here here David, Godspeed making Queenslanders feel safe.
65. It would be funny if crime shoots way up on a per capita level just because the LNP gets in lmao
66. I just think like what government actually wants more victims? As if Labor was purposely trying to increase the number of victims and not doing everything it could to reduce it. No government is actually soft on crime, they just use different approaches to solving the problem.
67. So you’re actually reporting what should be the proper story here. Lmao This is ridiculous. Thank you for this insight
68. Crime rates in the regions has not been going down.
69. Oh they're still lying about "Labors Patient Tax"? I thought they don't like scare campaigns? This was an issue where both parties had identical positions.
70. There is a couple there that will make sure they are wiped out at next election already, It seems they are on a roll of making sure QLD knows why we don't support the Corrupt bandits again. Scrapping the Pioneer-burdekin pumped hydro project is one of the stupidest things they can do.
71. Please explain this 'patient tax'. How expensive/complicated will it be to dismantle it? How come I never heard about it until the LNP propaganda landed in my snailmail? How come the LNP candidate's paid phone jockey couldn't tell me any facts about it either? How come all he had was LNP fear mongering scare tactics? Could it be this 'patient tax' is a figment of an abusive LNP imagination?
72. Two of these require a meeting. The rest involve sending an email. Easily achievable in a week.
73. These guys are hitting the ground running. Great to see our elected officials being productive straight off the bat. Keep up the good work!
74. Oooh I know the answer to this one at least for 50 cent fares. Before: Paid for by mining companies. Now: Paid for out of the general tax revenues, i.e. you and me.
75. I think this policy will end up being pretty neutral overall. Other policy on housing will be much more influential. I thought the abolition of stamp duty for first home buyers only applied to new properties, which should leave existing supply unaffected. For existing properties the thresholds will be adjusted, but that's pretty understandable too. The reality is that first home buyers are not really driving up property prices at all, as their activity in the market is pretty limited. Allowing first home buyers access to their superannuation (federal Coalition policy) would be disastrous though - would heavily favour wealthier young people and be incredibly inequitable.
76. The shared equity scheme is something that Labor NSW implemented last year though as a similar pilot? Saying it's evil because Liberals are proposing it is crazy.
77. Want to feel safe? Turn off sky news and stop reading the courier mail. There you go ‐ you will feel much safer now.
78. The previous government, as with most governments, did a lot too. Can only really think of a handful of governments who were incredibly ineffective at implementing policy - one was the Morrison federal government who were just hopeless at getting crossbenchers onside to support legislation. The Newman Government were also incredibly ineffective despite their massive majority. They talked endlessly about what they were going to do but repeatedly failed on implementation. The jury is totally out at the moment on the new government but they're two days old so that's absolutely okay.
79. What is it with conservatives always needing their feelings pandered to? The right needs to toughen up.
80. I can't wait until you find out politicians can lie
81. Not impossible, there's a lot of cost of living relief that's bound to be scrapped, housing and rent prices are bound to rise without any risk of accountability, and things will inevitably just be worse for struggling people. If I put my tin foil hat on, fuel prices rose by 50c the day after the election. Is that due to the threat of a state based competitor being written off? Who's to say?
82. Crime will go down if the LNP makes positive steps on cost of living, homelessness, health and education crisis we are also facing.
83. Fun fact: Shoplifting Colesworth, scrapping Ebikes and Escooters (rental ones from Lime and Beam), spraypainting freight trains, and things like that, are all victimless crimes!
84. Explain how if violent recidivist criminals are put in jail for extended periods instead of given a stern talking to and set free is 'crime going to shoot up' and why is an increase in violent crime funny to you?
85. And they probably won’t under the LNP - Crisafulli has set has his KPI to per capita youth crime, which as the previous poster has already pointed out, is already going down
86. It can keep going up in the regions and per capita will keep going down.
87. And now the LNP have said they don't care. They only care about the very stats they said Labor was bad for paying attention to. Good one LNP!
88. Yeah, I thought he was running on a platform if "hope, not fear"?
89. They literally just won swing voters over in this region and are now scrapping infrastructure that would benefit the region. That's dumb.
90. I think it’s a bit early to say they’ll be wiped out by the next election... This election just showed us how many people vote LNP without really questioning how that party’s policies line up with their own interests. Elections are emotional, and sometimes it takes things getting worse before people see the impacts of certain policies. Hopefully, by the next election, more voters will be looking at what actually affects their lives and communities rather than just sticking to the same habits.
91. Doesn't matter if scrapping the PB pumped hydro is stupid or smart. My completely unscientific and anecdotal gossip fueled survey of people in that region tells me they don't want it. If that's true, they'll keep the votes. On that issue anyway.
92. Not really, they were elected on these promises, what makes you think those who voted for them will turn if they keep said promise?
93. Says you. Mackay has voted to get rid of it. Pumped hydro is the biggest waste of money. It is sooo expensive and only have a 40% at best availability.
94. It’s a figment of imagination. NSW implemented a tax and Labor asked QLD doctors to basically self report to see whether there was any consideration down the track for it but in the last two sittings of parliament before the election both sides of parliament agreed to not go ahead with it, but the LNP ran with it once the AMA called for both sides of politics to consider abolishing it. Was never on the agenda.
95. Essentially in 2021 there was a review to the payment of Payroll Tax under law, and it was found GP clinics had been failing pay it as they should have been. [https://blog.agredshaw.com.au/new-qld-payroll-tax-ruling-released-for-medical-practice](https://blog.agredshaw.com.au/new-qld-payroll-tax-ruling-released-for-medical-practice) An amnesty period was created up to 2025 to allow for GP clinics to comply with tax law [https://qro.qld.gov.au/payroll-tax/liability/contractor-payments/amnesty/](https://qro.qld.gov.au/payroll-tax/liability/contractor-payments/amnesty/) Both parties commited that GP's wouldn't payroll tax. Labor by providing an exemption, and the LNP by overturning the original ruling. [https://www.ama.com.au/qld/news/Payroll\_tax\_decision\_win\_for\_patients](https://www.ama.com.au/qld/news/Payroll_tax_decision_win_for_patients) And it's also important to note that GP clinics in most other states pay payroll tax as they're legally obligated too.
96. Well you can't abolish a tax that doesn't exist for starters.
97. Do you work in their office? If not, how would you know?
98. Really tells you all you need to know right now concerning how people are forming their opinions.
