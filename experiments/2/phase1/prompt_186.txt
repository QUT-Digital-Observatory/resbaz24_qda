Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Sky News, channel 7 news, channel 9 news, channel 10 news, Murdoch media. That’s the cause.
2. Percentages don’t tell the story properly when there are so many variables. The type of crime, severity, location, who was targeted (residential vs retail/business) drugs vs physical harm vs damage vs theft, etc. Are those figures lumping all of that together? For example, the whole percentage may be going down, but *residential* theft might be higher than it used to be. And if that’s the case, people are rightfully fearing for their safety. I know many people who had a break in for the first time ever in the past 2-3 years, myself included.
3. I live just outside Toowoomba and occasionally I look at our local Facebook group. It's full of LNP voting freaks posting alerts about teenagers walking around the neighbourhood. Not doing anything - just walking around. Like teenagers do. "Heads up! 3 kids in hoodies walking down Paranoid St. Anyone keeping an eye on them?" We've lived here for 8 years and never had any trouble whatsoever. But if you look at the FB page for this area, you'd think we live in a war zone. Its fucking ridiculous.
4. Channel 7, there's ya problem. Owned by that guy who funded the legal cases of both Bruce Luhrmann, rapist, and Ben Roberts-Smith, alleged war-criminal.
5. I haven't looked at the stats, but is there anything about the number of crimes and the severity? It's all well and good to say "per capita crime is down" when we've had a massive influx of immigration from other states and other countries, and if we're including petty theft and kids just generally being little arse holes, to straight up murdering grandmas in the street. Not saying I believe the news, but I don't believe it's as simple as "Number go up, number go down"
6. I'm curious what the crime was compared to 10 years ago
7. You won’t get the truth with data from the police. They are money hungry and not qualified for many areas they tackle!
8. The rectangular plastic box is essentially a machine that buys votes at a given rate for whoever has the money to pay.
9. As long as Murdock owns most of the East Coast newspapers and some of the TV news channels,you are always going to have our version of Fox News US
10. The only people who watch legacy media are the oldies. The oldies love conservative messages. The oldies respond and are riveted to stories of chaos outside the walls of their retirement living areas." Have a look at the kinds of ads that are on free to air TV and in the papers - and you'll see its old legacy trusted brands and messages. Make no mistake, the media know the demographic they have left and milk it to within an inch of its life.
11. Don’t live in QLD and also don’t consume QLD news, but have had to work with government departments on reporting public numbers. Have experienced the “pressure” to adjust statistics to report what supports KPI’s. Typically in the form of redefining what is considered outliers or included data to form the trend. Wondering how much is relevant, because I don’t think anyone in QLD who is “clutching their pearls” is necessarily just watching the news and feeling anxious.
12. Important media literacy questions: who owns this publication, and who's paying their bills?
13. Explain to me how crime per capita is a more sensible metric when crime in your neighbourhood is at an all-time high? As a citizen, why would I care about crime per capita if an increased rate of crime in my neighbourhood puts me at more risk of being a victim of crime? You're being disingenuous by finding the 1 statistic that supports your narrative.
14. Thank you for posting this. We in the FNQ have very different conditions from SEQ. I don't need to refer to police statistics. I know it's not safe. Two of my neighbour has break-ins last week. Three weeks ago I had a trespasser at 2 am (luckily I woke up). I did not report the trespasser because it's useless anyway. Who will tell me that lower crime rates are not due to people not reporting anymore. But I'm willing to believe that situation is different in Brisbane.
15. Secondly to that we did shift our focus and the change in how DV is reported as a crime is a big factor in any change or upward movement in crime stats.
16. Townsville definitely has a problem. It has for a long time. I’m not sure a change in gov is going to help unfortunately. In the long run it may even make it worse. Fixing socioeconomic disadvantage is more holistic than locking kids up.
17. The issue isn't "more youth crime than previous" the issue is the severity of crimes being committed, 20 years ago youth crime was graffiti and drugs now its car theft, break and enter, grievous bodily harm, etc etc, all with slaps on the wrist.
18. Just because it feels like it's happening doesn't mean it is. With modern social media suddenly making it sound like your hundreds of friends are your mates that aren't, you hear about it non-stop. What's actually happening though is the algorithm is referencing the far more engaged with anecdote.
19. I have two mates in Townsville who have had threesomes three times in the past few months. In all three cases, they were easy targets by uncompromising women, last two weeks. Must mean there are a lot more people getting threesomes, these women have either haven’t been caught, or when they are, they have been released. There is video footage of these women with copious amounts of lubricant and toys, entering each other etc This makes me feel in certain parts of the state it is increasing. It’s almost an unspoken part of being in North Queensland, a when rather than if, you will get your bugle blown (ADF pun for added affect)
20. I looked into the crime statistics a couple weeks ago on the qld police website in regards to the crime crisis and delved into the northern regions thinking that even though statistically crime is down overall for the state it could still be increasing in regional areas, but places like Townsville and Cairns etc are also reporting an overall decrease.
21. And locking them up won't solve the problem, just kick it down the street.
22. It’s wrong to dismiss the human factor. Crime has a very real human impact that just looking at stats can’t convey.
23. The 1800s? I mean they did send a lot of young people over here as convicts sure, but I’m not sure it’s the same thing.
24. The Facebook groups are a big part of it. Every day I see at least one post about a car theft or break in, but in the past 5 years I can only think of two people I actually know having their cars stolen. People get an exaggerated idea of the scale of crime.
25. I made a single post about how Moreton City Council wouldn't collect bins on our street back in April/May that went viral on r/brisbane that got hundreds of comments. Nobody in the past would ever have given a shit, but suddenly, I was getting bombarded with messages on Reddit and Facebook from journalists left right and centre wanting to run my story. I was on 7 News's night national news AND tiktok and I had the ABC write articles about it that was probably heard or read by hundreds of thousands of people total all things considered. We had the developers of this estate because of how much it blew up knocking doors about it when it emerged that there was evidence of dodgy dealings getting non compliant designs approved by council workers and now all my contact details with them are blacklisted and Moreton City Council also blocked my number that I used to initially make my complaint lmao. If something as petty and dumb as a street's bins not getting picked up can generate that level of publicity and engagement, you can imagine how much worse it will get with something far more serious like a break and entry or car-jacking.
26. So you're saying people believe what they hear via word of mouth, as opposed to ... you know, actual recorded crime statistics and facts as recorded by Police?
27. Given that juvenile detention facilities are frequently full of- when the average stay is relatively short - and there has been huge scandals over the mistreatment of juvenile offenders in adult detention facilities, then there’s clearly an increase.
28. It's statewide improved. The difference is the emergence of tight-knit community groups and how social media algorithms work. In places like Brisbane these will be a few suburbs of a few thousand people. In cities like Mackay (my hometown), they tend to be the entire city and the communities feel like they're tight knit (which they aren't but believe they are). Now, in these community groups on Facebook there's thousands of users all posting about shit in there. Now one user has a break in or a car theft and posts about it. People see this and their immediate response is to do something like a care react and comment their sympathy. The Facebook algorithm sees this and realises this post creates more interaction that retains engagement to the site that they want for advertiser profits. So Facebook props this up to the top of the news feed for everybody. Everybody then sees the posts, and does the same thing. This encourages the algorithm to continue to proliferate this anecdotal story and learn that this sort of content is what generates the most engagement and thus profit. So when a similar anecdotal post is made down the line, it will push this to the top again to ram the same money making shit down everybody's throats. Eventually is hearing about it every day making it feel like it's happening more. What's actually happening though is these anecdotes have triggered a negative feedback loop. As these regional and rural towns have larger community groups that aren't as decentralised, they have a larger sample size of users to fish anecdotes from that get pushed to the top of everybody's consciousness every day in and out. If you actually took the time though to go through each and every single post in these groups, you'd quickly realise however that they are in fact anecdotes.
29. We do have a policing shortage, but also we have decreasing youth crime statistics so clearly what your describing isn't the reality. There is no youth crime crisis. Youth crime is literally the lowest it's ever been in Queensland's history and criminologists have all shown this.
30. That’s a pretty uncompassionate response - don’t think of the horrible thing affecting you or the people you know, think of the broad data set instead.
31. ~~Murdoch anti-union propaganda machine~~ Fox Ne- I mean Quest Newspapers.
32. Because ... statistics (see link) Youth crime is down 6.7%, while domestic violence flagged offences rose from being 24.4% of assaults in 2019/2020 to 56.9% of all assaults by 2023/2024. [Queensland Police Service release latest crime statistics for 2023/24 financial year - Queensland Police News](https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/news/2024/07/26/queensland-police-service-release-latest-crime-statistics-for-2023-24-financial-year/) Excerpt from link: "As a proportion of total offence rates, Domestic Violence offences continue to grow. For example, in relation to assault offences, in 2019-2020 Domestic Violence accounted for 24.4% of total assault offences, while in 2023-2024 it accounted for 56.9% of total assault offences. It demonstrates the scale of domestic violence offending and how important it is that everyone in the community works together to stamp out this scourge on society". Also, if you scroll down to the 'gender of aggrieved' on the link below, you will see that over 80% are female: [DFV statistics | Queensland Courts](https://www.courts.qld.gov.au/court-users/researchers-and-public/stats)
33. What matters is the per capita rate, not the total crime count, but media reports anecdotes rather than statistics.
34. Inciting fear in the population is a sure way to win elections. Simple scaremongering. It's wrong, but a tale as old as time.
35. Youth crime has been in the media for ages. And one scandal that seems to have just gone quietly unresolved is that there has not been sufficient custody facilities for young people being detained and they were being horrifically abused in adult facilities.
36. This is a good point too - incidences of crime have increased because the population has increased. Crime rates - which are calculated based on population - are going down. Asd to this the media loving those doorbell camera videos and people are terrified
37. It’s also personal experience and severity. Youth crime as a fact may have gone down percentage wise, but the *types* of crime is affecting us more than it ever did. Kids were very rarely breaking into homes and stealing car keys years ago. Also, and this is just my opinion, we don’t have much cash anymore, or VCRs or even DVD players, and our TVs and stereos are too big. So that could be a reason they turned to cars.
38. You do need to factor tr aging population as well though, the median age is now almost 40 so the % of population under 18 has been degreasing over time.
39. Yeah honestly I couldn't really give a shit about brats shoplifting or graffitiing or whatever. It's annoying, but doesn't really harm me and there's pretty immediate things that can be done to resolve it. I really give a shit about people's homes being broken into, cars being pinched and people being stabbed and shit.
40. Right, so what you’re really saying is that you don’t like facts and prefer to go on your gut feeling based on what the media feeds you. All good, we get it and you’re not alone … people by and large are gullible and easy marks
41. Wouldn't they inflate the numbers? If they are saying crime has decreased what does that mean?
42. conservative think tanks aren't stupid, they also have plenty of sockpuppets on social media spreading their message
43. I'm not sure if I'm considered an "oldie" yet (almost 50), but I have zero interest in conservative messages, The Courier-Fail, Nine/Seven "News" (although I do read Brisbane Times a bit; it's not entirely impartial, but certainly better than their TV offerings). I haven't voted for any kind of conservative party for > 30 years. So much for the old story about people becoming more conservative as they age.
44. They definitely are. They are Facebook and newspaper frightened. Some old lady posted on Facebook if it was OK to leave her car at my work. Overwhelmingly, members of the public told her it would be stolen when she got back. I have worked their over ten years, and not a single car has been stolen or broken into. But I am betting you that she was fearful, completely unnecessary.
45. It’s definitely going to be a factor in this case given people in power are definitely trying to downplay this and things like the abuse of kids in police custody.
46. THIS 100%. Most people seem to lack critical thinking skills.
47. Are you expanding on what I said or asking a super vague question expecting a list of who owns every publisher?
48. >As a citizen, why would I care about crime per capita if an increased rate of crime in my neighbourhood puts me at more risk of being a victim of crime? Perhaps you’d benefit by actually reading my comment? Because there simply isn’t an increased **rate** of crime - that’s my point. I’ll try again with an even more weighted example. If 1 in 10 people, of a ten person village, is experiencing crime: the crime rate is 10%. Now let’s say an extra 90 people moved into the village, but only one other person is experiencing crime. There are now 2 victims of crime in population of 100 villagers. Yes, the number of victims of crime has doubled, but per capita 2/100 is only 2%. Now just 2% of the population is effected by crime, and the **rate** of crime victims has actually shrunk to 5 times less than what it was (from 10 to 2%). That is why per capita makes infinitely more sense than just counting the number of criminals. Because your neighbourhood has even more people, and is actually now safer for your family - because there is less chance you and your family will be victims of crime, as a result from standing in a bigger crowd.
49. You're at less risk. As the poster showed, in the first hypothetical year the risk is 10%, in the third year it's 6.7%.
50. Yes, if those words are very limited and don’t provide the context and so belie the actual truth people who use those words are trying to paint.
51. Yeah, the crime is really ridiculous up here. I'm moving back to Brisbane next year for a number of reasons (might come back as theres a lot to like up here). I lived in bris 4 years prior and never had any crimes committed against me- it's just heaps safer there. No way I'd walk home at night in Cairns anymore. I've never filed so many police reports in my life in the last 4 years. I've had my spare bike stolen 6 months ago (adults), my license plates stolen 3 weeks ago by losers in a stolen vehicle (adults on camera). 7 cars were stolen from just my complex of 18 units last year alone... (this was all children/youths) by doorknob cranking, Breaking/entering and stealing keys. I've had my doorknob broken about 4 times the last couple years (100 bucks every time to fix it) - I've got a bolt latch to prevent further . It's in nearly every neighbourhood too Cops are understanding but clearly overwhelmed and burned out.
52. If the LNP addresses the underlying cause, then what drum will they be able to beat to keep people scared and voting for them?
53. Back then it was “the natives are killing our innocent farmers, we must exterminate them”
54. Yeah since the late 1800's, basically as long as there has been press in the colony.
55. I got off fakebook because every weekday afternoon around 3pm the local page would be full of "teenagers walking down the street making noise, lock your houses!!!" And if you dare point out that it's kids walking home from school you'd be piled on.
56. Sorta. When folk talk about social media pushing things they’re more talking about algorithm based content, I’m referring to more organic communities. For example I live in Yarrabilba, so I joined the Yarrabilba Community Page, so I’m more likely to hear about crime in Yarrabilba that others post entirely because of my own actions placing me into that group instead of it being algorithmically driven.
57. It's both algorithms and organic groups. Organic groups are tightly knit but consisting of thousands of people - so it feels way more personally connected and occurring when in reality you've just broadened your sample size and found the anecdote. But because these posts create the most engagement with outpourings of anger, sympathy and support with the most comments and reactions, the algorithm pushes these to the top of your news feed every time creating a negative feedback loop. You probably don't read every single post every day in these groups, but if you did you'd see there's WAY more other stories that aren't so drastic all the time that you're just not hearing about. You're getting flooded with bad news and it's becoming your whole existence warping your perception AND it feels more like its personally effecting you than it is. Karen Johnson might talk to all the time in comments in your local community group and you might think you're close, but bitch you ain't even met her before.
58. People latch onto stories they hear because they’re relatable and tangible. Stats often miss emotional impact. You hear a friend worried about crime, it sticks more than dry numbers. I’ve tried social media sharing and spreading community news through platforms like Nextdoor and Facebook groups, similar to how businesses connect using Sprout Social or Pulse for Reddit. This widespread communication makes personal anecdotes feel more present and pressing.
59. And I wonder if there’s a correlation between more juveniles in custody and less juvenile crime?
60. Haha yes exactly. You really do have to turn the argument on its head so it becomes apparent how ridiculous this line of thinking is Your mate's car got stolen and he got threatened as they made off with it? Your mother feeling unsafe in her own home because she woke up with strange people in it? "Look at the broad trend and shut the fuck up you politically charged fearmongering piece of shit - don't you dare even speak about it - or I'll draw data sets from the 1980s and call you a sky news viewer"
61. What’s the magic of 2019? What about the longer term trend? We can play the game of duelling statistics if you like but I suspect we won’t convince each other. If you look at the stats you’ll also find that rates of violence in same sex female relationships are about the same as male-female relationships. So domestic violence isn’t just a male-female problem.
62. So, depending on where you are, house burglary and break-and-enters were actually one of the categories of crimes that had decreased. This is the problem: what you're seeing on the news and hearing about bears little resemblance to what's actually happening. As you point out, there's less to gain now from breaking into someone's house.
63. These two paragraphs together back to back is one of the dumbest things I have ever read.
64. Do you understand how statistics work? Such a stupid, arrogant take. Confidently incorrect
65. That they are doing their job which clearly is not possible and the fact they keep asking for more money?
66. YouTube this morning blasted me with vile LNP crying victim mom videos about Labour youth crime. The teenager next to me laughed and saw through the obvious emotional appeal. I have faith in a younger generation.
67. You are generation x, me too. And yeah, we are old now. But I think it is some of us and alot of boomers.
68. there is evidence that gen X are not going as conservative as boomers did as they age also.
69. They just lack the training/education. Same as me not being able to do calculus.
70. And yet each one of them must vote! So we have this political platforms that are boiled down to simple fear based messaging to motivate the rubes.
71. Wouldn't you have show crime rate per capita by area to paint an accurate picture which would show increasing crime rates in rural areas. My other contention would be increasing populations pushes people out of the city into more affordable, yet higher crime rate areas. The experience of your average punter matters, and the predominate experience would be 'increase in youth/other crime'. Having more crime in your area matters, even if there are more people. There's only so many businesses etc to rob in one area.
72. Addressing socio economic disadvantage is literally against the LNP's religion. Don't hold your breath on them fixing that.
73. At least admitting there’s a an issue is better than denying it.
74. This is 100% true for me as well I lived in one suburb, and it's community page was always talking about crime, when I moved to a new suburb I stopped seeing those notifications and now see the local ones again
75. True, however while people's personal anecdotes may evoke the emotions of the wider community, they do not necessarily mean a whole state has a 'crisis' on its hands. But I appreciate that it can seem that way. Hopefully people are actually reporting all instances of crime and not just posting it on their local community facebook page. The only way to officially convince govts that more funding, police, resources, etc, need to be allocated; or if legislation needs to change, is via official stats.
76. Last time I saw a stat and I'll admit it was a while ago, the average time in custody was under 2 months. So very unlikely.
77. 2019 was mentioned as it appears in the stats I linked. The stats on any "longer term trend" would be on record, I'm sure. Google is pretty easy to use. Police and court crime stats can't be argued with. Politicians don't legislate - or base budgets for govt spending - on people's anecdotes. Where did I mention anywhere that domestic violence was only a "male - female problem"? "So domestic violence isn't just a male -female problem". I know. Nowhere did I mention it was. I simply provided the official stats - via Queensland Courts statistics - that showed 'domestic violence against women' (which is what you mentioned in your original post). No break down on what gender committed the violence as the topic is 'violence against women', not 'violence against women by men', so I'm not sure why you felt the need to school me on that?
78. But is the normal conspiracy logic that they inflate the crime to say they need more money? If their stats show its decreasing then wouldn't that mean the current spending is fine?
79. I got that YouTube ad today as well and I thought they were meant to suspend political advertising
80. And I'm not going to just assume that, people have asked for less rational things.
