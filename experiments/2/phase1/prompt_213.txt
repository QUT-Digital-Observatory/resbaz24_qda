Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èor maybe don‚Äôt be so easily offended. I do get what you mean tho, but without witnessing it ourselves we have nothing but a he said she said.
2. Just as a thing a DnC after a miscarriage isn't an abortion abortion is the act of "Terminating" the Pregnancy as this is a very important issue its important to be accurate.
3. Yes I did read that, but the premise of the conversation was concern over the posting of (what turned out to be) non existent content.
4. Recording phone calls without informing the other party using a built in device is federally illegal. So something of a moot point in regards to recording interstate communications. And no you cant publish recording if someone fucks you over, you probably could utilise it if they sued you for defamation or you wanted to sue them for breach of contract.
5. You are wrong, on publishing secretly recorded communications. From Qld legal aid: https://www.legalaid.qld.gov.au/Find-legal-information/Personal-rights-and-safety/Privacy-and-identity/Privacy Publishing or communicating recordings of conversations Even if you were involved in a conversation that was legally recorded, it‚Äôs still illegal to communicate the conversation or publish it without the permission of the other people involved in the conversation (with some exceptions). However, you may be able to use it as evidence in court proceedings. Its straight up federally illegal under the Telecommunications Interception and Access Act to secretly record phone calls, so even using them in court is going to be highly dubious.
6. Its legal to record, its not legal to go ahead and publish it, basically the only time secret recordings can be legally published is in court proceedings. Qld law is pretty clear on this. https://www.gnl.com.au/articles/2021/march/recording-conversations/
7. Oh I didn't think any that. Anyway. He's earning 3 to 5 times what I've ever sent in a year, to talk to people and pretend to care. It's shite.
8. Oh 100%. He has a cushy $170,000/yr job, why would he want to give that up. I'm surprised I got him to answer my questions on abortion just by asking enough times in a row to irritate him into saying what he really thinks. How does youth crime translate to increased house prices? What a strange guy
9. I thought the Toowoomba north electorate was only about 35,000 people though? Last election he got 57% of votes, which means there is actually a real chance of him being replaced by a Labor candidate in the near future
10. I was looking into it just now, and doctors can also agree to a late term abortions if they believe that there is a severe imminent risk of the mother committing s****de due to mental health conditions such as schizophrenia. Do you have a source of doctors removing children's breasts for non-medical reasons? Yeah, that's what puberty blockers are for... To block puberty temporarily... What did you think they were for? It's not 'off label' if that's what it's for
11. "in 2018, Queensland decriminalised abortion up to 22 weeks' gestation without a doctor's permission" Upon OP drilling him, Trevor stated that he doesn't want late term abortions performed. I.e. he voted against a bill regarding early term abortions, because he doesn't like late term abortions. I.e. he didn't read the thing in question. As for the last line there; I'd rather loss of breast tissue which could be regrown(obviously, otherwise transwomen on Estrogen in later life wouldn't grow them at all) over the teen in question "handling the situation". And I'd rather a child have time to learn and make an informed decision about their body instead of forcing them to take hormones that will change their bodies in ways they may regret or resent, I am well aware how the phrasing there looks but I'm not saying HRT for the 10yo, I'm saying they may go through the wrong puberty for them and people are trying to FORCE them through it despite the fact that we have the capacity to prevent errors in those who can speak up and say "this might not be right for me"
12. Of course the interstate is dubious because its all party consent in NSW. But it's one party on QLD and VIC.
13. The Invasion of Privacy Act 1971 (Qld) states that a participant to a private conversation ‚Äì whether in person, via telephone or other electronic communication (e.g. Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Messenger, WhatsApp or Houseparty) ‚Äì can legally record the conversation in Queensland without any knowledge, notification or consent of the other party or parties to the conversation Since this was an in-person conversation that occurred in Queensland, a recording taken by the person involved with the conversation is totally legal.
14. Labor held Toowoomba North from 2001-2012. At his peak Kerry Shine had a higher vote than Trevor, but it all change within a few elections. It could change again
15. 57% of the vote is huge idk why you think that's close. Add into that other preferences and stuff Toowoomba North isn't going anywhere
16. IIRC we're one party consent to record, the rules more apply to how you can use those recordings. But one of the rules that allow it is if it's in the public interest, and I'm pretty sure a candidate talking about their policy positions in a public space to a member of the public would be in the public interest to publish.
17. I was replying to someone asking a question about recording phone calls, not in person conversations. Telecommunications are federally regulated and the TIAA renders secretly recording phone calls illegal. Qld or any other state law is immaterial to the federal law.
18. Section 6 of the Telecommunications Interception and Access Act 1979. This is fairly well understood in the telecommunications industry, its why every company that records calls lets the person know at the start of the call.
19. I wonder why it changed. Would you ever consider trying for MP for Labor or the Greens?
20. We'll see. State government is on my radar, but a lot would have to fall into place before then
21. If you ever decide to, hit me up. I can rally together a decent group of people who would be more than happy to volunteer and help you out :)
22. Thank you. If I do run again I'll need all the help I can get
23. Which roads do we use to get intimate with drivers?
24. I've lived in Ipswich for well over ten years and something that really irritates me is the lack of pedestrian care. Sometimes I'll be waiting at the zebra crossing outside Silkstone State School (Glebe road) and several cars will zoom through before someone stops. One time I was riding along the footpath with my son and some knob reversed out of his house and pushed me backwards. Another time, I was riding with my partner and the footpath was blocked. I said to her "I hate selfish arseholes that do this" and said fuckwit was in his yard (unbeknownst to me) yelled out "that's my car, you got something to say about it hey". Honestly, the walkability of Ipswich is so poor but car drivers really need to show more care to pedestrians.
25. I don‚Äôt have any problems at silkstone but man is there a lot of sirens
26. Went through for the first time recently, here's my two cents: that town was not designed for cars, as a result the roadways are not set out in a reasonable fashion for motorists, leading to sloppy driving and anger.
27. I feel like people drive way better here than they do in Brisbane. Maybe it's the areas of town you're driving in but it definitely hasn't been my experience at all
28. Look, it‚Äôs not Ipswich, it‚Äôs just qld drivers. Don‚Äôt take it personally when the young hoon/meth-rager needs to be first - let them go. Also don‚Äôt expect that anyone in the entire state knows that a dashed line means give way, particularly on a merge.
29. I work in booval and a small proportion of the customers who come in are shall we say, from a lower socioeconomic demographic. It is usually these people with loud and rude behaviour that give the whole area a bad name. The vast majority of the customers are ok, but these ones in particular make working in retail very hard. Makes me want to escape civilisation and only interact with a handful of other people and only do so when I choose to.
30. I've really had to work on not getting angry at the absolute fuckwit drivers around here. They can be 100% in the wrong and if you beep them they rage at you. It's not worth the stress, just let them go.
31. Unfortunately, I don't think this is just in Ipswich. I work in Brisbane and see it pretty much everywhere there too. A lot of people are stressed and angry and vent it on the roads. It sux, I know. I just try my best to keep my cool and get away from bad drivers. I know that's easier said than done.
32. Don‚Äôt know how to edit, but I meant intimidate not intimate thanks
33. Reading this thread makes me so happy I moved up to Gladstone at Xmas. SEQ was getting me down, too crowded, too hectic. Living the dream up here. Peace my QLD people
34. You moved to one of the redneck capitols of the state. That's it.
35. Idk but the open use of meth on the main streets might be clue
36. I've only lived here bot even two years and have found people to be quite nice in ipswich, i have never encountered anyone rude.
37. Try driving in Auckland New Zealand. You will appreciate how much politer and friendlier motorists are in Ipswich. Just find young guys driving utes a bit impatient. Wonder whether they pick up many speeding fines.
38. We have noticed it got worse after Covid. We blamed all the NSW Mexicans crossing the border and moving here.
39. I think it‚Äôs just reflective of the times, and of everywhere, not just Ipswich. Get out of the city areas anywhere and it‚Äôs immediately a bit more chill. Go to the Gold Coast or Byron Bay, and boom, jerks abound. I imagine even more built up areas like Sydney are worse.
40. I think it's indicative of the societal issues that we are all facing at the moment. High inflation, higher interest rates or rent payments, low stagnant wages, poor employment security, fraying fabric of society, rampant methamphetamine use, non policing of crime, geopolitical instability with escalating tensions with China and lets not forget the simplest answer, that people are just assholes.
41. It‚Äôs horrible isn‚Äôt it the way society is heading , Probably social media and the likes, everyone is complaining how unhappy they are
42. Any road you like, honey. Just tell me where ![gif](giphy|10UUe8ZsLnaqwo)
43. Most intercity, roundabouts , shopping centres, and then there‚Äôs all the hoops trying to race you , lots of burn outs at night Whitehill Rd and Ripley area , I‚Äôd say p platers and young tradies in utes .
44. Absolutely agree , what can be done about it because no one‚Äôs listening or just live that way.
45. Yes, that crossing is horrible! My husband and I were walking our two dogs and had to wait until 5 cars blew through that crossing, presumably because they wanted to save 30 seconds.
46. The one on Blackstone Road is even worse. It‚Äôs like people don‚Äôt realise the zebra crossings are always active, even if there‚Äôs not flags and a crossing attendant.
47. I grew up in Booval. It's comforting to know the sirens are still putting the children to sleep.
48. Yep just look at how the middle of town is built, its design is the same as it was originally with the smaller road meant for horse and carriage not cars (Legit pictures of it in the museum) and with heritage buildings on most of both sides its not easy to expand, so you have to have Two main streets that go one way each :/ Its a pain even having lived here most of my life. There is also a horrible problem with half the traffic lights in Ipswich, some of them will happily let you sit their for ages when no one else is there, and there are a couple roads where if you see a line up of vehicles at the lights sometimes its legitimately better to use an alternative route since sometimes the driver in the lead isn't even close enough to the white line to trigger the damn sensors on the road (Yes we have sensors in most places, but one does sometime have to wonder if some of them were placed Past the white line) >\_>
49. Brisbane is just Super confusing, if you are driving with someone from brisbane they are usually great, its that so many others pass through it and thats not a fun experience (Especially if you want a park), i've driven up their exactly twice once to south bank and the other to Milton and both trips are one of the handful of times ive ever had to use parallel parking, And I refuse to do it ever again otherwise i just feel like i am part of the problem aswell xD ill just drive up the train line a bit and catch one the rest of the way.
50. Don't forget the little old grandpa's and grandmas that insist they can still see properly who just happen to get real lucky with misses when they cut off 20 people in a row You ever seen a 30 point turn? I missed half of it but thats because I went in to do my shopping for 15 minutes and came back out to the same old dude trying to escape the parking lot, And finally, with merge lanes, does not help that on entry ramps there is way to many people who slow down or don't want to hit the speed limit before they get onto the highway. that shit freaks me out and its not safer in any sense of the word O.o
51. As someone that moved from Brisbane to Ipswich in the last twelve months, the first thing I noticed was how much more aggressive drivers are here.
52. Oooh. Taste the sass. Meeeow. Edit. Comment made before I saw you were female. I probably would have made the same comment. Pretty sure you get it anyway.
53. yeah it's usually utes for me, tailgating, etc I dont give a flying fuck - I drive the speed limit and if they put too much pressure I may even go 10k lower feel free to speed up and pass me (where it's illegal usually), cunts
54. Ooof lived in Booval for awhile I had the train line to put me to sleep but I was Not unaware of the bike gangs and all the drugs just over the way in Bundamba, There was also a dude who would walk up and down one of the longer streets with a katana on his back, so you know that Made EVERYONE feel very safe of course /s
55. I totally know what you mean but I lived in Brisbane for years and since moving to Ippy it's really apparent how much more calm the roads are here. In town at least, the motorway can be another story! I also think that driving around Brisbane has gotten way way worse in the last few years. Everywhere is just so much busier!
56. sooo much more aggressive here! the amount of times people on my street get beeped for daring to pull into their driveways is crazy.
57. Have we been nuked yet? No? Sign says the truth. *mic drop
58. Its the law of the road but im stoned and i got a full tank, baby!
59. Yep. It‚Äôs the tradies for me, even more so those ‚Äúbig utes‚Äù. I think it‚Äôs a bully mentality sometimes. I‚Äôve noticed it more since I downgraded to a Yaris from a bigger car. I don‚Äôt get it when I‚Äôm driving around in the work van.
60. Do you have a source? (Not jumping to you being wrong) I know smart lights are a thing and I wish we had them everywhere but I hadn't heard them being mass used here or anywhere else in Australia. I know they use infrared but that's only to track pedestrian flow From what I know of traffic sensors they usually use piezoelectric sensors or induction loops (and SCAT in Sydney and STREAMS in Qld definitely use induction loops atm. Also if there were smart lights in the places that are problematic there either shouldn't be an issue with traffic Or the lights themselves are utterly garbage :/
61. Lol I suppose desperate times called for desperate measures üòÇ
62. Not surprised. He almost ended up as mayor. I don‚Äôt know how. Dudes creepy as fuck. Something very off about him.
63. How did you elect this guy‚Ä¶ And I don‚Äôt live in the city anymore, but how did Andrew Antoniolli get back in?
64. This is so disappointing. We've lived in Ipswich 10 years and when Russell lead Div. 4 and was Deputy Mayor, he was such an asset. When we had problems with a new development in our neighbourhood, he came out and met with the area, spoke to each and every one of us and actually actioned our concerns. And every time we've headed to the polling booths, he has been there and has always been ready for a friendly chat. Voters have really shat the bed with this one.
65. He says he won't be swayed by the other councillors against the mayor. Pull the other one David. It plays Jingle Bells
66. Ran into him at riverlink, made an effort not to talk, no chance was he getting my vote
67. Aside from running for every single election in Ipswich for the last 300 years, what‚Äôs the issue with the guy?
68. i don‚Äôt know much about him, why is this bad?
69. Fuck I hate first-past-the-post, it‚Äôs an awful way to select leaders.
70. All the oldies would have votes for him no doubt. Stuck in their ways.
71. You must have been walking around in a bubble of unreality, Dave was everywhere.
72. What an absolute crap show the next 4 years will be. No idea what people were thinking.
73. Maybe because he was running against another Andrew (the incumbent) and people got them mixed up.
74. He was a councillor in 2017 and was sacked as part of the corruption inquiry in 2018. Rumoured to have connections to property developers. Doesn't reside in division 4 (that may be wrong). And is a serial instigator of political rhetoric. On the other hand is a ipswich local through and through and has great background for politics. I personally wouldn't mind if he was actually present in the areas that make up div 4. Like I said. I've met spike a half dozen times and sue twice. Both had time to chat, were able to sympathise and advise on my particular local problems with personal experience and anecdotes. Oh and Martin's "how to vote cards" for this election were being investigated by the ECQ for irregularities - which probably comes from being a serial campaigner. Edit Links: https://www.ccc.qld.gov.au/corruption/outcome/allegations-corruption-related-ipswich-city-council-operation-windage https://www.ipswichtribune.com.au/council/political-comeback-for-former-mayor https://www.ipswichtribune.com.au/ipswich/ecq-to-investigate-invalid-martin-vote-cards
75. Another dismissed councillor, stole from Bunnings - there‚Äôs articles if you Google
76. I saw lots of signs in Walloon, thagonna and Rosewood ( my div 4 bubble) but no physical presence. Where did you chat to him?
77. Where did I say I had a chat with him?
78. Out in the community. I don't think you can argue he hasn't been out campaigning... Oh wait, you are.
79. What an insightful and revealing conversation full of good faith, data and insights from another community member. I'm so glad I tried to engage in dialogue with someone of an opposing opinion to better educate myself about the councillor for my division who seems so widely disliked yet secured a large vote without a physical presence in major population centres of the division. I even acknowledged in another comment he has a good background for politics. Like why be insuferable?
80. I'm not in opposition to your opinion, I thought Russell should have won. Doesn't change the fact I saw Dave out and about in the community. I also saw Georgia Toft, Wendy Bourne, and Russell Milligan. But I honestly saw Dave Martin in more places than any of them
81. I've seen Chris Cheney 'inthe community' before Doesn't mean he was out listening to people's concerns haha
82. And I didn't talk to any of them, as I'm sure you are wondering.
83. Personally, I think donations to political parties should only be able to be made by individuals- not companies, not lobby groups. Any donation over a small amount (say $500) should be on a public record, and donations should be capped per individual at a sensible value.
84. I kinda wanna donate $1 so the justice party can show something.
85. Let it never be said these elections are fair when corporations are trying to buy government members (and you know exactly of which party they‚Äôre trying)
86. I hope every cent of the Blue Bar, goes to waste.
87. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs 20 LNP placards for every 5 Labor and every 1 Greens, I suppose.
88. Not really surprising. The Liberal party are just millionaires paid by billionaires to create laws that benefit millionaires and billionaires.
89. Hi Qld Minerals Council here, inexplicably we have misplaced $4,125,260. Last seen in a brown paper bad. If found don't worry about it, we reckon we'll get it back in spades.
90. can we just round up all the greens people and send to alice springs
91. i think all political donations should go to a bucket that gets equally shared to all political parties. and any attempt to donate to an individual be treated as a bribe that has corruption investigation charges follow it.
92. Happy Labor lost. Bunch of bogans and tradies tide to CFMEU.
93. Is that surprising given the IR changes the labor party has implemented with essentially no industry consultation?
94. Donations shouldn‚Äôt be allowed at all. Your success as a political party shouldn‚Äôt depend on whether those you‚Äôll benefit have money or not. We also don‚Äôt want a US situation in which individuals are being told to donate to their preferred political party for ‚Äúthe survival of your country‚Äù. People talk about donating with pride. The politicians work for you. They are already funded, even for political campaigns. We do not want to set up a ‚Äúpay to play‚Äù system where people feel that they need to pay for their preferred political party to have a chance to get in.
95. I agree. There's just so many ways to evade it. Like the Greens MPs who routinely make $6k donations. There's no way to know how & what those donations actually are. Something needs to be done, but I admit that it's an incredibly complex issue to solve. All eyes will be on South Australia as they attempt to remove money from politics. It'll be a great opportunity to learn from.
96. That only means so much when they can just run their own propaganda campaigns, like the Queensland Resources Candidates and their "Keep Queensland Competitive" BS.
97. While you are at it. Put a cap on what the parties can spend on elections. Outlaw coalitions. If your party doesn‚Äôt have the asses in seats to form government, then they don‚Äôt form government. No teaming up with other parties to the detriment of everyone. Permit conscience voting regardless of party or the bill in question. Way to many are FORCED to vote with the party against their constituents.
98. I'd agree with that if people on welfare were prohibited from voting if we are against potential conflicts of interest, let's be consistent
99. Or better yet, vote for your local Ipswich Labor candidate so Milesy gets back in. Ipswich - Jennifer Howard Bundamba - Lance McCallum Ipswich West - Wendy Bourne Jordan - Charis Mullen
100. Brown paper bag? I didn't know Mick Fuller was in Queensland.
101. Only if we get a federal Labor majority in both houses. Pretty sure it's going to be an election promise.
102. That's just party funding. Let's not pretend that the LNP didn't have the coal industry funding their aligned campaigns. It takes a special kind of bootlicker to think that workers supporting the party that supports them is the same as being funded by the coal industry. https://preview.redd.it/z4f506nn24xd1.png?width=1026&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dedf4d41142e99d60f6d350dbee5a2f92a053c5a
103. Hint: it's from the coal industry in retaliation for Labor making them pay their fair share.
104. Except then your preventing those who would otherwise run for government who now no longer have any funds to advertise etc. turning it into a situation in which only those of a richer background can afford to run for government in the first place.
105. I haven't heard about what's happening in SA, I'll have a look
106. The greens have some of the most stringent donation laws going around. Not sure why you're throwing stones here..
107. Just ban political advertising altogether. Although that will never happen, neither of the majority parties would even support the truth in political advertising material
108. Why would being on welfare mean you shouldn't vote? Most people with children that work are on welfare. Childcare subsidies are welfare.
