Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Definitely, but the population in Melbourne is still climbing regardless. The fact that Melbourne is now cheaper than Brisbane will slow the rate people move north too
2. Considering the youngest of us is about to turn 30 in the next year or two, and the oldest is nearing their mid 40's, only 50% being a home owner is really bloody bad.
3. It‚Äôs so crazy. Stones Corner is close to the city, close to a bus way, close to parks, pretty close to a train line. Limiting anything to 3 storeys is mad.
4. ‚ÄúKeep the suburban feel‚Äù LMAO More like greedy NIMBYS want to restrict supply to have their property value skyrocket even further
5. Except the bigger way. The last thing we need is more sprawl. We have plenty of opportunities to densify. And not even apartments, just get some more row and town homes so people still get a bit of a yard
6. Ipswich Logan Moreton Bay & Redlands are still considered Brisbane when it comes to these statistics. It‚Äôs pretty rare for national statistics to only use BCC when they talk about ‚ÄûBrisbane‚Äú. On a national level ‚ÄûBrisbane‚Äú is anywhere from Caboolture to Beenleigh, from Wynnum to Ipswich, and everywhere in between.
7. Not really tbh. People are more likely to describe themselves as being from Frankston/Cragieburn/Geelong than calling it Melbourne. To someone from Vic, Ipswich basically is Brisbane.
8. It really is so scary for our kids. My 19yo son & his g/f (been together 2yrs) are fully locked in on their goal of buying property at some point, and they already know it'll likely be in the Ipswich area somewhere (not that that's a bad thing). They're both working full-time (g/f is also studying law) and are both just grinding & saving hard. My son is doing afternoon & overnight shift work just to get that higher pay. At their age, I was getting drunk at least 3 nights a week & living on buttered toast. It's sad to see our young adults already feeling trapped in the system when they should be off experiencing life and having adventures. I'm really proud of them though, they're prioritising their future because they know that's what's important.
9. Ironically this is exasperated by how popular Queensland is as a place to live. So if it's popular then clearly Labor wasn't all that shit. I'm not into politics though, and realistically it's likely that Queensland just has better lifestyle and weather üòÖ
10. Who knows. All I know is they did an upgrade to the sewerage system a few years back to accommodate an extra 20k people in the area so some level,of government is planning an increase.
11. I'm not pro LNP, I voted Labor, not least for abortion rights My question was to highlight the idiocy of bagging out LNP in advance for a price surge that occurred under Labor's watch in QLD, and runaway immigration under Labor federally I agree both are to blame along with reserve bank policies in the last 15 years here and in the US
12. We bought an old caravan. Thought being fuck it we can at least go away for a reasonable cost. We can't afford a house or have enough for a decent deposit. If shit hits the fan We have a place to stay at least and can move around. If at some point we have a.chanve to buy we can sell it to top up deposit money.
13. yeah that's on the cards for me at some point i reckon, my board game collection is too big though to put in an RV but suppose storage sheds are a thing
14. Saw a millennial complained about older people owning many houses. The fucker himself owns four, well fuck him.
15. Nah just get a better paying job (sage advice from Joe Hockey)
16. I think you have to priorities your health in this. If you don't. You'd be dead or on an addiction path in no time.
17. This is not how it works at all. If your home value goes up to $1.3M, you pay off the $640K loan you got from the bank and you have $660K. All from putting in a $160K deposit 10 years ago.
18. Unfortunately, people have been saying exactly this for the 40 odd years since I started paying attention. If you need to wait for the market to drop you may never get your chance. I waited until things plateaued for a year or two and then jumped. That may be the best you can hope for, short of a fairly complete collapse of the economy (which does no-one any favours except cashed up investors looking for a bargain). Think recession, defaults, foreclosures, bankruptcies, lay off's, severe market instability resulting in money fleeing to safe harbours like gold (not business investment) and so on. It will put pressure on governments as a result of severely reduced tax revenue, just when governments need to prime the pump. Not a pretty picture and one that a responsible government will and should seek to avoid. This is why we are where we are. There is no obvious way to deflate the balloon without it going *pop*.
19. I get tired of explaining this. EQUITY IS NOT MONEY IN THE BANK! You either have to sell - and find somewhere else to live - or take out a loan. It doesn't mean you're rich, it doesn't mean you have a "rich" lifestyle.
20. That's fine, I'm not defending the system. Its a shit show.
21. "And 17% was variable and not for the whole 30 years." Very true. It didn't last that long, but when the loan repayments under 17% soaked up so much of your post-tax income that you were considering that you might have to sell and downsize because you couldn't afford food, it's still scary. It's easy to say "don't borrow at 17%" but it was much much lower when I borrowed. Then I watched the payments go up while my salary didn't keep up. Thanks, Paul Keating, "world's greatest treasurer". I agree that the current situations sucks - that's why one of my adult children is still living here rent-free while they try to save for a deposit. Just don't say that my generation had it easy. It's not a competition, focus your anger on the people and policies that made it happen. Get those policies changed. Ring-fence negative gearing. Write off losses only against the property concerned, not against other income. That should fill a big hole in the taxation revenue budget. Don't forget, every investor's negative gearing is a tax hole that \*you\* have to fill. Sliding scale for CGT discount. Zero discount for first 2 years, then 10% per year thereafter. Cap immigration. We don't need skilled immigrants, we need skilled residents/citizens.
22. Ah yeah cheers I looked at 2000 not 2024. Like I said, I‚Äôm lazy haha
23. And they're the same round the country, Joh had fuck all to do with it
24. Nah I‚Äôm saying that if your saving for the average house and it goes from 600k to 1 mil in three years, even on that money saving hard you are going backwards as most likely even on those incomes you ain‚Äôt saving 400k in 3 years
25. My example is based on paying off an entire house, not buying it. A deposit is a hurdle, but it seems like people forget that you ahh have to pay off the mortgage right? So I‚Äôm saying you cannot save at the same rate that houses are increasing in value. Not that you can‚Äôt get a loan or save any money at all
26. Haha I appreciate people being supportive but I think if I hear "you'll get one" or "the right one will show up" again I might cry. Yeah it's hard for people that aren't in it but ya know, the right one will show up....
27. I hope so, it's been confronting to realise we won't be able to afford to rent in our neighbourhood (and some we know already forced out by prices) when every second person here now is part of a post-2020 Melbourne family raving about the cheap housing. Openly bitter about it.
28. Divorce / splitting assets ruined my chances of now owning anything. I dare say some of those younger than me will find themselves unfortunately in the same boat.
29. Most people living in a house are far more concerned with their experience. NIMBYs is correct, but their complaint is that "I don't want an apartment block destroying my view, or looking down into my backyard.". Property value by limiting supply is secondary to that.
30. The issue is, those homes are efficient to put in greenfield sites, but infill is expensive and inefficient. There aren‚Äôt many places to put them in.
31. But not the Sunny and Goldie? I get BLIMBR being consider Brisbane, but then why are Noosa and Surfers not also? (I can excuse Toowoomba on the grounds there is not a lot of anything between Ipswich and the range.) Is there really a clear divide between the coasts and Brisbane, outside of politics and the ALP wall?
32. Best of luck with it mate. I‚Äôm sorry the current economy is making it tough for you and your family. Hang in there and it will get better! I hope you find your forever home soon.
33. I guess my comment wasn‚Äôt sarcastic enough lmao. But yeah it‚Äôs so easy to make more money. Just uhh‚Ä¶ become a politician
34. And do what? Die? As I said above, sell in a high market, buy in a high market.
35. Then stop making these arguments which just re-enforce the market. There are so many of us who just want a roof.
36. The era made brisbane not a destination lifestyle choice. Hence, house prices were lower. It's a factor.
37. You save for the deposit. Which would be 40K difference assuming 10%. Few would be buying outright. 40k in 3 years for a dual income of 300k is achievable
38. Just bought after going through the exact same experience for 18 months. Now hearing ‚Äúyou got the house that was meant for you‚Äù is making me wanna rip my ears off. I‚Äôd have happily had any one of the other 12 houses I tried to buy. There‚Äôs nothing magical and mystical about this completely desperate process, lmao.
39. Ah damn, I'm sorry that happened to you. I really hope you can get everything back on track Also happy cake day
40. If they were really wanted suburban village feeling and hated city they would sell or rent out and move out regional or to a retirement village. You can‚Äôt have rural like towns and be 5 min from CBD. It‚Äôs just pure greed, their PPOR is their biggest source of wealth and is tax free. That‚Äôs why they hold to big land they don‚Äôt need and don‚Äôt downsize either as they know the tax free growth on their PPOR outperforms every investment and career in Australia by a lot
41. >I hope you find your forever home soon. I feel like our "forever home" societal mentality is holding us back. I'm not saying that it's our fault but things like stamp duty on purchase and how much places are people are only looking for a "forever home" when sometimes a home for now would be a better option
42. Well the point in your scenario is imagine the exact same house. Couple a buy in 2021 for 600k with a 40k deposit, so a 540k mortgage. Couple b buy exact same house with a 40k deposit, have 960k mortgage. You ahh still have to pay the mortgage off, plus interest. Think the point is rapidly rising house prices make you poorer because well you have to spend more money on the house!
43. Look at West End. People are literally trying to have that feeling and be 5 minutes from the CBD. "Stories not storeys* Sorry, reality is showing up.your narrative.
44. I agree. I honestly just meant hope they find a place to live they can call home soon.
45. Just bought an apartment for $975k. First home, buying it to live in. Not eligible for first home stamp duty discount because it's over $750k. Has the government *seen* what $750k gets when the median is nearly $1m?
46. And live where? I‚Äôd much rather own my house outright. Perhaps if I was to downsize, but that‚Äôs the joke: average people can‚Äôt afford anything substantial that you could downsize from now anyway.
47. Your understanding of the issue is....... limited. Go and read some more.
48. Never let the truth get in the way of opinion!
49. Congrats on your purchase. What does a $975k apartment look like in Brisbane in 2024? We bought our first home aged 41 which was a 3 bed 2 bath unit at Annerley at end of 2022 for $545k. The stamp duty discount stopped at $550k in 2023. We saved a few hundred dollars in stamp duty lol. We had no help at all from relatives or govt etc (besides the meagre concession above). We even offered $25k less than their ‚Äúasking over‚Äù price and they accepted. It‚Äôs a 140sqm older unit in a block of 5 with 22% body corp share. We added an extra room in the open plan dining area, and use our 40sqm terrace as outside (under cover) dining room. So we have now have 4 beds 2 bathrooms which is good as we have 3 teenagers. We spent about $50k on a reno (most work done by ourselves) and it looks nice now, it was rented for 20ish years and had original paint (pink and blue walls) and carpets, kitchen, blinds etc. Our terrace is awesome though, my fave space in our unit https://preview.redd.it/t5pmpyv2eoxd1.jpeg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e5bd77717cf3d6fa339d56ede1a401c75e27060
50. You'd, in theory, downsize and have quite a bit leftover
51. You guys have done so well, and I'm genuinely glad you managed to get into the market before it really went batshit. You've done such a good job on the terrace, too... It's hard to make units feel "homey" but that terrace looks amazing! A $975k apartment in 2024 looks a lot like a $500k apartment in 2015. 3bath 2bath 2car in 4000 postcode (but literally on the boundary. Next building down is a different postcode). $6.5k strata/yr which I was pleasantly surprised by. The market is absolute madness and I think it's only going to get worse... I went to at least 6 open home a weekend for nearly 12 months. was trying to get a house because Ive been caring for mum since 2022 (terminally ill) and I'm moving dad in soon as he's in early stages of Alzheimer's. A bit more space would have been nice and dad loves gardening, but even offering above (~12%) the price guide, I couldn't get anything. Hell, even getting my apartment was luck. Missed out on another one in the complex, PM said he had another one coming up. Gave him a formal offer with 30 day settlement on the spot, ownets accepted because they're retirees in their 80s and I just saved them the drama of advetising with an offer 25k above what they were looking for. Unless you're absolutely loaded, it's really just luck. If I hadn't been in the right place at the right time for this apartment, I'd still be looking today. Edit: I mean quite literally the apartment I paid ~1m for in 2024 was sold in 2015 for 500k
52. Which is obviously not happening given the prevalence of empty nesters. There‚Äôs not enough incentive to downsize when the only hope of many boomers kids and grandkids in owning property is for them to inherit theirs. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle
53. I think this is one of the problems with the PPOR not being included in the pension assets test. If you downsize your home, all of a sudden you have extra money, but you might lose the pension. This might change in the long term as more people have high super balances so don‚Äôt get the pension anyway, but at the moment it still might be a hindrance.
54. I think when people are decisive and firm in their belief, they vote early. Happened with the referendum too.
55. My dad *wanted* to change his vote after hearing about the abortion debate. Hasn't been thrilled with LNP in recent years but will probably never vote Labor, so he votes One Nation etc instead üòµ‚Äçüí´
56. Fellow data nerd with an interest in elections. This election has some amazing data to go through. Fantastic procrastination fuel lol!
57. There are some historical precedents theorised, as well as a more recent one. On the historical side, older and more rural voters are likelier to cast their votes by mail or early voting. These voters are typically more conservative, and from my rough memory Anthony Green usually seems to expect a +1% swing (though mostly concentrated in particular seats) to LNP once these mail and early votes get counted. On the recent side, it is theorised that most people had made their mind up in this election long ago. You ask about people changing their minds though I imagine it is really only the discussion on abortion that prompted any sort of re-consideration. Considering the abortion debate was brought up a while before early voting started I would assume that most early voters had already factored it in.
58. Voted early coz didn‚Äôt want to deal with crowds and bring some germs home to a newborn.
59. No, but by the time I received the postal voting form and found someone to sign it, it was only a few days beforehand. (That's later than I usually vote.)
60. I did not think of changing my mind in relation to the number I put against LNP
61. Not true. I voted at 5.55pm Saturday ...and I never gave another part another thought.
62. I think that's one of the things that aren't mentioned too much in these sorts of conversations. Most people who will change their vote are more likely to change from left to left or right to right. The number who change their vote from LNP to Labor or vice versa would be much smaller.
63. Some quite weird data if you ask me... Labor was not the culprit the voting made out.
64. It's quite interesting when you start to look into it by booth table and seeing how many postal votes vs phone vs in person.
65. Yeah, I can see from your historical comments why you are a Lib voter. Stay there.
66. I‚Äôm not saying everyone for gods sake. I didn‚Äôt vote early either, what I‚Äôm saying is that people that have no idea who to vote for, don‚Äôt generally run off to cast their vote early.
67. Aaaawww, poor leftard lost an election. Cry me a river.
68. It gave that impression. Don't lose the plot over it.
69. Correct. I didn‚Äôt say aussiechickadee65. I said people. Because that is what a lot of people do. Obviously not you, or me, but a lot of people.
70. It's better than 10-20 yrs ago for sure, I wouldn't exactly be jumping for joy living there but the reputation is a little overblown, that said have a good look at your immediate neighbours and the particular street.
71. I grew up in one of the equally 'bad' neighbouring suburbs in the 80s and 90s and my mum still lives there. If you've only known nice middle class suburbs, you're going to hate it. If you grew up somewhere a bit rough around the edges and can find a nice pocket (probably not around Smith Rd), you could make it work. Would I live there again? No. Do I have anything truly bad to say about the place? Also no. Plus the sense of community is 1000x stronger than anything my current nice middle class suburb has.
72. We purchased our first home there nearly 20 years ago. We lived in it for a few years then rented it out. We had it for 10 years and it didn‚Äôt increase in value in that time. Other than that, we avoided going out after dark if we could. As in, walking around. We did walk home from the train station a couple of times and it was fine but we didn‚Äôt make a habit of it. I think if you just keep to yourself you should be ok. Having said all that, as a woman I wouldn‚Äôt have lived there by myself. But I lived with my husband so I felt safe.
73. I grew up nearby and my family emigrated decades before. I still have family there. Woodridge is a *massive* suburb, literally. YMMV and it really does depend on the street. Buy further back from the train line and shops /centrelink if you don't need to be right near; look around on the weekend and see who looks after their yard and cars, get a sense of the place. You can also look up addresses on the Qld crime map and see on the heat map when there was last an incident. Kingston, Marsden, same advice. Go have a look around during the weekends when people are home and really get a sense of where is appropriate for you. You may have to get new screens, some cameras, it really depends on the house itself.
74. Lived in Logan for 4 years (and one of the better suburbs too), it has a stigma associated with it and it‚Äôs for a reason. Couldn‚Äôt wait to get out of there. The shopping centres there reek of BO too
75. If you can, try and find something closer to Logan central/kingson/Slacks Creek borders - it‚Äôs fine though. Always look at the street itself, there‚Äôs good pockets in every suburb.
76. Defiance Road and anywhere around thrrr or the train station is not great
77. If your going to look at Woodridge, I would say, stick to the outskirts, and nothing near the train station or main shopping area and pub and things. Look for nice streets - it will be obvious.. go take a drive around and see what you think. There is definitely a strong sense of community there and very mixed ethnics.. there are also a lot of good people there. But alot of people on Centrelink, alot of drugs, and can't be on the streets at night. If your set on living there.. find the best street away from everything, have high fences, plenty of security and 2 large dogs.
78. It's probably the worst suburb in the state. I volunteered there with Orange Sky and I got chased down by a guy on ice and had to speed away in the van as I thought he was going to kill me. For the love of Jesus, please don't buy there.
79. You're better off just buying an apartment closer to the city
80. 17 years ago I wanted to buy but could only afford areas like durak and Woodridge, my boss at the time scoffed and said I shouldn‚Äôt, they were terrible areas and I should look at the gap (where he lived cause mummy owned multiple houses and helped him buy his place) Now I‚Äôm in my 40‚Äôs and honestly, I get mad as hell every time I think about it! I wish I had of ignored him, owning a house anywhere shouldn‚Äôt be looked down on! What a dream!! If you can do it, DO IT!! Would get security cameras/doorbell cameras, motion lights and real good locks though. Get fully insured too. Just be smart until you know the area well enough to judge what‚Äôs safe and what‚Äôs not. If you‚Äôre just a normal person, not uptight or snobby, you‚Äôll likely be just fine!
81. If that‚Äôs what you can afford, the best time to buy land is yesterday. I imagine a lot of FHB are in your shoes looking at areas like this and as more owner occupiers move in the area will improve. Millennials and gen Z are a massive demographic that are looking to buy their first homes from now for the next 15 years at least, so I‚Äôm predicting demand for anything urban and affordable (I‚Äôm using that term relatively) is only going to go up. If it‚Äôs an investment you plan to live in, freehold is almost always going to give you both a better return and a better lifestyle (if you‚Äôre a family) than strata. Plenty of people will disagree with me and promote apartment living but the Aussie dream has always been house and land and while I agree that will need to change eventually, it is always going to be something that families aspire to and it won‚Äôt change in the lifetime of any adult alive today. Check that it doesn‚Äôt flood and get a good building and pest, then pay an extra couple of grand for a high fence and good quality security system + crimsafe. Then rest easy knowing you bought a solid investment early, instead of waiting to save for ‚Äòsomething better‚Äô and getting priced out.
82. When I started uni I moved into a set of units near the train station. The day I moved in there was a murder at the top of the street. I only lasted 6 months before I had to get out of that shit hole.
83. Can't speak to the accuracy of this site as I just found it doing a quick search on google but it makes for interesting reading. [https://redsuburbs.com.au/states/qld/](https://redsuburbs.com.au/states/qld/)
