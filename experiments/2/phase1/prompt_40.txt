Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. The liberals rely on people misunderstanding how the world works and essentially being conned into voting for things that will make life worse for them. A lot of the problems in society are complex, and require complex solutions, and it's much harder to explain those to people and sell them on it than it is to cultivate fear. to give you an example on crime - there isn't actually a crime problem. The total number of crimes has gone up because the population has gone up - more people means more of everything happening - but the crime rate - the number of crimes per capita - has actually gone down. but you can't explain that to someone that just got their house robbed because they've been personally harmed. The LNP exploits people's fear and desire to make themselves feel better about what's happened to them by promising all this tough on crime stuff - but tough on crime has never been an effective way of reducing crime - it's never worked anywhere in the world. In fact it's been proven to have the opposite effect - draconian laws makes crime worse. This is because the overwhelming majority of crime is inextricably linked to poverty and disadvantage. setting aside the tiny proportion of crime that is the result of evil people doing evil things, most crime is desperate people doing desperate things to survive, or people who feel so left out and hopeless that they turn to drugs and/or gangs, which in turn fuels a vicious cycle. For youth crime, it's been very conclusively proven that you have to intervene in young people's lives in a positive way - improve their home lives, give them positive stuff to do to and foster positive relationships through extracurricular programs, improve access to mental health services, make sure they can eat 3 good meals a day so they can actually learn in school, etc. The minute you send a kid to prison, you're basically guaranteeing that they'll become a hardened criminal; it absolutely needs to be a last resort. But doing all of those things is hard, slogans like 'adult crime adult time' are easy. on the economy, people fundamentally misunderstand how it works. A government budget is not like a family budget - governments exist in perpetuity, so they don't actually have a strict time limit to pay off debt. Debt isn't bad, the liberals just like to demonise it. When times are tough, you have to spend more to boost the economy - the debt actually results in a stronger economy and more money for the government in the long run. Then when things are booming, you ease back on spending to reduce your debt and prevent things from growing too fast which causes it's own problems. The political right, fundamentally, are crooks - their objective is to plunder society in order to enrich a very small proportion of people. they don't care about you - the left understands that to create a prosperous society, those with greater wealth have a duty to contribute more. This is why the liberals hate things like welfare, medicare, any sort of spending on stuff that doesn't benefit the wealthiest. In their world view, the poor don't deserve help. Except in the real world the economy actually needs a certain level of unemployment to fuction properly, so we have a duty to make sure the unemployed aren't living in poverty. When you reduce poverty, you make society better for everyone in the long run. The right will talk about trickle down - they say that by making rich people richer through lower taxes and fewer regulations, that wealth flows down to those below via more jobs and higher pay - except that's never been shown to be true. On Housing, again, they don't actually want house prices to come down, or build new houses to quickly, because skyrocketing rent and housing prices and the high cost of construction is making a very small proportion of people very wealthy at the expense of the community as a whole. then you've got the social conservative stuff - in recent decades the Liberals have been taken over by hardline religious fundamentalists who want to send the country back into the 1950s by stripping away hard won rights from women, gay people, etc. and finally there's the environmental stuff - the liberals are so taken over by vested interests in the mining industry that they have started to flat out ignore the scientific reality, and so they're actively trying to prevent the transition to renewable energy, greater environmental protections, etc. to them it's all about making sure their mates can make as much money as possible, and who cares what happens to everyone else. The right is also inherently authoritarian, and anti education, because fear and control, and a poorly educated population makes it easier to fool people into voting for them. The right is racist, because it's human nature to fear things that are different, and exploiting that gives them a convenient scapegoat to blame for people's problems to distract them from the real issues.
2. It's more so the history....it took years to recover from the last time LNP touched the top job. The track record and more specifically the track record of the leader does not fill the state with much confidence. Waiting to see how he goes and hopefully proves the haters wrong but the chances are low and won't be surprised if they sack the leader half way through the term just to try and save face for the next election
3. If you vote for people who's policies are fascist, and you agree with them, then maybe you're a fascist. Just like not all votes from the Nazis came from the Nazis, but they were fellow travellers...
4. Not withstanding that you just voted for a party that said it wants to take away the rights of women and take away medical privacy: You voted in fear. You think a tough on crime stance will help you because your neighbourhood has a bit of crime. Why not vote for a party that says it will decriminalise drugs (drive the price of drugs down reducing some of the reasons people commit break and enters), increase treatment programs for drug offenders and minors so they have a better chance at not reoffending, increase funding for children at risk ie free lunches, free transportation, employment and education schemes for children more third spaces to decrease the reason a lot of young people commit crimes. When I hear the slogan “adult time for adult crimes” i hear “I want to jail children and minors for being at risk and being raised in harmful environments. I want to jail children rather than deal with domestic violence, the cost of living, the rental crisis and an overloaded healthcare system that is struggling to treat mental illness and drug addiction.” If I know someone voted lnp i know they are heartless, classist and misogynistic.
5. You made your choice, Good for you. Let's see how you're going in 3 years time. PS. Nice use of all the anti ALP talking points. Terrific troll!
6. traditionally the Libs are the party that robs from the people to give to the extremely rich, which of course is a crime that makes crime worse. Worldwide countries like Australia are a mess because parties with such policies have privatised everything, white-anted public health and housing, and stopped taxing those super rich. Major wars are under way so that the globally super rich can take others’ cake (eg. Ukraine being sold to Blackrock and Beyer-Monsanto, Israel grabbing Syria’s and Gaza’s oil) and the Murdoch media want you to think selling the future to Adani is the answer.
7. Good on you for putting your post out there. Your experience resonates with me. Regardless of stats,there's been a lot of visible crime in my neighbourhood too. And yeah Miles was on the nose. To me it seems so odd that even though polling has shown, for a while now, that queenslanders were moving to the right, Miles essentially went left (50c fares, school lunches, higher royalties etc.). So instead of moving his policies to suit the appetite of QLD, he's essentially cannibalized the greens and left hoover in the votes.
8. I think the federal Labour Party made a few blunders during their term. Especially by trying to import American style “guilt” politics into Australia. The Yes/No vote probably being the apex of these. Their response to the “No” winning out just pissed the public off even more. On top of all that, they went down the road of Union bashing and putting the CMFEU into administration. The CMFEU also has roped a number of other unions to stand with them on their messaging, most adjacent construction unions like plumbers and ETU. But also others including teachers unions to bus unions. Whether you like or dislike unions , this is a huge factor. Their friends and family also would be influenced by this. Labour shot themselves in the foot. Their smugness lost them the state election. Who ever is handling their PR needs to be fired immediately.
9. Reddit is a left wing platform. Facebook is more right wing leaning. Always going to be pro left in this sub. I think Qld has a lot of “middle vote” (centre left/centre right) swinging voters. Only takes a couple of policies to swing them to the opposite of their last vote. You seem to have done the same, and it’s based on the anecdotal experience of how you are living currently. Crime doesn’t bother me even though our neighbours had their cars stolen a couple of weeks ago. I’ve lived overseas and it’s nothing compared to that here. Abortion is a women’s issue, even though I’m pro choice. I’m pissed off about the stadium. And I don’t want mining royalties reversed. I like the 50c fares. I like the school lunch idea. I don’t have kids or use PT. Hospital ramping needs to be fixed. I don’t understand why Labor has let it get this bad. I want to see more housing built. Anything. Just build it. It filters down and helps the bottom of the pool even if it’s classed as “luxury” by developers for marketing reasons. No, fkn Max Chandler wouldn’t allow that. I want to see the Bruce Highway upgraded properly for regions so they are safe. Tunnel built on the Northside to go under the Chermside and Aspley shitshow. We need more renewables. Not less. I understand miners have influence and they are concerned about jobs in regions with not many employment options. I get it. I’m a small business owner and capitalist at heart, but not at the expense of my fellow citizens. There are a lot of issues at play constantly, especially in a massive state with a 50/50 population split between inner city and regional areas. And a huge distance from top to bottom with different weather and climate and culture. It’s a very tough situation to navigate politically, and I think most people don’t fully grasp this fact. I would love Daylight Saving, but the bush won’t allow it politically, even if the vote would 100% win in a fkn landslide. It’s too risky. I think this sub generally leans to doing good for people. Which is interesting, as it’s anonymous. While Facebook is more right wing with some putrid discourse at times, by people happy to put their name to their disgusting comments. I don’t know how to explain that part. 🤷🏼‍♂️
10. There are two reasons. trauma from last time LNP was in power. QLD was in bad state last time (massive debt, huge amount of red and green tape) but Newman came in and did too much, too fast. Thinking he was invincible and he ignored the human cost of it all and was arrogant about it. His policies outside of mass sacking however were effective and labor reviewed them for a year and quietly implemented them. The fact remains they did cost a lot of people their jobs (including myself) The second is a lot of things are nuanced and people don't like that. So when the LNP start talking about policy that address that, people take it to the extreme. They don't like complex answers so they think LNP is being sneaky. Labor makes everything seem so easy, and black and white. It makes people feel comfortable. 50 cents fares are an example. Good idea but didn't do any background work like adding more trains, adding parking, get rid of crossing so you can run more trains. This mean that people have started giving up on it. Went from 14% increase of trips to to 4.5% but there was also more complaints per 10000 trips (up to date data on translink API) Or school lunches makes people feel good, but where the evidence it was needed. What percentage of children are actually going hungry, how do you do it for regional qld. why not more targetted programs first, and larger trials that started with regional qld. Renewable energy: seems simple to move everything to renewable, but electricity is hard to store, move, and balance. It needs to be mix of different options. These require a long term planning and cost/benefit analysis. If this get mention it's just LNP is anti-environment, anti-children There is a valid reason to vote for most parties depending on your situation but too many people in australia have started to treat political parties like football teams and become intolerant of the other side.
11. In general the LNP tend to align more with a smaller group of people than the ALP do. For example large companies vs the workers of those companies. More specifically, the LNP have been trying to import too much US style policy ideas. This is very much a "it's time for a change" result, than any ringing endorsement. Let's hope he can do better than his predecessor. Edit: I will say that crime overall is down, and that includes youth crime.
12. The fact that you voted LNP because loads of your neighbours have been broken into shows that you totally drank the Kool-aid on this one. What do you think is going to happen now - a big snow-plough is coming along to sweep them all up? All we're going to get is more hardened criminals. Sticking kids in jail is not going to solve anything.
13. In my eyes it's the LNPs passed policies that let cost of living get so out of hand. The last election favoured Labor but the problems were there already. Labor is much more across the middle in their policies and realise things like "youth crime" isn't going to be solved with harsher punishments, it needs to be rooted in social equity and social support. On top of that for me any party that gets so much money from special interests is never getting my vote.
14. >and the way the CFMEU has been allowed to drive up costs of building in this state, no confidence it wouldn’t bankrupt us. And I work harder than a CFMEU traffic controller for 65% of the daily rate Yeah mate, this isn't true at all
15. > So basically I took a balanced approach to this election, voted the way I wanted too, yet this place makes the type of person I am sound like a fascist. Why? No no no, not a fascist. An *idiot* If you are 28 or older, then either you have no fucking memory, or just like shit.
16. Miles was never going to last, he tried to buy his way giving freebies in the last few months, didn’t work, landslide lost
17. The purple haired lefty’s are gonna have a field day with this one
18. And social media wasn't such a big thing. These days, there are so many panicky posts from people complaining about teenagers walking down their street at night. When I was a teenager in the early 80's, we wandered the streets all night too. Just talking and smoking, and probably being too loud and disturbing the pearl clutchers. But it wasn't broadcast to the entire town. So between local FB groups and Murdoch media, it anecdotally sounds like youth crime is on the rise.
19. Back then, cross media ownership was limited.. but thanks to Mel turncoat..they can own the lot,.paper tv radio stations online
20. This. Anna needed to resign 12 months before she actually did. Basically she fucked the ALP by waiting until 10 months before the election. She can go kick rocks
21. That’s a fair point about you make about reacting to hardship and overemphasising that
22. I love how fucked our "Aussie spirit, she'll be right" attitude has snow cone to the point where this is potentially going to be policy. How did we get to the point that cookers are protesting 5Gand covidmeanwhile, this is the baseline now 🫠
23. Woman still have the rights to take the morning after pill if they're worried about being pregnant. Know the facts what they are against are woman wanting to have an abortion when they are actually babies with eyes, ears etc! ![gif](giphy|xT9DPJVjlYHwWsZRxm|downsized)
24. We had that exact conversation. I’m generally sceptical of the media and their propensity to inflame for the sake of it. I believed the LNP when they said they wouldn’t change it. If they go back on that, they’ll never get a vote for me again
25. On the other hand there’s plenty of women who don’t support this either. The argument mostly boils down to who get priority - the mother, or the baby who can’t defend itself. The latter choice isn’t *about* controlling the mother, although yes it has the impact of controlling or limiting her choices.
26. To add to this what's the point of being in budget if that means the public are suffering and things become even worse. You aren't going to fix cost of living by taking money out of the system.
27. Some would say that borrowing more money to inject into an economy suffering from inflation is not such a wise or effective move. Popular, sure.
28. If the LNP don't spend $10billion on ine railway line that helps a few people only in central Brisbane they will have money to spend everywhere to cover everything.
29. Hang on, the energy rebate was a once off and it cost $2.3 billion. The reg freeze was limited time too. They aren't getting axed
30. Will admit wasn’t impacted by Newman and can’t even remember much from back then. Can appreciate the scarring from those in the public service.
31. This. According to the Coorparoo Facebook group, it’s worse here than in South Central Los Angeles.
32. Because kids with their developed brains also weigh the consequences of their actions and make fair decisions based on it, specially when committing crime. Oh and our justice system is really affective at reforming everybody, with low recidivism rates. It's gonna be the golden ticket to safe neighbourhoods for suuuuure. I don't know how anyone with a shred of intelligence can look at youth crime and think that sentencing in the problem.
33. you forgot to mention UNIONS who walk slow thru construction and undermine it at every turn. Example of this is ETU/Energix not allowing developers using there own workers to hook up power to new developments and refusing to do so. Unless its there guys. just look at the RNA train station...
34. No one getting crime stats of facebook is gonna be able to personally weigh policy anyway.
35. Almost every one of my wife’s friends voted LNP. They are none of the things you mention in your last paragraph. But they are LNP voters. That’s just the way it is.
36. That’s a really poor reply to a good post. You’re better than that I’m sure.
37. Maybe pick one issue and talk about it. Start with the cfmeu one :)
38. So I’m not allowed to have my own emotions about not wanting to be broken into, and being able to think critically about pretty basic finance? You’re the troll.
39. You move from a fair point to fairly conspiracy focused very quickly there. Do you think Russia invaded Ukraine so that mostly American investors in black rock could buy up some of the pie? Also Isreal's invasion of Gaza isn't about oil....
40. I think some of the left policies were quite popular (50c fares, power rebates), just not enough to offset the popularity of the LNP going after youth crime.
41. I also like to remind people it was LABOR who sold most of the assets off.. but that get's lost. And when Labor took over newman Government. They were crooking about how there budget was so well balanced.
42. Well, you better hope they stick to their word. Not like they’ve been shown to bullshit before. Oh wait.
43. The loophole they gave themselves is if the KAP proposes it, the LNP can allow their party to vote with their conscience (not whipped) and given how much the LNP is against abortion, that will pass.
44. He already voted to keep abortion a crime last time. That sealed it for me already.
45. I would divorce my partner in that scenario, zero questions or remorse. Almost the entire party voted against bodily autonomy last time it came up in 2018. The party can say what it wants but it’s a conscience vote. Members have already shown their positions, most didn’t clarify how they’d vote today.
46. In [2018](https://amp.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/22/queensland-election-2024-lnp-abortion-policy-david-crisafulli) Crisafulli voted against legalising abortion. They may not introduce the bill but I can absolutely see them voting to criminalise abortion again. Do you really think they’ve changed their stance in the last six years?
47. So criminalising abortion is something you are against, but you still voted for the guy who said he would be fine bringing about abortion criminalisation?
48. After the fact is not as effective as before the fact. LNP & ALP are both going for conscience votes when KAP brings forward a private members bill; what are the numbers on both sides - or your own new representative? (Asking even though I haven't had s chance to do the maths myself yet) Edit: fixing autocorrect
49. You're gonna cop a lot of hate, but I think LNP would be stupid to touch it this term. All bets are off if they get in again though.
50. As a child that absolutely should have been aborted, I can say that any woman who wants an abortion for any reason should be able to have access to it. My mother was forced by catholic parents to marry the guy she got pregnant with. That 18 year old girl should never have been allowed to have children, let alone be forced to. My childhood was hell.
51. The problem though is if not in budget, while might make things better for the short term, eventually the long term situation is worse. Again, Victoria is the example there. I like the sensible cost of living stuff. Free lunches seemed a straight bribe. Appreciate there’s a % of people that can’t afford to feed their children properly. Spend the money to fix that - my kids don’t need free food so it’d be a waste of public money on them
52. Austerity has never worked. You need to inject money into an economy to get it moving again at times like these or else spending will stop as cost of living rises and you go into recession.
53. As someone who didn't even live in the state during that period of time and yet knew of how badly things were from both local friends and the likes of FriendlyJordies? It was fucked across the board and we may be in for worse cuts, worse abuses of power and the LNP basically trying to convince you they're doing a good job when in reality they're doing dogshit like usual. Just because you weren't impacted doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to see the warning signs from the past.
54. Rubbish......I live at the Gabba and went to Coorparoo high school in my youth. Seriously, nothing has changed other than easier access to illicit drugs. The difference is that social media is more accessible, every person has a camera in their phone and it's easier to spread the doom and gloom. The reality is that local problems and crime always existed, but weren't reported as widespread as they are today because we didn't have the modern tools, cameras, internet and Facebook that exist in society today.
55. Facebook can be a bit of a cesspool, it’s not a good place to get news. I don’t think I the offical stats tell the true story, a lot of crime just isn’t making into the stats any more because what’s the point in doing a formal report when it won’t make a difference.
56. If they voted for a party that wants to lengthen jail sentences for minors and a party that said it would consider putting abortion criminalisation back on the table then they are literally voting against their own interests. They are by definition misogynistic, classist and heartless. Women can be those things.

58. It's not really a good post. Very low effort of using talking points and crowing about backing a winner...
