Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. I'd like to know what these urgent and frighteningly expensive renovations are as well. It doesn't seem like it's going to just fall down.
2. Lol nah just start rolling the middle and see what you get.
3. It’s not though. It was built before current accessibility standards and needs significant investment to brought up to code.
4. As someone who works at the stadium as event support, the plumbing is egregious and the stadium is sub-par structurally all around. Check out a comment in this thread by u/[fissionxuiptz](https://www.reddit.com/user/fissionxuiptz/) that outlines the many issues.
5. Watch a game of AFL from the general admission seats. Then get back to me. Horrid experience.
6. Except that the new LNP review, should they stay true to their word will exclude Vic Park as an option. Also, there was only one review. So "every" review is an incorrect statement.
7. That’s probably the only two things the LNP have going for them. It will probably be a depressing four years for any other transit infrastructure though
8. I thought so at first too, but, I’ve never heard someone refer to that option as “Northside” before. I’ve heard northshore thrown up as an option once or twice, plus there’s room for restaurants (whereas, I’m not sure where you’d put them without taking more of the parkland at Vic Park). Keen to understand which they meant.
9. As someone who has lived in the Gabba area for the past 12 years and has seen things like the kangaroo hotel taking 10 years for them to tear it down and to start building (which at the moment they have stopped due to the unsure nature of the Gabba). And had a 8 story complex built one side of me and a current 23 story proposal trying to go forward on the right. Then the whole Stanley street area redevelopment plan (aka where the fires were only a couple of weeks ago) which only came about when the pda was introduced. And that’s only a few of the many examples of development interest only occurring due to the promise of the new Gabba. Why do you think the appartments on Stanley street got built. Because of the view into the Gabba. Which in the past would not have been allowed due to Gabba owning all the area and they didn’t want to have buildings high enough to see into the ground. But the Gabba ran out of money and they had to start giving ownership of the land over. Developers only care about mass profits and things that spike values up. The more you look into it. The more you see it. I’m all for more housing and the push for high density but developers are still in it for themselves.
10. IOC were never paying for a stand lol.. where the fuck do you even get this shit from. QSAC was the most expensive option because it had no transport solution, delivered no legacy benefit, and left Brisbane still needing to upgrade the Gabba which will be end of life by the 2030s, meaning Taxyapers are then paying for an upgrade of something they could have done for the Olympics.
11. It wasn't the archipelago designs. They clearly outlined deleting the driving range and function centre areas to build there. Also, none of their review was costed nor any feasibility studies completed. They just pulled the idea out of their ass and said it was best.
12. Sure, but it doesn't take a review or a genius to recognise that QSAC is a legitimately terrible idea.
13. Not really - you need the land, for a start. Secondly, why would you do it, instead of just going where the infrastructure already is?
14. What? Milton station literally links onto suncorp. You walk slightly up a hill and it's there.
15. I've been to plenty of broncos games which attract large crowds and I can tell you definitively that the idea that most people Commute there by bus or rideshare is absolutely and objectively wrong. The pedestrian traffic from both Milton and Roma Street stations is excellent.
16. It's because the proposal involves increasing the total site area by building over the ICB to link Spring Hill to Victoria Park. In the current Victoria Park masterplan there's something like 56 hectares of publicly accessible green open space, in the Brisbane Bold proposal by Archipelago there is over 60 hectares of publicly accessible green open space.
17. The Gabba will cost 100m per year up to the games to keep it running vaguely safely as per the Quirk report, then another billion afterwards to stop it falling down and providing decent emergency egress and disability access. That is $1.4b according to this article and more likely $1.8- 2b that has to be spent regardless, and even then, it will need to be replaced within a decade of the games anyway because it is rather buggered. There isn't really much choice in that, because the sport needs to be played somewhere ( it employs quite a few people if you didn't realise not to mention providing significant social benefits). Patching up the gabba, which is a pretty poor stadium to begin with, is rather dumb, and definitely a waste of money. QSAC is in the same boat, especially as using it for athletics will necessitate the gabba stupidity. So it is either a rebuild of the gabba or build a new one at Victoria Park. Doing nothing is not an option
18. > I mean we should give this guy a shot to see how he behaves. We know how he behaves. We've seen how he behaved during the campaign. We saw how he behaved and voted during Newman's government. He's not some obscure dude who happened to fall into the big boy chair. We know what kind of person he is. >Love or hate him, he’s here to stay, we’re under one team now, team Queensland. I'm all for Team QLD but Team QLD has just elected a divisive, religious, right-wing party. Forgive me for not being all sunshine and rainbows to people who want me to be a second-class citizen.
19. I mean, why not just put a world class stadium in your back yard? It won't fit? There's your answer about the Gabba.
20. Because the stadium doesn't fit there. And they'd need to build a temporary home for the lions & cricket which is dead money.
21. The site is within a PDA yeah. But I mean a PDA within a PDA if that makes sense. So EDQ become the developer. Like they did with Southport Hospital site.
22. Why? Wouldn't it be good for low income households with young kids to live on the same block as a state primary school?
23. Cheers, that makes alot of sense and thats a shit load of problems. I always wondered why they used basically fancy shade sails as coverage. Good luck new Gov sorting this issue. We'll end up paying for it but looking at that list knocking it down and rebuilding it is the only option, Olympics or not.
24. Please precisely quote the ways in the Gabba doesn’t meet current accessibility standards. Bonus points if you can find any legislation requiring accessibility requirements to be retroactively applied. If it isn’t up to current standards, shouldn’t it be closed right now?
25. The Quirk review and the project validation report is at least two..
26. There was a private consortium proposing a new stadium at Hamilton North shore, I think that was kiboshed recently. There would be to many planes going over the thing for one - is directly under one of the 4 main flight paths
27. Nonsense. Newstead is the same and no stadium there. It’s a community designated area.
28. Yeah I have seen the photo from the private slideshow where it's in the middle of the park, I just find it funny that it is never questioned and always misrepresented in the media. And the backwards justification for how Vic Park is the best option, fear mongering that the bus infrastructure to QSAC would cost hundreds of millions and cut down acres of trees. Ignoring the significant amounts of habitat that will be lost for the Shooting, Rowing and Whitewater facilities. And ignoring that there already exists a private council road that runs pretty much from the busway to the front entrance of the QSAC stadium.
29. So any part of Vic park is fine, doesn't need to face any scrutiny at all?
30. Plus the massive overpass from the rail side of the road to the stadium side that is explicitly for those rail-commuting crowds.
31. It's a reasonable walk from Roma St as well, for those coming from other lines.
32. Oh neat. Sorry couldn’t see that on the link you provided. Just got a map. Will have another look on a desktop.
33. Plus you should do it when you have federal funds committed
34. Even the Gabba itself doesn’t fit where it is located. Have you driven down Stanely St? I don’t understand how they plan to build a bigger stadium.
35. Funny how I told you that ages ago, and you were like nuh uh I worked on it. edit: lol blocking me me cause you're wrong, pathetic edit 2: This you *[–]shakeitup2017 Anyone who suggests QSAC as a viable option seriously damages their credibility. That is the dumbest possible option of all. It's even dumber than the proposal to temporarily relocate the Lions to Springfield. The Gabba is the right spot. They just need to agree on the scope and design. [–]Deanosity Yeah so dumb to suggest a site that can actually fit the facilities required [–]shakeitup2017 It's not about the site, it's about where it is in relation to where all the people will be staying and how they're going to get there and back [–]Deanosity Of course it is about the site, it's stupid to try and fit an athletics track between Stanley and Vulture, with no warm up facilities on site* And then like not even a month later, you were gobbling up what daddy Quirk told you to think
36. That’s false QSAC was $1.6billion funded by QLD, for a stadium with zero legacy benefit.
37. It doesn't need yet another independent review to choose Vic Park, or, as per my own preference, the Gabba.
38. Yeah, about like 15 hey - it's really easy to smash out
39. It may not be in there, I'm not too sure. But if you're interested, look for the "Roar Deal" Brisbane Lions podcast, episode 54. Fast forward to the 56 minute mark. They interview Peter and he gives a really good explanation of the proposal. Really worth a listen IMO. It basically sold me on the idea and I'm a sceptical and cynical engineer.
40. To be fair a lot of people flipped to Vic park once the full information became available. I know I did.
41. "If I could clarify, the IOC pays for the temporary seating. When there is a seating overlay, that is an expense of the IOC" - State Development Minister Grace
42. Temporary seating and stadium grand stands are not the same thing. To imply that IOC was to pay for 3 of the 4 sides of QSAC is disingenuous. QSAC was estimated as $1.6billion for the demolition and construction of the new podium level; including all ammenities, concourse infrastructure and DDA compliant requirements of the stands, not just the western stand as you implied. The entirety of this $1.6billion was to be funded by QLD taxpayers; the temporary seating, a entirely seperate figure and a yet to be finalised concept was uncosted had yet to be agreed upon with IOC either.
43. frankly, I don't really care. But more so, if Victoria Park were chosen, then choosing the site within Vic Park would take place following that.
44. If you don't know, just vote 'sure whatever, I don't want to ask any critical questions'
45. At some point, though, it's basically five minutes to midnight and you can't lock down all details in yet another Independent Review.
46. Elevated roadway is extremely expensive. It's not just construction - it's maintenance and safety.
47. Eww yuck, another free way. I also share you disappointment about lack of east west transport. Would love to see an east west busway (or orbital busway) please no more freeways, all they turn into is a money printing machine for transurban that doesn't reduce traffic.
48. There’s literally a tunnel already doing that, or at least half of it.
49. Brilliant idea. You should take that to BCC. The Northside is a fkn basket case. They need forward thinkers. Well done. 👍🏼
50. Yes that is correct, but instead of one lane, we elevate these lanes into a motorway so that the car infrastructure we do have creates a grid pattern. We can then fill surrounding streets with PT. Short of pulling up the roads and entire public transport network in brisbane, what we have now will never be sufficient or serve the purpose that is needed for commuting. .
51. He didn’t say that. It’s actually a brilliantly thought out concept and you have just shit on it with your fucking pea sized brain. Good one. 👍🏼
52. Everything is expensive and you pay a cost no matter which way you go.
53. It's not an either or its a both. Cars above and PT above. Both types of infrastructure are needed to create a successful city.
54. Completely agree, the north side is reliant on residential streets to transport traffic, it's an insane approach. By my reckoning cross town motorway at road road and one just past chermisde should do it. Literally from the range to the sea.
55. I can imagine transurban building the Rd, but not going to get the PT. Better yet, just invest in better busways and rails corridors or orbitals.
56. It's moronic. Road building has never led to decreased traffic congestion other than in the very short term.
57. Yeah but that's not a reason to just blow all your resources into an elevated highway.
58. Airport Link has an entrance on Stafford road/Gympie road intersection and you can get out at Sandgate Road or even after that.
59. Road building is the main way to solve increased traffic. FMD 🤦🏻‍♂️
60. Yeah I would suggest a reread of my post. The stafford road entrance is basically the city.
61. I don’t get the negative response in here, the Australian constitution doesn’t provide many rights but one it does is political communication. This is like the one thing you are constitutionally allowed to do so go out and do it.
62. I completely get this, but shouldn't a rally wait until they actually start drafting a bill? Otherwise I can see people considering this just fear mongering.
63. This is so important!! Highlighting that it will not stand is important before a bill gets tabled. The country will support QLD in getting this bill quashed. It's going to happen at some point during this term, I just hope the QLD LNP majorly stuffs up in the next 6 months. We need them to stuff up before the next Federal election, because Price has the same ideas for Australia, except she wants it banned after 12 weeks. If the LNP go well in QLD, the country will end up with Dutton. Just like we ended up with ScoMo because of QLD. Then women around the country will be stuffed. Edit: because I pressed post by accident.
64. Love this, and I will be there. What annoys me is that this took less then a week to organise and I've been hounding people to march against the cost of living and Housing crisis, and it's just crickets no one
65. I’ve never protested in my life, but I promise that for all the woman in my life I will be out there protesting every single time to stop this ❤️
66. To all the people saying “stop worrying the law won’t change” - if the law does change, will you be asking forgiveness from the people who raised warnings and concerns about it?
67. I hope this does not come across as scary as it might seem but it's highly likely that the lobbyist who was behind the 3 most recent anti-choice Bills around Australia (the Qld & Federal 'born alive' Bills and the SA's 'forced birth' Bill) will talk about this rally on her platforms and may even attend the rally to film herself harassing people. Prof. Joanna Howe from the University of Adelaide Law School is the main person behind each of these failed Bills. Howe is a expert in labour migration and does not have any experience in any medical-related field or human rights law. She started her 'Dr Joanna Howe' platform about 2/3 years ago and has been spreading healthcare and human rights disinformation aiming to (as she herself states on her website) "*make abortion unthinkable*". Howe has long worked with Women's Forum Australia and the Australian Christian Lobby and she has good friends in the media too via Gemma Jones, editor at the Advertiser, editor at The Australian and most hosts on Sky News. Howe herself is a conservative Catholic connected with the Disciplines of Jesus Covenant Community and Youth Mission Team Australia. [Here's a fact-check of some of her claims](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10cJfeDBIAYVZklthAT2blcZvcrXsP7lg/view) and I respond to some of her specific stuff [here](https://www.tiktok.com/@prgygrgy). Howe recently crashed a rally against her SA 'forced birth" Bill with her husband (also an influencer) where they filmed themselves accosting various women in the crowd, ignoring police directing them to leave, chased a Minister into the path of oncoming traffic and just some really nasty vitriol. After her Bill was defeated she has started targeting other academics and elected reps inciting violence against those (only women) who spoke against her Bill.
68. planning on going. first political rally for me since the pro-refugee rallies in the mid 1990s... you're never to old to stick up for whats right and proper...
69. I can’t wait for the over 70’s Nimby’s to not be the biggest voting pool by age. I bet most of them voted this lot in for the “adult time…” nonsense out of fear.
70. The irony on doing this on All Saints Day isn't lost.
71. Should have voted for … not them. Bit of a shut barn door after horse fucked off really.
72. The fact that we have to do this in 2024 is mind numbing
73. Cannot believe in this country we have to do this. I'm ashamed this is even an issue. Mind your own business .leave people alone for god sake
74. Going by some of the absolute disgusting comments in here, this is why we need to protest these things all the more. Keep the bastard politicians accountable. Edit: I'm going to add in this image for the special folks in the comments who are getting super butthurt, just to make them feel extra special. 😂 This isn't directed at you OP, just you let you know. Serves as a pretty simple litmus test really, and shows just how many shitty people we have in our community who find it "offensive" that women should have autonomy over their own bodies and health. This applies just as much to women's rights. https://preview.redd.it/uyjumkdamdxd1.jpeg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c1caba081d5337f85d3d24206621c5288f01455
75. Make no mistake, LNP are only against abortion because they want you giving birth to kids so they have more workers to replace. It was never about "Christian values"
76. Thanks for sharing. What pages should I follow to keep updated?
77. I was shocked and speechless when America banned abortion… and thought how lucky are we to live in Aus… and here we are, wow.
78. Let's not turn into a third-world country like Iraq. We are Australia we have choices || || ||
79. An incompatible with life pregnancy is devastating for a woman/family. You often find out half way or more through the pregnancy. An induced labour may result in a dead or still breathing foetus. Fuck off conservative men who think they have the moral high ground to get to tell me, a pregnant woman how I deal with that trauma being expelled from my body. It’s something you NEVER get over. I couldn’t let my child suffer inside me any longer.
80. Reading some of the comments here, I would like to point out a few things in regards to legislative/judicial process vis-a-vis US and Queensland. If I'm factually wrong, please clarify... Some US states' changed their abortion laws IN RESPONSE to a conservative court ruling Roe v Wade null, and abortion was not constitutionally protected in the eyes of the Supreme Court. The right to abortion was abandoned by an undemocratically assembled court, which allowed conservative states to pass anti-abortion legislation without a mandate, as the US Constitution does not explicitly protect abortion rights. However, Queensland HAS passed explicit legislation re abortion. The highest court in the state cannot criminalise it, they have to follow the letter of the law. The only way would be to enact opposing legislation. Now, the LNP would definitely be aware it does not have this mandate, judging on the public reaction to the rumours which circulated before the election. And I don't think MPs would be silly enough to risk their seat for what is essentially now a fringe issue. I'm not saying it's impossible that conservatives would try to repeal abortion laws, but it teeters on political suicide if they tried, in a state that has had so many years post Fitzgerald dominated by Labor. I'm not against the march. I am pro-choice and I'm happy people are exercising their right to protest and stay engaged in politics. But do so with cool heads - there is enough hyperbole in the fray without jumping to conclusions. The day the LNP outlaws abortion will be the day it lost the 2028 election.
81. It's typical hubris promoted by so called religious to disguise their moral vacuity.
82. Is there any more details about this rally? who is organising it and is it a walk through the city or just at the square?
83. i thought the poster on the right was an anti abortion poster for one second
84. There’s no changes going to happen to abortion and even if Katter’s bill got through then all it’s about is providing care to live late term babies born from abortion. What’s with the paranoia?
85. I thought the new premier said he wouldn't touch abortions or something
86. Someone clarify for me, is abortion all together what they are trying to ban or abortions after a certain amount of time into the pregnancy ? TIA
87. Fuck sale they actually elected the liberal government? Cringe Someone told me I’m an idiot for voting Labor, and told me “they did their research” and decided it’s better to vote liberal, I asked them if they could quote any specific policy reason they decided and they couldn’t tell me a single one….
88. Can someone clear this for me right. These people want abortion and then say due to birth rate decline we want more immigrants. Hmm I’m starting to see a trend here.
89. Friday 6pm in front of town hall. Better off middle of the day at 1 William Street where the state government offices are. Town hall is city council only
90. Isn’t there a Diwali thing all day on the 1st in King George square?
91. How many Aussie pro-life single issue voters are there to make some politician feel that this is a worthwhile wedge issue to instigate?
92. Too many people don’t understand that abortion would still be legal for those who NEED it, medical/rape etc. It should stay that way, that’s when women should have the choice. Allowing women to murder babies because of money, timing and the wrong partner is an atrocity and evil. If anyone else destroys that fetus from conception it is considered murder. Why should women be allowed?
93. I gotta love protests that occur literally days after a new government is elected, as if they’ve done anything yet and don’t have a fresh mandate.
94. What if sum one gets raped what if that girl doesn’t wanna have the baby
95. My body My choice is a pretty basic concept We learnt that during COVID no?
96. So not only are we telling lies now we’re making rallies to go with those lies. Fk you are deadshits
97. Sadly I don't finish work til 6.30pm, otherwise I would be there supporting my sisters. I get that nothing has changed though. Yet.
98. What part of "it's not in our plan to change it"" There will be no change" that you don't understand? Typical of the militant feminists getting their G strings in a knot over this issue. Move on!!!
99. Ah yes, because murdering Babies because you didn't take the proper precautions is definitely not evil at all.
100. I wish my body my choice was also Faught for when advocating vaccines.
101. I dunno how many times he said he would not change the legislation - so why fuck up traffic for everyone…..
102. Why? He’s openly said that the current laws won’t change. So abortion is still legal and there’s no plans to change that
103. I’m genuinely curious when people became so fucking stupid? The media and opposing political party are playing anyone who believes this shit like puppet. Honestly, grow a brain and stop believing all the fearing mongering bullshit.
104. Commenting so I can come back in a few years when nothing has changed and laugh at everyone here who fell for the scare tactics and fearmongering.
