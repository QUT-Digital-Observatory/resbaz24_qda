Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Deep state elite, the powers that be, ‘they’. Saw a good thread on it, they said they’re: (Paraphrasing) The corporate blob + military industrial complex + big banks = deep state elite The corporate blob being Blackrock, vanguard and state street. Blackrock owns over 80% of corporations in America alone, then there’s also the other two. All of blackrocks board members and subsidiaries own and are major shareholders of all of state street, and vanguard. Vice versa for vanguard owning blackrocks, SS’s, etc. They act as a homogenous blob. Owning all of media, medicine, military, agriculture etc. Given their ties and positions on boards like the WEF, UN, etc. their reach is global. On digital (video) record saying they want to lower population, most think through means of war etc. but it’s far more likely they’re trying to achieve their “agenda 2030” plans through destroying the nuclear family essentially. Divorces are up, marriages are down, relationships are down, hookup culture is up, birth rate subsequently dropping, to the point that which in a mere 2-3 generations we could (100-300 years) they could have achieved their population goal of 100m-500m. Regardless what we think of Elon musk, he is an enemy to the deep state elite. Corporate blob pulled their advertising from x for example and are launching an attack in the media on him. He advocates that we have a population crisis and need to have more kids, contrary to the DSE. This is not a conspiracy, this is a fact. That being said, Elon- despite his original predisposition against trump for example, has had to cozy up to him due to the regulation chokehold being put on him by the DSE, quite nearly destroying Tesla, space X for example. If he wants his company’s to survive, he needs to win over the establishment - sadly they aren’t even inviting him to the electric vehicle summits- tesla, they didn’t invite Tesla to the government summit for it. Insane and overt display of sides. Additionally, there are others who fit into this narrative, however some are being used as pawns. Essentially further creating this “red team vs blue team” debate among society; across the western world. In truth, musk isn’t good nor bad, trump isn’t good nor bad, neither is Kamala, or trans people, or cis people. People are people, and we vary on the spectrum of things. A lot of people, myself included hated trump for example. But when I asked myself for reasons, I couldn’t think of anything except article headlines. I couldn’t even name the specifics of this such strong feeling. I guarantee you, if you ask others, about trump, trans people, Jordan Peterson, anyone that is being used as figure heads of the red team blue team show- next to no one will be able to mention exact examples for their hate. It’s completely artificial; and I was shocked when I realised this. We are worthy of love and acceptance; however they have shrouded this undeniable goal with classist warfare, rich v poor, black vs white, racial warfare, battle of the sex’s - I.e women and men currently hate eachother the most now, than we have in entirety of history. With the rise of radicalised third and fourth wave feminism, had sown the roots of radical toxic masculinity, and men’s rights movements. This can be seen in things like the rise of Andrew Tate and dude bro culture. All in all it’s a multi pronged attack through the guise of collectivism via the Trojan horse of neoliberalism. What we were discussing may have been your area of expertise, but this is mine. It’s horrible, and spreading awareness on the fact that they are creating and perpetuating discord in the hopes of destroying the nuclear family, the self / individualism - is terrifyingly accurate and happening right as we speak. Another proponent for this move was to get the western world to not just accept, but WANT far right authoritarianism and the surveillance state. They ushered in radical third and fourth wave feminism inside the Trojan horse of neoliberalism, and have succeeded in pushing the left to the right, the right to the far right, and in essence - have frustrated the 90% of the population that don’t support these radicalised ideologies, to BEG for the surveillance state, to BEG for more control - even if it comes at the cost of less liberty. Churchill spoke of this, I believe it was Truman or Roosevelt who mentioned this exact method of how to transform the governing political ideology to such of more government control and right wing associations. The past few decades have been a drip feed of this, and we are seeing it come to its fruition now. We see this in Europe, in France, in Argentina; where far right wing parties are dominating the polls. We now see it making a resurgence in America, and with Dutton - the LNP here in Aus too. In order to stop this, we must work together. We must remember what we have lost, love for one another. Regardless of your creed, sexual orientation, sex, race, social status- I LOVE YOU. And I hope we can make it out stronger, and more importantly; together. ❤️
2. Ooft. Blaming the victim for the crime is a bold move. Real "well she shouldn't have dressed so provocatively" vibes. It's not really a fanfic anyway - it was just a loose recollection of what happened in my suburb a month ago. The difference is that Steve actually went and shot BraeDon in the shoulder with a nail gun to get his belongings back, but I'm not sure vigilante justice is the answer for now so I omitted that bit. I'm not saying we shouldn't be locking up adults for adult crimes or that we should target youth crime. We should be doing both.
3. Mate I’ve been in it for 35 years, high rise construction and can tell you that I’ve been in town with 100 members while an organiser called Anna Bligh a cunt and a slut over a megaphone and told no one to vote for her, that was when they had it in for her. Every election we’ve had organisers tell us in no uncertain terms who to vote for.
4. You need to check your algorithm my dude. None of this is because of any deep state. The concerns might be real, but what you are being lead to believe is to blame is rabbit hole shite. If you watch the 2030 thing in context it doesn't say nor imply any of this. I too am in pretty deep in this lore, but on the other side because I've lost people to these kind of beliefs, or more so the cause of these issues.
5. Trump is a rapist. That's a good reason to hate someone.
6. I live in one of those youth crime hotspots. Every single day people are whining on the community page about having their things stolen and every single day they admit they left their shit unlocked. Weirdly, my shit (tools plus multiple luxury cars) doesn’t get stolen? I’m glad you lot decided sacrificing women’s lives is worth it because some guy said jailing kids will end theft. We’ll just have to ignore all the evidence telling us jailing kids doesn’t work because you people get your cocks hard for punishing those you deem lesser than yourselves. Again, call me when adult men are doing adult time for their adult crimes.
7. My apologies for any confusion, in truth I actually have completely forgot what agenda 2030 was about! I was using it moreso as an example of world agenda that the WEF for example leans towards. There are videos I’ve seen where certain high profile members are speaking about the population ‘issue’ (entirely bs tbh. We don’t have an overpopulation issue. Anyone with half an ounce of critical thinking knows that). And speaking on how lowering the birth rate could see the decline to their number in X amount of generations. No conspiracy there, in 4(1080p)k. Regardless the case, the message I am sharing is unity, and anti-division. I am spreading that the media is a massive propaganda firm and people are subscribing to it; so much so, to the extent that which they personally identify with red team or blue team. When I see these buzzwords like transphobic, maga trumper, lefty, (in derogatory term) feminist, etc. - it brings to light that these are modern terms coined by the industry that which delivers us news on top, 24/7 in the palm of our hands. Social media feeds have indoctrinated us to their church of lies, and we can’t get enough of it. All I wish to say to you is that I love you, and I hope the next time you hear or think of saying any of the above, or choosing a ‘side’; to spread the word and/or remember that there is an entire corporate apparatus that has split us in the first place- any hatred we have for eachother, however artificial; should be reserved for them. ❤️
8. I hope you can apply this thought process to our trans brothers and sisters and not allow the likes of Elon, and others politicise their existence for their personal gain. Best wishes 🙏
9. 100%! This goes to everyone! I have no room in my heart for hate, especially artificially constructed hate. Best wishes to you too my friend ❤️
10. I lived near a train station in an inner suburb of Brisbane 20 years ago and was broken into three times. Crime was much worse then, but Murdoch wasn’t as dangerous and didn’t influence elections so much then. I suggest that what you may feel is a balanced approach is in fact heavily influenced.
11. Why bother now? It's done. Should have asked this question a week ago. Youth crime and recidivism were down according to the recent QPS report, labour had already introduced some harsh policies many weren't fond of. The bed has been shit and we all have to lay in it now.
12. The election is over and the party with regressive and / or non existent policies won. You voted for that, as is your democratic right. You don't need to justify it, and people here don't need to make you feel better about your decision.
13. Going into this election, Labour's policies were very much "Yes, i understand this will cost us $10 now, but it will save us $100 later" LNPs policies were "We're not those guys". It sucks to hear that your local area has been broken into, but the ire that that Labour supporters have had with that approach is that it's kind of like; "Hey, i've personally experienced a hardship, the whole state needs to readjust" I think Miles was done dirty, only having 10 months to show the state what leadership under him looks like (and it was a good 10 months imo), but we'll now have 4 years to see what an LNP government will do for us. Fingers crossed i keep my job.
14. I think your question is very fair. I am a swinging voter. I swing at every election. I just look at the policies of the parties and the environment and vote accordingly. What I find difficult is having conversations with party faithfuls who would defend 'their' party no matter what. In my view, that's actually not very helpful and doesn't really address the issues of the day. It's pretty evident that there is no perfect party but I vote for the party that, on balance, can meet the challenges of the day.
15. If you ever live near a train station you will always get higher crime. Just how the younger kids get around.
16. Look your wife in the eye and tell her you just voted to potentially take away her right to choose what she does with her body.
17. Imo it's pretty simple, the cost of living relief that Labor brought was some of the best in the world. The energy rebate, the rego freeze, it's all going to get axed soon cause of course they won't be able to pay for it once they lower the mining royalties. This whole youth crime thing won't get solved by locking up kids, that's just going to make them criminals for life, you fix this shit by getting people out of poverty and bad situations, which things like the school lunches would help with. And on a personal note as a public sector worker, our entire unit still hasn't recovered from being crippled by the Newman government. The new privatization initiatives from the LNP will definitely make things worse for the public and leave alot of people out of work for no benefit. The LNP refusing to actually make a call on any policy is very concerning. Everywhere you look is scars from the last LNP government, and the new one certainly ain't goin' to make them better.
18. I'd say take a look at the last time they were in power around the time of Campbell Newman's reign in QLD, there was major cuts to public sectors and absurd levels of putting money into the wrong areas to the level it took Palaszczuk YEARS to undo it. The LNP wanted to fast-track the Adani Coal Mine in 2017's election and that basically made it clear they were willing to hedge their bets on the fossil fuel industry despite it slowly becoming more and more clear that it isn't needed for the long-term future, meanwhile Labor has been taxing the mining industry itself to allow for the Energy Rebates (both kinds of them) and the 50c fares as well as the lower rego fee's to combat cost of living. The fact they'd want to do a deal with One Nation in the past and now seems to wanna do business with Katter's party to ensure a crossbench in QLD if things seem like a minority government is being formed instead should tell you a clear red flag there alone. I don't think you're a bad person if you voted for LNP based on the Youth Crime stuff if it was affecting you in your neighborhood, I just think voting out Labor again after 9 years of things going on the up for the state just to be reminded of how bad the LNP truly are for the next four years due to one specific issue being pushed constantly on morning news shows for an entire year straight is not the way to go. I hope you see sense in four years and vote them out, but for now I hope you're able to live with the choice for focusing on one of many important issues, of which the one you focused on may have been more personal, but it was certainly the lesser important one long term
19. First of all you should stop being on those community Facebook groups
20. Idk might be wrong but it seems if you cared about policy you would have asked this pre election, not post. But if you really want an answer: The LNPs entire campaign was based on youth crime and I’m sorry to hear about your neighbourhood but statistically speaking, youth crime has been on a consistent decline for the last ten years. And let’s hypothetically say that youth crime was increasing, there is zero evidence to suggest that harsher mandatory sentencing laws will reduce youth crime AND lets go even further, even there WAS evidence that harsher sentencing reduced crime, the LNP can absolutely not overhaul QLDs sentencing legislation to make this happen any time soon. What actual is proven to reduce crime? Pulling people out of poverty, which was being addressed by the Miles government through free school lunches, 50c fares, subsidised rego, energy rebates, more bulk billing GPs… And actually yes we could afford this stuff because FINALLY one of our politicians had the balls to up the royalties on coal, which is what is paying for all this stuff btw. On the other side of the coin, the LNP will axe all of the above and instead plan to cut essential workers to save money. You can say farewell to any bulk billing GP btw. And like you say you have no faith in the Miles government to pull off the Olympics? The LNP hasn’t even GOT A PLAN! How does that possibly give you the faith they can pull it off? I am truly devastated by this election result but will always remember that I was on the right side of history.
21. No other state properly funded their budget by including a proper resource royalties structure. This is nothing like the Andrews govt that had nothing to work with in terms of infrastructure because the LNP sold it all. Qld taxpayers (individuals) under the ALP are not the only source of income. We can afford better of lots of many things. We sell high quality product resources) into a close market at rates that are amazing for the miners, but shit for the people of Qld. And here’s the thing. In Alaska (in the almighty capitalist USA) all citizens get money and services from oil royalties. The LNP have refused to do the same in the past and basically forgone taxing miners to any competitive level. They’re so full of shit about us not being able to afford it - what they mean is that the miners don’t want to pay taxes so that we can have better. L/NP philosophy is one of user pays. It’s a shame that their Christian beliefs in man sharing the bounties of the earth only works for multinationals and paid-for political policy. As a state we own much of the capability to serve the state without expensive, scalping, and proven unworkable privatisation. We have been in a better place than nearly every other state.
22. Definitely sound advice to get off facebook..Particularly those community pages. There is a QLD location based crime map you can google. It’s ran through QPS and the government. You can search your local area or your own address and it will show you the stats of actual recorded crime and breakdown by numbers the types of crime going on in that area across week’s, months and years.
23. If you think the “adult time for adult crimes” policy and the “war on drugs” is actually going to have any long term benefits and not eventually worsen the problem then I dunno what to tell you buddy.
24. CFMEU has little to do with the cost of most construction, lack of skilled workers is a big part 50c fares are paid out of the pocket of Mr adani
25. Lnp are opposed to pioneer-burdekin pumped hydro scheme. Something we need before 4.4GW of power stations eol by 2040. Decrease or mining royalties. I work in mining, no projects are on hold based on royalties in qld. So it's just giving money away for no benefit. Abortion. How tf is that even a topic. Pill testing is a good. It keeps people out if hospital which saves money. Increasing punishments for crimes are shown to not have a significant change in crime rates. So "adult crime, adult time" will have zero to negligible effect on rates, but cost more money to have them in prison longer and reduce any chance of them being contributory members of society in the future. Outside of that, there were no policies given by the LNP. So all announced policies were a negative, and the rest hidden.
26. Well, there are scores of developer blocks sitting still, my local MP told me a major development that's been anticipated for a decade is constantly held up by greedy developers shifting the goal posts. Then there's all the land banking and spite houses
27. Good question. My thoughts are it’s a combination of 1 there’s naturally fewer more conservative voters on reddit 2 the ones that are here stay silent, because they are outnumbered and also because- 3 the arguments used these days too often just write the other side off as dumb or fascist or evil or whatever instead of at least communicating without just shouting insults and trolls at each other. It’s easier to not listen and just shout at your phone screen, rather than seek to learn and see a different perspective even if you disagree with it. Being able to do this is some of the glue that holds democracies together.
28. Well I am the total opposite to you. Single income family always earned the equivalent of 2 normal wages, way above the average in bank and super savings, own my house outright, lived within my means and always voted LNP. For the very 1st time I voted Labor, because I feel Steven Miles offered the better alternative and had great initiatives to help Qldrs suffering from the current cost of living crisis, high cost of housing and rents. I believe crime figures are not any different than they were in the past. The only difference is the advances in communication and social media make it appear that it's a bigger issue and out of control. The 50c bus fares, the freeze of car rego, kids school lunches and $1000 help with electricity costs, whilst it wont make much difference to my family status with both my kids grown up and having their own careers, I know it will make a hell of difference to lots of families. My oldest son is a high school Maths and Business teacher and tells me the daily challenges on the school grounds with some kids not having food or accommodation in their everyday life and teachers having to help them in that respect. A life of crime to survive is the only choice for some of those students. It's unfortunate, but reality. Throwing kids in jail is not the answer to stop the crime to survive to manifest itself on society.
