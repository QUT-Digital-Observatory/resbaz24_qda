Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. I don’t think the LNP is advocating removing royalties - they were talking about rolling back the most recent changes made a couple of years back which brought in a top 40% rate. Based on the current coal price, this rate is a long way from Kicking in.
2. LNP will solve the teacher shortage by making classes bigger. Sounds like a great idea. How will the solve the police and nurse shortage?
3. I do get a laugh that the Qld branch head & Ipswich West candidate for the Libertarian Party of Qld is so dedicated to people 'making their own choices' that his whole career has been devoted to influencing people's choices as a business marketer "*developing impactful digital and traditional strategies to drive customer engagement and sales outcomes*"; currently owns his own marketing company; and, prior to that, was a senior marketing manager for one of those dodgy 'classic car lottery' trade-promotions-masquerading-as-a-charity that's currently under investigation in NSW...
4. I 100% agree. I know some great ones also. The grass roots members. The everyday blokes that are not radicalised. Iv been in 3 EBA in my life. The ones at the top are as rotten as they come. Only care about increasing the number of union “tickets” they have. All three times they traded out great benefits for workers to increase things for the union. I also know a lot of business owners, who are fantastic bosses and employers who the unions have come and railed. They get one disgruntled staff. Unions get a seat with one or two members and it destroys them. You are right what the unions did. I think 20-30 years ago they had a place. They still do have a place to keep the status quo. But they keep pushing. Nothing is enough. Housing crises is a supply issue. Who causes that. Landlords get the hate. Immigrants. We need more skilled immigrants. Especially in the construction industry. Unions blocked that. They are a business and need to grow their fee intake. I could write the same about the bad iv seen big business do also. Don’t get me wrong. I’m just giving you the other side to your stance. I don’t need to tell you about their evil doings by the sound of your position.
5. Trump economy was the best in decades, that period of time from 2016 until covid fked everything was amazing, tf are you on about lmao
6. I would welcome larger classes if it means like last time we had LNP government, teachers got more conditions and more pay. Unlike the last 6 years where we got a pay freeze, more work added, and now have 19 year olds who haven't passed a single year of a uni course teaching students unsupervised. we honestly can't get worst. Even if it does atleast we tried something different.
7. Sounds pretty sketchy, I'm a libertarian idealistically. Not necessarily a supporter of the party I found out existed in the above comment two hours ago.
8. So his policies that screwed everything up after he left aren’t his fault and the policies that led to the gains in his term term came from the previous term are his? Come on man, things looked good in the start of his term were all from the previous presidential decisions
9. Hey man, Trump is only 3 years younger than Biden.
10. 19 year olds who haven't completed a year of uni teaching unsupervised? Can you elaborate on that
11. Don’t even bother, account is 8 hours old. Probably disasterdecks latest alt account. Resident troll of Australian subreddits.
12. so under permission to teach program (PTT) if schools can prove they can't find a teacher they can hire someone who meets the PTT standards. Which is basically that they are making progress in education course (masters, or degree in education) or have other relevant work experience. https://www.qct.edu.au/registration/other-approval-permission-to-teach these PTT are suppose to be given extra spares and mentoring but take classes alone. I currently have one who teaches next to me, who started in term 3 after completing their first semester of an education degree. So they are teaching 3 classes, and still completing uni and still have to take time off to go do their uni pracs (not suppose to/aren't allowed to do it in the school you teach)
13. I've just read on there that to be approved for a PTT you must "meet all requirements of their accredited program to graduate from the program. Requirements include but are not limited to: - successful completion of the final PEx; and successful completion of a teaching performance assessment". How can this possibly be done after one semester at uni? Are you in a rural area or near the CBD?
14. near the cbd, that part of the requirement is basically saying the schools must ensure they give them time off and make sure they are making progress. As long as they are enrolled in teaching program they can get PTT qualifications(see quote from pst pdf). we currently have 6 at my school. 2 that are young first years, 3 more in their final year and 1 who is from the trades which is what ptt was suppose to be about. >• Employment of a PST under PTT is informed by an understanding of their knowledge and experience, capability and capacity and progression through an initial teacher education program. • Consideration is given to employment and study workloads that allow PSTs to be successful both in their work and their study. we used to have intern system, where schools could hire teachers once they finished the final prac but before they were offically registered. They changed alot of rules a few years back after covid to make ptt more accessible.
15. He is smashing the bongs. Let him get a couple more in before he responds again.
16. My partner is a teacher. That is not what is happening
17. Council could start by reprogramming traffic lights to ensure that pedestrians don't get conflicting vehicle movements. In Brisbane (at least) they love giving pedestrians a green light at the same time as giving turning cars a green light to drive through the pedestrian crossing. We simply don't do this for other cars. Imagine simultaneously giving a green light to cars travelling in two conflicting directions! Any reasonable person would tell you that it's simply impossible for that to happen, it's so dangerous and nobody would ever be that dumb. But with pedestrians, it's cool. Give them a green light at the same time as a car is given a green light to blow through the crossing. That doesn't seem laughably impossible. In fact it happens at so many intersections that it seems mundane and normal. If we must have traffic lights, then the pedestrian movements should be given the same priority as vehicle movements. That is, when the pedestrian crossing has a green light, every car wanting to drive through the pedestrian crossing should have a red light. It's not rocket science.
18. Better yet, increase the time that the red arrow is actually lit up. It's useless if it's on for 5 seconds when it takes 15 to cross the entire intersection - people seem to forget that pedestrians are crossing both away \*and\* toward the traffic that's turning left.
19. I moved to Brisbane from Melbourne. I love Brisbane, but I've been stunned by how inhospitable it is to pedestrians and cyclists, and how few safe crossing areas there are, even near schools.
20. Well you see, the council has been busy wasting money on the metro so of course there's no money for pedestrian safety. Poor excuse of a council can't believe they've been in for 2 decades.
21. I'm keen to understand why BCC is so committed to ensuring that our city such a pedestrian unfriendly environment.
22. >MacKenzie referred to comments made by a Brisbane City Council planning manager, who told the court all governments were constrained by budgets. >“I agree with this observation, but we are dealing with human lives,” MacKenzie said. Brisbane being the largest LGA in Australia is clearly too much for these Councillors to handle. If they don't have enough budget to address their own issues, perhaps they should organise a competition or auction off a couple of [BCC Wards](https://www.ecq.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0021/6492/Brisbane-Existing-Boundaries_Overview.pdf) to neighbouring Councils that are keen to absorb and manage these areas appropriately and safely for the constituents. https://preview.redd.it/wjsgvcks8nwd1.png?width=1686&format=png&auto=webp&s=81fdc42bb477df0415df46da201cb190fa3ec43a [Source](https://www.ecq.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0021/6492/Brisbane-Existing-Boundaries_Overview.pdf) Contests for Wards could be: * Redlands and Logan for Chandler Ward * Moreton Bay, Somerset & Ipswich for Pullenvale Ward * Ipswich and Logan for Jamboree & Forest Lake Wards Obviously just chatting shit, but what else can BCC do aside from cry poor whilst spending billions of dollars putting wheelcovers on buses.
23. I dont have brisbane times access. did they detail how much protected arrows would cost the entire network? I'd be surprised if we got change from 100 million.
24. Well it’s true, there is a limited budget. I would like every single street to have a dedicated separated bike lane but that is not financially possible. It’s already a road rule to give way to pedestrians - what makes them think people wouldn’t ignore the red arrow just like they ignore existing road rules.
25. Is there any evidence this will actually stop the morons who threaten pedestrian safety? Or is it really just going to slow down those who follow the rules?
26. Cars still have to give way to pedestrians. Programming can be an issue, but there are so many shitty drivers out there. If possible, underpasses for pedestrians or over passes or change the flow. Walking down a normal street I have seen cars speed down like crazy. Street design needs to be reassessed. However, without funding and development it wont happen.
27. Yes! I regularly get honked while completing my crossing because the red turn arrow turns off and cars seem to think I should run to complete my crossing.
28. They did not detail that. It seems like a small sum of money compared to the congestion busting budgets.
29. Yep. But when a roundabout in Indooroopilly goes $200m over budget, council can't get the credit card out fast enough..
30. I do think that some greater education on this particular rule should be a priority of the state government. Barely anyone knows that cars have to give way to pedestrians crossing if you are turning onto a street regardless.
31. I think it's the blatancy that would reduce at least the number of instances. That being said; I see soccer mum vans speed through school zones - that one gets me the most.
32. You don't have to run, but if you dawdle, well I won't honk you but I will call you every name imaginable, and put a curse on all your descendants.
33. Indooroopilly round, omfg, all we are going to do is push the traffic quicker to the next intersection. Should of just built some bike and walking paths and called it a day.
34. Yep. Has cost 220% of the original budget, and isn't finished yet. No trouble finding a quarter of a billion dollars to cover these blow outs though..
35. The underpass at Kessels Rd & Mains Rd in MacGregor cost something like $300M and disrupted all the businesses for a very long time while under construction. All it did is move the congestion to the city bound freeway onramp slightly faster, outbound traffic down to Sunnybank plaza intersection and down the road to the Logan Rd intersection at Westfield Garden City. I think the argument though is that it's now 3 choke points instead of 1 chokepoint.
36. - what I mean sorry. If it were an actual red arrow or in some places like Dutton park - a flashing amber arrow it creates a legal need to justify the action of running it rather than "I didn't see them"
37. The kinds of bike lanes that are just paint and a bit of concrete arent actually an improvement.
38. I'll remember that when I'm crossing the road with my three year old.
39. The rorting on that project was fucking eye watering, absolute shit show.
40. There is endless money to "congestion bust" which is just another term for induced demand. There were existing perfectly good roads at Indooroopilly. The problem is planning for 80% of journeys to be made by car, including the walkable distances.
41. I'll also make sure to tell every person using a cane or walker to remember that. 🤣
42. It's being rolled out one operator at a time. Currently all Sunshine Coast bus operators and most Moreton Bay bus operators are online. Not sure which operators are next. I guess they switch on each operator all at once because that makes it easier for the operator to manage their fleet. And I suppose they are doing one operator at a time because that given them time to identify and fix bugs at a manageable rate.
43. Well the software has been fixed/created and is now being rolled out. They're starting with small operators and will slowly roll out to larger operators over the next few months. TfB will probably be the last operator, but subject to no teething issues will likely have the software update by the end of the year. Remember it wasn't just turning the software on, it was developing the software because for some reason cubic couldn't roll out software and hardware together, and buses use a somewhat different backend to the trains
44. Honestly I find it hard to believe the implementation is that difficult. The vehicles must already be location aware and networked due to the ability to charge your go card swipe on/off appropriately. Isn’t it just a case of having NFC capable swipe points?
45. It'll be way more involved than that. The old system was a fully offline system, where your account was actually stored on your gocard. Each time you touched the reader, your account was copied off your gocard onto the reader, which updated the account and then copied it back to your card. Details of the transactions were then stored on the reader until they could be downloaded (originally once a day via wifi). Translink would go through these records and identify any transactions that needed further processing (like credit card payments). These transactions could then be sent back to the readers (via wifi) and uploaded to your account next time you touched your card to the reader. When you went online, you weren't looking at your actual translink account per se, but a reconstruction of it based on Translink records. That's also why top ups through a gocard machine were instant (because the machine can actually interact with your actual account that is on the gocard), but topping up online took 24hours before you could use it (because the transaction needed to be uploaded to the readers overnight and then copied onto the gocard where your actual account was stored the next time you touched on). The new system is more like what you'd expect, the card is simply a token that identifies you when you touch on/off, but all the rest of the processing happens on the back end. It's a fundamentally different system and it has almost nothing in common with the old system.
46. That cannot be true because trips are immediately visible on your account. I know because I recently checked. They were visible while I was on the bus. Is this an informed opinion, because I find it very hard to believe trip info is stored on the card and read/write cycles occur. The tap is just an unique ID - all of the info is stored in the system and in my experience synced to online trip history virtually instantly.
47. The system is built so it can operate offline. These days with the better mobile network it doesn't typically operate offline. But that's the way it currently works. That's why it's actually your go card that stores your balance, your very recent travel history and tell the reader that so it can't charge you appropriately. You'll find some buses aren't connected for various reasons and these fares won't show up on your account until the bus returns to it's depot and uploads the data to network.
48. Was that on the new readers? The new system is an online system and you may have noticed the behaviour of the go card changing as they roll out the various features. With the old readers, journeys didn't originallt appear online until 24 hours later. Even a couple of years ago, just as the old readers were being withdrawn, a touch on the old reader wouldn't show up online for up to two hours.
49. Yes it can store taps offline when data is not live and sync later, but that is not the default mode of operation these days and hasn't been for a long time afaik. I find the claim that the card is storing data very hard to believe. I find the claim that the card is written by a tap even harder to believe. In fairness, I could be wrong.
50. Honestly I don't know. That still doesn't mean balances are stored on the card. I'm trying to find technical info now. I see you posted this 6mo ago that it does store the data on the card. [https://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/1c6m716/comment/l02o5lg/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/1c6m716/comment/l02o5lg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) That seems like a daft way of doing it. Why wouldn't it just register a unique ID against your account and store all transactions on Translink servers? Seems unnecessarily complicated.
51. There is plenty of evidence: Have you ever wondered why it takes 3 hours for a top-up to come through? It takes time for all the buses to be sent that data and have the ability to write it your card. That's why a fare machine can do it instantly, but you need to tap your card after payment so the new balance can be written. The actual specific card is this: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIFARE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIFARE) They cheaped out and bought the 1kB version, which is why are fare structure is so restrictive as the cards can't store enough data like more expensive cards. So don't believe me if you want. But Translink and Cubic know how the system works and are developing it accordingly no matter how much it frustrates or may seem stupid to you.
52. > I find the claim that the card is storing data very hard to believe. I find the claim that the card is written by a tap even harder to believe. In fairness, I could be wrong. It is. There's an app called metrodroid which can read the data off a gocard if you get the encryption key (which is trivial with the right equipment). It can show you all recent trips as well the last few topups, current balance, whether the card is touched on or not, etc.
53. You gotta remember that the gocard is based on the original Oyster Card in London. This system was designed in 1998/1999. The most primitive form of mobile internet had only appeared as a commercial product a year or two before, and it was incredibly expensive (billed by the kB), and about 20,000 times slower than modern mobile internet. The issue is, if you want to do things the way you are suggesting, the reader has to communicate a bunch of data with the translink server (such as gocard number, bus number, direction, stop location etc etc). The server then needs to process this and send back a response including card balance, whether it's a transfer etc etc. This could have taken more than a few seconds per person in the ideal case. And, because it was a brand new technology, coverage was poor. Public transport operators weren't interested in a technology that only worked at a third of the bus stops and gave away free rides the rest of the time. It seems daft today. But in the late 90s, it seemed like bloody sorcery.
54. OK fare enuf. Seems oddly complicated but probably explained by the system being able to work 100% offline.
55. Yeah I realized this 5hrs ago when 2 people provided excellent info. I admit I was wrong.
56. Yeah mate. After the other comment pointed out the card tech it all makes sense - designed for complete offline capability.
57. "The lord mayor said an LNP government would do a better job providing "community safety" for the people of Brisbane." ... By forcing homeless people away from central areas that have electricity and cooking facilities? How is this making anybody safer you deluded piece of shit.
58. We've traded in Australian Mateship for the good ol' USA version - "I've got mine, pull yourself up from your bootstraps - anyone can make it in this town you're just not working hard enough"
59. They need to be relocated. The concerns are legitimate. Lots of mental heath issues amongst the economically homeless. Council has plenty of parklands - set up a dedicated area with showers, bbq etc in an area that isn’t going to be too problematic. Strict fire ban that needs to be policed.
60. Doesn't help when his council consistently screws over the suburbs and hates any kind of mixed use high density housing which could become social housing helping to get people off the streets.
61. The LNP + being heartless sacks of shit… name a more iconic duo. Perhaps the LNP + doing the thing that will actively make an issue worse.
62. What about setting up a homeless camp at 5/156 Boundary St, West End? Make the people who have helped cause the homeless crisis deal with it.
63. Helping to raise the crime rate so their statement can come true hey?
64. Adrian, as a bcc rate payer let me say how proud I am of you for kicking those who have really fallen on tough times. But really, Where are these people go? To collect their lotto win?
65. the state of the park is horrendous !! the campers have destroyed infrastructure to gain access to power, BBQ's are left in a filthy mess as are the surrounds of the camp sites. Some of these campers are doing nothing to endear themselves to the public. It may well be, the actions of a few are spoiling it for everyone !!
66. Schrinner looking pretty fucking well-fed as he decides to cut off food essentials to the homeless. I'd call him Schrindawg, but that'd be offensive to dogs.
67. For a man who plays up his Christian values this seems at odds with this
68. I wondered could we start a community powerbank library? Maybe people with power and means could charge a few powerbanks each day and drop them off. It’s only a small step but might help power small fans, run a speaker, lights or charge some iPads etc. Community can beat shit policy
69. Council should be providing HOUSING. Not cutting power to rough sleepers. I’m enraged by this.
70. "It's very frustrating with the state and federal government squabbling, when it's actually them that are primarily responsible for causing the shortage of social housing and crisis accommodation," Cr Schrinner said. Pushing the blame onto someone else, it's the LNP way!
71. I work in crisis housing. Working in an NGO, funding motel accommodation for people who are homeless and then working with them to identify their barriers to housing, and how to overcome them. Daily we turn people away because we're at capacity.
72. Fuck him, there has to be better ways to provide for homeless people
73. This piece of shit and his fellow LNP scumbags can all eat a giant bag of dicks... But only after I microwave them for 10mins first. Disgusting excuses for human beings.
74. Nothing to see here just the LNP doing LNP things
75. Even the Catholic Church with all of its perceived issues would make itself look good if they could offer up an alternative for homelessness right now. Schrinner is batting out of his league by suggesting that cutting the power is the state government's fault.
76. This makes me sad..standard MO for LNP politicians. Show strength by smashing the weakest in society. This is what Australia has become
77. They wouldn't be homeless in the first place if the Federal Government hadn't ramped immigration to unsustainable levels, and the State Government hadn't failed to plan for sufficient housing.
78. We need to stop blaming these people for their situation and start helping. Stop calling this a housing crisis and start calling it an immigration crisis due to poor governance…..
79. Can homeless people even vote if they don't have an address?
80. The cooker in charge is busy working on his next budget debacle.
81. Are there no lawyers who are willing to go to court and argue on the behalf of the homeless for free? I'm no law expert, but surely there MUST be something at state or federal level that would require duty of care to homeless people that requires the power to be on.
82. LNP doing this - heartless capitalism devil ALP doing this - restoring order good mayor Typical echo chamber in this r/brisbane
83. Parks are for ratepayers not homeless people to setup shop.
84. Its a state issue and ratepayers shouldnt have to pay for this.
