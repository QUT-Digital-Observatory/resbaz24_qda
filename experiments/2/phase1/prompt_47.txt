Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. I agree fully with you. We need targeted interventions, more collaboration between government departments at all levels, and more importantly we need to stop using law enforcement as our only line of defence. Sometimes that might mean the government stepping in and taking kids away from a bad situation - it’s regrettable, and it must not be taken lightly, the focus absolutely must be on the needs of the kids, and it must be so compelling a reason that intervention in a family unit is the only option left, but the reality is that “breaking the cycle” sometimes needs desperate measures. To be 1000% clear, this is not a suggestion that stolen generations is OK, or something to go back to. I’m saying that the government should be blind to everything but the situation - the kids needs come first, full stop. Community groups can - and must - be looped in fully and worked with to make sure that happens. But QPS needs to stop being the first line of defence against shitty situations for kids, because it’s a fast track to recidivism. They’re not equipped to have to handle what are really complex social issues (I’ve worked there, they barely get equipped to handle simple social issues - I have massive respect for people who stay on the job because they want to make things better, it’s too easy to adopt that cynical attitude you guys all probably recognise that brings out the “ACAB” rhetoric, especially with the shitty conditions, public hatred, and poor pay and funding).
2. Definitely agree on your first point. I think all of the swing voters are very tired of being tired of what I would call the woke virtue signalling on the left. They are actually a relatively small left wing group but they make a lot of noise and people who want nothing more to than to be left alone are constantly being shouted down about whatever the current topic is. Most people in the middle category don't give a toss about your race, colour, religion, sexuality etc and they're sick of being told they're bad people for just wanting to live their life in peace. That small group seem to think the answer is just yelling at people louder (literally and figuratively) but it juat turns them off. I think albo found that out with the Voice, the load minority is not indicative of the whole community. I think US about to find this out again as well. As for Qld, I think we get the same old "budget is worse than though" followed by cuts and outsourcing but it won't be as ruthless as Newman. Will be done using natural attrition, no backfilling jobs etc. 4 years time people will probably have had enough again and back in Labor goes imo.
3. This is right. .. but also months away from phones and social media for young criminals. Teach them to make something. Preferably in a natural setting. People need nature. It's where we evolved. Countless studies show parkland reduces crime. Some we can't instantly make parks, getting little crims into rural areas and helping them learn to camp, fix a car, bulls a structure and especially to keep them offline for a few months would be life changing for many of them. We have programs like this but they need a lot more support and judges need to enforce it.
4. Making major policy decisions based on emotional gut reactions is ridiculous. The entire debate has been LNP and right wing media saying youth crime is out of control, Labor pointing out that crime rates have actually decreased, and then LNP replying with “well it *feels* like it’s worse”. The truth is that LNP’s policies won’t actually fix the problem. But that doesn’t matter because they only need to fix the perception that there is a problem. They can point to some kid who gets locked up, and tell people it’s working. Then switch the media cycle to some other invented problem. Made up solutions to made up problems.
5. For starters my own car was broken into with multiple windows smashed just last year and I've had a few other break ins into my garage as well. I'm almost 100% positive it was the kids from the social housing at the end of my street. Still didn't make me silly enough to vote for "adult crime, adult time". The immediate problem was already being addressed. Youth crime is significantly down, not just in QLD but right across the nation. Overwhelming statistical evidence supports this. Even QLD police statistics support this. And I'm sorry but these people are being stupid because they're angry, and no I don't consider myself above them. I'm stupid when I'm angry too. We all are. But they can't see they've been taken for mugs, these populist policies they voted for will not deliver them justice, nor will it result in better outcomes for these kids, quite the opposite actually. What do you think giving a child a permanent criminal conviction when they were 10 years old will do? Eliminate any chance they ever have at positive interactions with the community, they will never get a job when they're older. I'm not targeting any specific group of people, but when I say angry voters are stupid voters I think it's plain ignorant to argue otherwise..
6. > calling people stupid “Can’t have your car stolen if you can’t afford to have a car! Let’s vote LNP!” \*taps forehead\* Sorry mate. They’re stupid.
7. > a belief of the ruling class that a country needs plentiful struggling workers. 3 US states lodged legal cases to restrict access to abortion pills, why? > “This study thus suggests that remote dispensing of abortion drugs by mail, common carrier, and interactive computer service is depressing expected birth rates for teenaged mothers in Plaintiff States, even if other overall birth rates may have been lower than otherwise was projected,” the suit reads on page 190. https://newrepublic.com/post/187326/new-abortion-pill-mifeprisone-lawsuit-teenagers-pregnant
8. I'm not saying they can't be angry, not what I said at all. History just shows that angry voters are stupid voters. It's how we end up with populist governments.
9. Am an example of this. I grew up with a single dad who dealt drugs on a fairly large scale. A lot of the crap from that lifestyle he chose came home. Yet, I graduated high school with decent grades, have worked my butt off ever since leaving school, and am a (mostly) productive member of society - I work full time in a professional business role. What helped me was having decent support at school, proactive interactions from teachers and members of the community, and as an adult, a lot of therapy.
10. You sir, are part of the problem. Argue against overwhelming evidence to the contrary if you must. But I've better things to do 🤷 Like advocating for actual solutions to youth crime, not populist policies that will create more reoffenders than before.
11. >Just because someone is born in poverty and crime doesn't mean they automatically turn into criminals Too bad now, even if they aren't criminals, it's still straight to camp concentrate.
12. And do you populism is the answer to those serious issues? We've had "tough on crime" approaches before. Do you know why we stopped that and changed, because it overwhelmingly didn't work. Until systemic poverty and a cycle of violence and crime being present in these kids lives from a young age the offending will continue. Crisafulli's populist crime policies will not change that, I promise you.
13. Great, someone who actually buys into this shit. 1. Here's a newsflash for you, they're not scared of 'tough on crime laws'. They feel like they have nothing to lose. 2. This isn't a problem any amount of policing will ever solve. Read that again.
14. You should run for labour because you see the bigger picture and don't have your head in your ass!
15. Why would I not be? I'm now going to be living in a state that will be billions of dollars poorer, and will now be completely ineffective at dealing with youth crimes because it won't have the money to pay for the resources needed to address it..
16. Debbie isn't smart because she doesn't understand the link between poverty and crime. She also doesn't understand that children who go to adult prisons become lifelong reoffenders at significantly higher rates than any other demographic. So really what Debbie voted for, was to make the situation worse 🤷
17. Debbie's reaction is normal and justified. Debbie also doesn't understand the relationship between poverty and crime and the best way to reduce crime is to get people out of poverty. Debbie also doesn't understand that a punishment based system doesn't decrease crime but also exasperates the problem and recidivism rates gp up. The only systainble way of reducing crime is looking at the roots, disengaged children and poverty. But most voters aren't taught this in human geography and development in the education system so it goes amiss in their heads.
18. Debbie isn't smart, she's only thinking short term.. kid stole car, kid go to jail. This is just kicking the can down the road. Prison time won't rehabilitate these kids, it will create a bunch of repeat offenders, this is a well known outcome. What's going to happen is the kids will go to prison young with short sentences for theft or property damage or whatever, come out worse, and then guess what? They're ready to have kids of their own, the cycle continues. Proper youth services have been cut because LNP wanted money for something else. Crime rate gets worse. Labor returns to power and has to deal with it. That's my prediction anyway
19. We weren't saying people like Debbie didn't exist. We were saying the amount of Debbie's was being drastically exaggerated by a media empire that has an interest in LNP governments. We were saying that voting for populism isn't going to deliver the justice victims think it will. Children in adult jails? Overwhelmingly proven to be catastrophically bad for long term outcomes. Lifelong convictions for crimes committed as children? Well that eliminates any chance of positive interactions outside of jail because they'll never get a job with a conviction. May as well sentence them to life in jail. You don't get more populist and infective than what the LNP is promising. We've been here before, we already know an approach like the one Crisafulli is going to use ends in worse outcomes for young offenders and communities affected by crime.
20. Sympathies from Metro North. Everybody is going to be on tenterhooks here at the RBWH, waiting for the first round of awfulness.
21. The LNP wants to privatise ambulances while the ALP was working to expand and build more hospitals.
22. Want to share with the class which party said they'd cut funding from public services for the last several weeks?
23. Yes, changing it back to the government that completely demolished it and we've been unable to get it back to where it was when they gained office. Check out tenpenny genius over here.
24. Also people lamenting about how poor the health system is now forget that it's mostly been ALP that have been in government. Who do we have to blame for the wait lists and shortage of staff? The LNP haven't had the run of the show.
25. Except that’s a matter for the Feds, not the state government.
26. A stable economy didn't stop Newman getting booted in 2015.
27. That's federal, notbstaye. I really wish people would figure outvthec3clevels of government.
28. The Qld economy is slowing the possibility of a rate cut. Labor has not improved that position.
29. ?? This is a federal issue, and I think ur forgetting interest rates were low when lnp was in charge and stayed low. Unfortunately cost of living covid and all of that happened and pushed interest rates housing etc up, and labor has done nothing to address this and no action has been done
30. I'm so angry that I now have to do more work, because the Murdoch media has confused too many Queenslanders...
31. Royalties have actually been a thing under labour. It was the LNP that gave all our dirt away to billionaires for nothing.
32. Queensland is one of the only states with free ambulance services.
33. QLD & Tasmania are the only States where calling an Ambulance is free. The LNP believe, that by charging people to call an Ambulance that will fix ramping. When Newman was in, he cut Arts Funding significantly, then Covid ruined it further. We have a thriving Arts scene in Brisbane & it’s an important part of Brisbanes identity. The LNP will cut coal royalties because it was a promise they made to the coal companies for their hefty donations. They’ve never cared about small business.
34. In Australia, ambulance fees and coverage differ by state and territory. Here is a breakdown of ambulance costs across the country: 1. Queensland: Ambulance services are free for all residents. 2. Tasmania: Ambulance services are also free for residents. 3. Victoria: Residents must either pay for ambulance services or have insurance. Ambulance Victoria offers membership programs for coverage. 4. New South Wales (NSW): Ambulance services are not free. Residents can get coverage through health insurance or subscribe to Ambulance NSW. 5. South Australia: Ambulance services are not free. Residents are encouraged to have insurance, or they can subscribe to a plan with SA Ambulance Service. 6. Western Australia: Residents must pay for ambulance services unless covered by private health insurance or a subscription with St John Ambulance WA. 7. Northern Territory: Ambulance services are not free, and residents can obtain coverage through a St John Ambulance NT subscription or private insurance. 8. Australian Capital Territory (ACT): Ambulance services are not free. Residents are encouraged to have private health insurance that covers ambulance services. Some individuals may qualify for free services, such as pensioners and concession cardholders, but this varies by state and personal circumstances.
35. Brother pollution levels are sky high and we have microplastics in our water and food climate change is absolutely fucking us right now lmao
36. lol you don't even know that other states have different ambulance systems, how ignorant can you get?? Queensland and Tas are the only ones with the free ambulance system.
37. Arts funding becomes tourism and commercial money which becomes tax money which pays for things to make your life better. If you don't care about arts funding, you're just dense and can't be bothered looking past your own nose.
38. Free ambulances is because Queensland operates them as a public service and funds it from general revenue. Free ambulances _aren’t_ everywhere, all but one other state charge fees for ambulance call outs- we’re privileged in that QAS will pay the invoice if another state issues us a bill. People do actually care about arts funding, because with everything being as shit as it is, arts like musicals, exhibitions, etc, can be seen as an almost essential escape. It can also boost tourism - I’ve seen posters for art exhibitions at Auckland Museum (in New Zealand), funded by the Queensland Government to promote Queensland as a place to visit. Royalties already happen - it’s how Labor funded 50c fares and energy bill rebates. LNP have promised they will, as a priority, strip them back to their previous levels if not lower. The LNP also promises that coal-fired is going nowhere. So climate change will absolutely remain a problem - Queensland currently experiences “one in a hundred year” weather events on average- er, every year. And what’s this “small business” shit? You know who’s fucking over small business? Here’s a hint, it ain’t government. It’s BIG business. Basically, everything you’ve said is a lie. I award you no points, and may sky fairy have mercy on your soul.
39. I’m still pissed about the 2013 election, but the 2016 one pissed me off even more. Abbott shat the bed with the 2014 budget, gave Prince Philip a knighthood, ate an onion and then did creepy shit and got knifed because he was deeply unpopular, Turnbull comes in and gives some snake oil spokesman spiel about building a smart economy (whatever the fuck that is) and people lap it up and completely forget that the Abbott mess was the *exact same government*.
40. > whatever the fuck you want to call all of the gold coast. Rich cunts who want to see their $4 million properties increase in value quickly before sea levels rise and make the entire region a water park.
41. 1. Join. 2. Become active within the party to drive good policy. 3. Become active in your community to drive good policy. 4. Remember, there's a federal election within a year, and that will impact everyone's lives a lot more than what happened last night.
42. Amazing how labour can cause an international cost of living and housing crisis! Such a powerful party.
43. you're telling me the guy who got his political start as a journalism major and then a media advisor in the Howard government, lifelong bureaucrat is........ Going to stop using consultants... hahahahahahahah Oh wait, you're serious?......
44. Yeah and he said he believes in a woman's right to chose. However voted against the abortion legislation when it was up for a vote. The LNP have always preferred private consultancy's, over the public service. Because the consultants will do exactly what their paid to do. While the public service will work in the public interest over the Parties interest.
45. I've got a special offer just for you: the Story Bridge for just $1!
46. Because you assume the kids won’t be white say it!
47. That's the "rusted-on" LNP vote, not the swing vote that has clearly swung from the last election. Those are the people who are vulnerable to hype from both sides, and those are the people the top comment is saying will "find out".
48. Maybe there are also baby boomers who are for it not against it because they have children who have had to make a decision to terminate a pregnancy and supported them through it. They might be more forward thinking than given credit for and support women's rights. The whitewash opinion "all baby boomers are shit" is old and a bit insulting.
49. I think we forget that the demographics have daughters, granddaughters, DILs, nieces etc, so potential anti-abortion laws will impact them even indirectly, though it's not a relief of course. It just will be too late to change anything.
50. If you’re UQ, look into Odin Pass. It’s currently unavailable because it’s pointless with 50c fares, but it’d be essential otherwise. Sadly, only UQ can get it - USC, USQ, QUT, Griffith just have to suck it up.
51. We're worried they'll be made to cost money to address the ramping issues. Essentially making poor people decide whether the pain in their chest is "really that bad".
52. Yes and no. The federal government schedules drugs, which controls general access, but the states can further control them - medicinal cannabis is a good example of this. It is possible for the state government to ban a drug that is federally legal such as MS-2 Step. I’m not convinced it’s *likely*, mind you. That said - if they restore the original wording of the Criminal Code Act, you’re fucked.
53. Yeaaah, definitely not calling out for an ambulance ever then, I don't drive and I'm well and truly under the poverty line, I guess I'm shit outta luck, right?
54. Ambulances are free at the moment, yeah, but there's been talk of them getting privatised. And if women's reproductive rights get taken away from them, as many are scared it will be, it might be possible that the pill could eventually be on the chopping block, so to speak. That medicine is used to regulate hormones as well, which is a major form of treatment for one of my disorders.
55. You do realise only one other state has free ambulances? You are deluded. We are privileged to be protected from having to pay fees for calling an ambulance anywhere in Australia by QAS. Queensland actually pays our ambulance bills anytime we get one - if you call 000 in NSW, Victoria, or Norfolk Island, QAS gets an invoice. It can be tens of thousands of dollars if it was from Norfolk Island, and required medevac. Right now, the government just pays it. No cost to you. Australia is more American than you think, and you know nothing because Labor governments have fought hard over the years to stop LNP governments from stripping those privileges away from you.
56. Fuck Murdoch. And Costello. Or whoever replaced him. And Packer.
57. police-sanctioned rallies serve to foster a sense of community, solidarity, and conviction. in this case, it also reminds us to be vigilant because our rights can always be stripped away. it's also a demonstration of shared values.
58. The people who put LNP first (42% of all first preference votes) don't have values in accordance with today's standards? Interesting.
59. They will go in dry and keep you ramped for 18 hours before you can get medical care for your bleeding ass hole.
60. Agree, however had it been a hung parliament KAP would have had some huge pull. Irrelevant now though like you said.
61. Thanks. Definitely never a good idea to not give a direct answer on a question like that.
62. The LNP have clearly stated no such thing, and DC has refused over 100 times to rule out forcing a party line vote to block Katter’s bill. Combined with the fact that he opposed decriminalisation, and it’s well known that many in the LNP opposed it, if Katter’s bill came up in a majority LNP parliament, it would likely succeed. The only spin here is your lies and disinformation.
63. They will die out soon enough. I'm gen y and luckily pretty comfortable, few of Labor's proposed policies effect me but I loved what Miles was doing, because I care about my community more than policies that will directly help me out. I'd like to think that there's more gen y's, z's etc that will act less selfishly going forward when they aren't the ones necessarily directly benefitting. I hope the retirees of the decades to come remember how repulsed a lot of us were by boomers and don't repeat history.
64. Perth is set for an NRL team, maybe I'll move over when that happens
65. The 2007 federal election was widely called a landslide at the time, and that was only 53-47.
66. Absolutely no one was expecting a Newman level wipeout. That will never happen again.
67. State based civil unions and equal age of consent are both things Labor legislated that they can overturn
68. Labour have to bite the bullet and appear more socially conservative to appeal to their base. Currently they only really appeal to a handful of University kids and upper middle class white people. The low IQ poor majority don't care about the social politics they care about safety and comfort like all plebs in all history always have.
69. “It’s not part of our plan” Janetzki answered precisely zero questions.
70. Protest is a valid part of the democratic process. Rioting, however, is not.
71. Also if I remember correctly, last time this went for a vote, only THREE LNP members voted for abortion to no longer be a crime. David was one of them who STILL wanted abortion to be a crime, but his stance seems so strange on it, he's pro-choice, but wants late term abortion criminalised? People who are getting late term abortions aren't doing it for shits and giggles..
72. IF they allow to go to a vote. They don’t have to. That’s what a majority government can do in this state. Just like labor changed the preferential voting rules. 18 minutes from proposed to voted on. Done. The lnp have said they won’t change the law on abortion. And the have the numbers to back that position up. Katter can’t do shit.
73. Is it a case of rose tinted glasses. None of those stats paint a “good” picture. Why are we so worse off than other states. We don’t make as much and we pay just about the top. That doesn’t add up to a good running of things - is that fair to say?
74. Surprise, blow in with absolutely nothing to say praising the LNP is talking shit. News at 7, wait don't watch the news. Please I beg of you.
75. Yes - we are the 4th or 5th best as you said. Hence 2nd or 3rd most expensive… which likes up exactly with what I said. lol… My stats literally come from the first source on google if you type cost of living Australian states.
76. Like all LNP cronies they probably got it from Sunrise
77. Yes, but have you gone through the process of getting permission to protest etc?
78. dont think so, everythings going to be the same darl
79. Worked with her directly plenty of times, she was great for the community and actively took part in improving it and fighting for south Brisbane. Her and her people were great for the area before the car crash
80. The majority of the state supported it at the time and would support that kind of action again. Labor received an increased majority in 2020 following those actions. I know it's hard to hear but your view is not popular and people decided keeping the community safe was more important than an individual's right to attend a funeral.
