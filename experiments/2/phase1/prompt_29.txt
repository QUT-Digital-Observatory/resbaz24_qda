Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. The terms are irrelevent, whether you call it a choice, an abortion or the killing of a baby, the same thing is happening. It is interesting though. What happens when a couple wants a baby and have a miscarriage, what language do they use? "We lost the baby." But if the couple doesn't want the baby and have an abortion, what language do they use? "We terminated the foetus." Same thing happening, but different language depending on how people feel about it. If it is wanted it is a baby, unwanted then a foetus. >you literally did say 100% "the baby will 100% be born unless there is a miscarriage" A miscarriage happens when the pregnancy is unhealthy in some way. >a misscarriage is also called a spontaneous abortion, a women choosing to end a pregnancy is an induced abortion. When the pregnancy is unhealthy, there can be an induced abortion or an induced miscarriage, the terminology is really at the discretion of the users. >a miscarriage from things like alcoholism or substance abuse just doesn’t count in your book i guess Of course it counts, there are all kinds of damaging things a woman can do to harm her baby. But again, abortion wouldn't be a debate if ending a pregnancy was as guaranteed as simply being a drug addict. There are heroin addicted women who give birth to heroin addicted babies. >i genuinely don’t even know why i’m arguing You are arguing because you are in favour of a terrible position. If you lose the argument, you either have to accept that, or change your position. It's the same reason why anyone argues anything contentious.
2. terms absolutely arnt irrelevent, i don’t have to win an argument with you to know i will always protest for a women’s right to choose, i don’t need your validation in my morals i’ve spent a long time defining them for myself, you’re basing a lot of your argument around colloquial terminology while rejecting laws and biology which to me just makes your argument weak. i still have yet to see any evidence that any of you actually care about children once they’re born (i mean you said yourself you wouldn’t give up a bit of your liver and kidney for one so…) even though you stand on your soap box declaring that women who have abortions are killers and as bad as murders and rapists (something you directly said earlier) i will always say it is a step back for our country, a step back for our healthcare, and a step back for feminism in australia.
3. How do euphemisms change reality? The choice you are fighting for is the choice to kill one's own child in the womb. Hiding behind the word "choice" cannot change that. It is killing. Not as bad as killing, it is killing. No, I wouldn't donate half my liver and one of my kidneys to raise a child. Great argument. I have thought about organ donation over the years. It's quite different from changing nappies and feeding a child, don't you think?
4. why wouldn’t you donate an organ you don’t need to save a life? women who are forced to have babies arnt always the ones to raise them so i have zero clue what nappies have to do with this argument, im not saying you should raise a kid im saying if you’re pro life you should be pro life in every aspect of your life, that includes frequent blood and plasma donation, signing up to see if your a kidney donation match ect. if you value life so highly why would you not give someone the opportunity to live through your own selfishness of your organs you don’t even really need? i’ve seen plenty of pregnancies that have much worse recovery then organ donations so if you’re fine forcing women through that in the name of being pro life i think we should force you to start contributing more to saving people’s lives.
5. What are you even saying lmao? "someone wants your organs u should give your organs to people because you think babies that was planned to be terminated but happened to be born live (pre-mature neonate via fetus outside of mothing in a living state) should be given access to medical care (the same medical care you litterally received as a neonate because of your condition...)" >**Achievement of Policy Objectives** >*The bill will achieve its objective by amending the Termination of Pregnancy Act.* >*A new section 8B is inserted into the Termination of Pregnancy Act.* >*S 8B (1) identifies the section applies when a termination causes a baby to be born.* >*S 8B (2) states that any duty a participant in a person’s birth to provide appropriate care to a baby born as a result of a termination is no different than any duty they would have to a baby born in any other way.* >*S 8B (3) clarifies that the “appropriate care” means medical care and treatment that is (a) clinically safe and (b) appropriate to the baby’s medical condition, while “participant in person’s birth” clarifies that the subjects to whom this section applies are the same as those outlined Termination of Pregnancy Act; that is to say, the registered health practitioner who performed the termination, and any other practitioners, including students, present at the time of birth* Please do show me where any females are forced to birth and restricted abortions; You're hysterical
6. Ahhh yes the classic 'calling women hysterical to try to delegitimise their valid fears' approach. You have no clue what you're talking about, this 'babies born alive' bill has nothing to do with protecting those (non-existent) babies and everything to do with chipping away at abortion rights. It's a tactic straight from the seppo forced-birther playbook, they literally tried it again over there a few years ago and now the christofascist nutters here are giving it a red hot go. The aim is to erode abortion rights through lots of little pieces of legislation that introduce more and more restrictions, whilst intimidating medical professionals out of performing abortions via the threat of legal prosecution. But congrats for falling for the transparent appeal to emotion that the whole bill is designed around. The LNP and their ACL buddies are counting on the Australian public to be as stupid and easily influenced as you so keep up the good work champ! 🙃
7. “females” “hysterical” ok bud i know exactly the type of man you are. any restrictions on abortions is a gateway to much more intense restrictions.
8. I didn't refer to anyone by their gender for 1, for two Legislation is as it is written.... Reading it would make it very clear that concerns raised by the people in this forum are infact nonsense. "the seppo forced-birther playbook" / "christofascist nutters" Do you even know what fascism is lmao? you realise people voted for a state party and above that is a federal party and that we are further apart of the commonwealth... You're so fast to bring into question my intelligence yet you're entire view is one of conspiracy without providing any actual evidence of your claims. "appeal to emotion" - You're angry people care about premature neonates? And even if this party decides to push for more changes in the future you realise that is irrelevent to the current amendment right? you know why they are called amendments right?? You also realise that each amendment is voted in as a separate change right? I would also really encourage you to understand people will have apposing views in a democratic society, I understand you seem to think babies that are alive but were not wanted shouldn't have right, i personally think that baby has the same rights as any other baby. Therefore this amendment doesn't raise any concerns to me. To say Im easily influence and unintelligent for not believing in your tales of "chistofascist nutters" that have sole judgement and hearing over laws but only change a subsection in enforce what was a guideline to the actual bill; But then you act as if they have completely destroyed the previous amendments is very much hysterical and nonsense. When really its you that is easily influenced that a party you disagree with puts an amendment to a bill that involves abortion that you connect them to violent bombings committed by [Eric Rudolph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Rudolph) and the [assassination of George Tiller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_George_Tiller) at his [Wichita, Kansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas) church in 2009, acts which were motivated by Christofascism.
9. You know what, I voted for Labour. Now that I have given my vote and the party didn't win, I will just sit back and watch. If that is what the Queensland people want, then that is fine. If you don't vote or you donkey vote, you have no right to complain.
10. Yep democracy works best when all you do is shout 'adult crime adult time' in response to any policy question.
11. Pretty low effort post, but I’ll bite. What LNP policy in particular was the big draw for you? Edit: the coward was so quick responding to everyone but it’s been over an hour now and I’ve gotten nothing but silence. He’s too afraid to communicate a cogent thought on his political ideas because he knows that brought to any scrutiny they’d all fall apart. His only playbook is to act aloof and insensitive to mask this. Classic type.
12. > also Reddit is not the real world. does anyone actually think reddit represents the electorate? like, actually, not just vibes.
13. Is this your "Fuck your feelings" moment? Do you understand how much you sound like MAGA in the US? Maybe kiss my arse!
14. Imagine "GO SPORTS TEEM" is how you approach societal management. OP needs to finally make a friend.
15. OP definitely wanks to posters of Hiltler while he lays in his race car bed.
16. ‘The electorate never gets it wrong’. It gets the government it wants. This is democracy.
17. Reddit is a leftist echo chamber. Any pro ALP or Greens post gets praise and it's obvious. I will now withdraw from reddit tonight and return to my upper middle class setting of home ownership and a decent job.
18. Anyway, you can’t always eat Mars Bars. Looks like the Crunchie gets a go for a while.
19. You’re deep throating the boot so much OP it’s coming out your arse.
20. The majority **didn't**vote for the LNP (or any other party). A majority would be 50%+1 Seems you're the one with something to learn. Try again.
21. I always wonder what people think of their vote for Newman in 2012.
22. What about if you pay taxes but can't vote. Do you have a right to complain then? That applies for many people... Of course they have a right to complain. This "you don't vote, you don't have a right to complain" comment that people in make every election is such a very tired, rubbish, false comment.
23. The majority voted don't like it go to a country where there no democracy
24. I’m 43 and have only ever voted ALP, including on the weekend. The OP is right. 2 days ago someone on here was saying how you can’t have a different opinion with right wing voters and I got downvoted for saying the left is the same. Learn how and why the Australian political system works and is fair for both points of view and stop taking things so personally. It always swings close to centre at the end of the day. The voting majority and not left nor right. They’re centre with hovering views on certain issues.
25. I reckon it's a toss up between "That's not part of the plan" or maybe "There will be no change"
26. I think it’s probably their policy of being huge fuckheads.
27. LNP have already scrapped the outrageous decision to host the Olympics in Mount Gravatt so that’s one positive at least
28. They will never tell you. Their shame is obvious when you look back of the last few weeks and see the lack of comments about policy from liberal voters, and I dont mean propaganda from the Liberal party or the Coal lobby.
29. Less than 12 months later, you could not find a single person who would own up to voting for him.
30. My opinion is about if you have a choice to vote and you chose a poor behaviour. If in your situation and you pay tax, then complain away.
31. "don't like it leave" is always the dumbest fucking response to an election result no, i'm gonna stay and vote again next election.
32. That would mean more if OP had even stated a position in the first place. He didn’t do politics, he just poked fun!
33. yes, no one is disputing that. but you can be in an echo chamber and *recognise* you're in an echo chamber, and most of us do.
34. I hate Hitler and the game he played. I hate Netanyahu and the game he is playing. I hate you for telling me to like eating your shit. You play a sick game.
35. Voted for Newman in 2012, in fact I was in the paper in between him and Lisa as he grabbed me for a yarn at Payne Rd School voting station and a photographer took his chance. I was a public servant then but as someone working in a critical area of service delivery my job was never in doubt (nor was it for ~92% of everyone else). Anna rehired the same number x2 as were let go, so essentially a net gain for the state.
36. Yes then do that. This is a free country I have the right to my own opinion.
37. So does the guy you responded to and yet you tell him to leave? hypocrite.
38. Nah mate. The inevitable 'I told you so' that's coming is enough to sustain me. She'll be a beauty!
39. This is democracy I seen people say they riot or do other outlandish things. If you don't like the results vote next time.
40. I don't live in QLD so to me it is
41. You using the expression ‘boils my clams’ really grinds my gears
42. I've read the statements by a number of LNP rural members or candidates. There's a reason One Nation came out of Liberal MPs.
43. Were you in Queensland when One Nation won big time in one of the elections years ago? I remember feeling so ashamed of the whole state the day after. LOL.
44. One Nation is just a scam to get working class, typical Labor voters, to preference the LNP. I can understand their appeal federally, being anti immigration, but have no idea how they are relevant at a state level.
45. I'm a greens voter and climate change and that carry on is not a factor in my choice of vote. It came down to living costs, social inclusion and a hard push for inequality across the multiple minority groups I am a part of.
46. Sadly, it's so much easier to incite hate into a population (the geriatric Cheeto in the US is a prime example) than meaningful progress or change. Fear is a strong motivator and critical thinking or questioning the motives behind politicians doesn't come easy to a lot of people. As a woman waking up in Queensland this morning, I fucking hate it here.
47. One nation dosnt bother me as much as the cooker katters
48. particularly when you find out that the candidates get $3.33 and the party gets $6.66, for each first preference vote they get if they get >4% of votes.
49. Have you processed the fact that most of the incoming parliament is going to be rural members? QLD rural members don’t exactly have the best track record of being… logical.
50. Yep it's really disappointing. There was a truck crash picture posted here a little while ago and the amount of racist comments that came out of nowhere from that wouldn't be far off 7.8%. To be racist you have to be living in fear, otherwise someone's race is irrelevant. It's so sad, but it's the people who are the saddest and most in pain that inflict the pain on others. My english partner told me she found Australians to be racist (she's white) and I fought her for ages before I realised she was right. There's so much more racism here than we'd like to admit to ourselves. Aside from the obvious overt racism, so often racism can come under the banner of "harmless" jokes because we're irreverent Aussies. There was an Asian bloke who came to play tennis at my local club and I heard people joking that they wouldn't be able to see him at night etc, it's comments like that that happen all the time and make me ashamed to be an Aussie. It's us white people who have no idea what it's like to be a minority and experience racism so we think it's funny to "other" minorities. No way would I want to live in Australia if I wasn't white.
51. It’s all the people in regional areas, they love her for some reason
52. Not a ON voter. But tbf, Sen Malcolm Roberts Financial regulation bills are pretty on point. RBA and Treasury are selling the country on a firewall. Stopping that has to be a priority on this front. Of course there are many many many other areas to focus on but our financial well-being is driven by One Nation here
53. 7.8% racists is fairly low I'd say. Not too bad at all. Unfortunately I don't think it's reflective of the level of racism here. I'd say it's higher.
54. Sadly the greens are a long way removed from their once green environment roots. Sure it is a policy but they care far more about overseas rubbish than the environment these days
55. It was probably more 'who is less bad' rather than who is better.
56. How about that nearly 2% family first vote. Oh god...
57. Before I make this next statement there is no place for racism in the world. If we all supported the same things and wanted the same things political parties wouldn't be needed at all as there would no differing views. Democracy is a sound concept but you have to accept that some will have views that you do share. One Nation have dialled it down a lot over the last 20 years, still not enough but it appears they along with the greens are struggling for relevance.
58. Less than 8% is actually a pretty terrible result for One Nation. They abandoned their one MP in the last parliament because, in James (tiny psychopath) Ashby's own words, he was lazy and wouldn't put in the work. Somewhat ironic that Stephen Andrew is now likely to stay on as an MP for KAP and James Ashby is doing nothing and was a striking failure in targeting Keppel. Oh well, they'll keep up the grift until Hanson decides to finally retire, but they're not a serious entity and now increasingly irrelevant.
59. But none were elected so at least there's that. Most particularly that grub Ashby
60. Yeh well cry about it… people are allowed to have different opinions mate, if you didn’t let them then you would be a Fascist rat
61. maybe that member had better policies than the two party preferred?
62. There's an entire subreddit dedicated to these kind of extremists. It's called r/australian
63. 7.8% is just sad. Do we really have that many lost souls, wow.
64. ONP is all about talking to ignorance and fear. They don’t offer hope, education, or resolution - they just echo the fear and it’s what some people will be drawn to.
65. Unfortunately, a majority of Queenslanders aren't that bright. There are another mob that are rich Tory twats that do what their sponsors and mummy and daddy say. Well, not mummy because she's not allowed to, but you know what I mean.
66. Thing is One Nation isn’t just for racists, it’s also for single and disenfranchised dad’s - which is actually quite a substantial vote out there, credit to them for listening - I’m pretty sure theyr one of the highest suicide demographics. (Not a one nation supporter, I voted legalise cannabis party 1 greens 2 and Labor 3, lnp last)
67. Who would the ones be that voted for the environment? Surely you don't consider the Greens to be about the environment. They are a home for Marxists and Leftists of all different shades. Queenslanders have figured this out and have not given them a seat at the table.
68. It makes perfect sense to me that One Nation gets votes every time. They use the same tactic every time, what has changed in the past 10 years that 30+ year olds disagree with, but are too afraid to say out loud for fear of alienation. For all I know Pauline Hanson doesn't even have her own opinions because her opinions shift so often to suit the flavour of the election cycle. What really boils my clams are young people voting LNP and people voting Greens. These people have no excuse.
69. People care less about the environment when they can barely afford to keep food on the table. Renewable energy is going to make it even more expensive to live
70. Maybe they see the “racism”, don’t like it all that much, but like some of their other policies. Lots of single fathers getting dragged through the court comes to mind. Edit: thanks for all the negs you left leaning knuckle draggers. I provided a reasonable explanation on why people vote ON. She also wants to stop the sale of houses to foreign investors and non citizens, so, next time you all whine about not being able to buy a house, maybe one of her policies could have helped you out. Eat a bag.
71. Here is my logic #4 - Greens - we’ll, they’re communists in green … their economic concepts are simply stupid and will never work #3 - Labor - can’t stand pro union / leftist / woke / pronoun-politics, but at least they’re not completely retarded like the greens #1 LNP - in my eyes they’re the best option even though they’re far from being perfect … and this makes One Nation #2 on my list, as anything is better than the woke agenda etc. This is my thinking It’s right / far right-ish, simply because the left has become unacceptable to me
72. There are so many racist white Australians in FNQ, I call out casual racism on a weekly basis, usually it's clients or people I don't know very well that start a conversation with me in a public setting.
73. At the station I was at, a mother brought in her daughter -who seemed like a first time vote-. The daughter said, "I really like this green guy". Mom quickly went, "No! You fucking vote for One Nation. The green guy will steal your job"
74. "nearly 10% care enough about the environment to try and make an impact" <<< who TF doesn't care about the environment to make an impact? Stopping World War's far more impacts the envrironment than anything else does.... https://public-health.uq.edu.au/article/2023/11/conflict-pollution-washed-landmines-and-military-emissions-%E2%80%93-here%E2%80%99s-how-war-trashes-environment#:\~:text=Chemical%20weapons%20and%20pollution%20from,longer%20than%20you'd%20think. #
75. Queensland vote has been as high as 15-20% for One Nation Why I've always said they're the nutter State As far as Im concern 5% is the most you should get for extremist, anything above is problematic People vote for Liberal, because there's really not any other option People who vote for extremist like One Nation, actively choose to
76. You using the expression ‘grinds my gears’ really crushes my tomatoes
77. This whole thread really put a cigarette in my sandwich.
78. In 1998. 22.68% primary. Eleven seats. Made the 2CP in another 23 seats! ECQ didn't even bother doing a 2PP count IIRC cos it didn't make sense to do so.
79. And the first electorate to fall to them was my old home town of Maryborough. I was very embarrassed but hardly surprised that all those old (and young) racists voted that way
80. Literally still overtly racist. One Nation being more racist doesn’t make the lnp not racist.
81. The amount of people that could barely speak English going through the polling places clutching blue fliers was disappointing. Like, you are the enemy to them Mr immigrant, why are you voting for them?
82. I don't know how they can afford to. Being conservative isn't a white thing.
83. Last I saw, Pauline was farting out some incoherent anti-trans bill, parroting the same ‘vibes-based’ talking points they do in the US/UK. Not sure if it was strictly election-related or just a sudden burst of grifter’s inspiration.
84. I think Family First took a bunch of their votes.
85. You forgot the part about lining Pauline's pockets for nearly 30 years, that's the real reason it exists.
86. You do know the Greens blocked all those housing reforms right???
87. You sound like someone from South Queensland then, every North Queenslander I know supports Katter, they won majority of North Queensland, there’s a reason they do because North Queensland is always left out, both Labor and Liberal only care about Brisbane and shit… they don’t really care about us Rural folk
88. Europeans are a minority globally. Less than 8% of the global population.
89. Casual racism is so heavily ingrained into Australian culture that it makes sense so many people don’t even recognise it
90. I'm white and when my Australian ex learned my last name, his response was, "oh, you're a wog?"
