Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. Just a viewpoint. There seems to be an assumption that people only made their decisions based on the campaign. I think many forget that many people, rightly or wrongly, had probably made up their minds after COVID. Queensland was seen as a fortress that other Australians could not visit because of the government's policy and various antics. Many people see Australia not as the federation of states that it is, but as a single country that should be able to be freely moved about. On one hand you've got a bunch of anti-vax people within Qld getting angry that they're mandated to be vaccinated in order to work. They're likely to be drawn to the far right parties. On the other hand you have a queue of southerners wanting to get into Queensland, either to receive care, visit dying relatives or relocate, which was extraordinarily difficult to do. In particular, many in NSW saw Miles as childish when he tore up that invoice and media coverage there did him no favours. So come election time, I think many of the southern state refugees and anti-vaxxers had it in for the government. Being parochial and protective probably turned out to be a damaging factor for Palaszczuk and Miles. I know many Redditors don't like to hear angles they disagree with, but I seriously think a strategic election blunder was seeded earlier than many realise.
2. Labor lost because they did very little to invest outside of the south east and Brisbane city. Look at the map, Labor will win 2-3 electorates outside Brisbane fringe. Youth crime isn’t a city issue anywhere near the extent it is a regional issue, talk to anyone from Townsville, Cairns, Rockhampton and they will have themselves or know multiple people affected by it, I have and I do. Regional QLD had been getting screwed by labor vilifying mining and farming communities yet using the royalties to give city dwellers cheap fares. Regional voted LNP in and it would be foolish for either party to neglect regional electorates again.
3. It's the Murdoch and Nine media, plus now the ABC (it's headed by Ken Williams, who's worked as Rupert Murdoch's top man in Australia and started Sky News). For a decade they've been screaming Labor bad, LNP good and, recently, about a crime wave that doesn't exist. Repeat a message often enough and it sticks. Give it six months to a year and the electorate will probably be baying for blood, but the lessons of Newman have been forgotten and now must be learned again. On top of that there was an influx of people fleeing to Queensland from Victoria and NSW, cashed up and demographically therefore more likely to vote LNP. There doesn't need to be that many joining an electorate to change its voting profile. Some SEQ electorates grew by 15%.
4. I voted LNP because Labor allowed the Unions, particularly CFMEU to become tyrannical, bringing countless construction companies to their knees and reducing productivity to pathetically slow levels. I voted against Labor because of their footballing of Olympic infrastructure. Palasczuk was too scared. Miles had a chance to show strong leadership when he got in and actually get the stadium ball rolling, instead he was too scared to make a decision and he played the political game and handballs it until after the election, wasting precious time in getting something started. I voted against Labor, for their fear campaign and rather late pie in the sky policies. The huge 'cost of living' handouts that came in recent months that were clearly a lunge for votes. Roll-out of road infrastructure in the last 10 years has been terribly slow, with all decisions taking too long, construction at snails pace and by the time anything is finished, congestion has already started again. Their weak stance on conservation areas. They leased national park land to private companies for rich people to camp on, which should never have happened. They wanted to do it more, but the people pushed back and prevented them from doing too much. Plus still approving large swathes of koala habitat to be obliterated... Miles himself, a deer in headlights, useless as a minister, a puppet as deputy and played way too much politics as premier.
5. People who vote for LNP because the ALP have been in too long need to be removed from the voter rolls for life. They'd be the sort of person who goes to a Michelin Star'd restaurant, claim everything on the menu is rubbish then proceed to eat dog shit off the footpath out front and give it a 5-star recommendation and the actual restaurant 1-star. I'm not surprised the LNP won. What surprises me though are some of the swing percentages to the LNP; talking 10-15% to the LNP. That is a lot of people who somehow think a party with basically nothing positive to offer this state are worth being in power over a party which as been busting it's arse (especially once Miles took over) to make significant improvements for everyone. Every time the LNP has been in power that I can remember, it's been 4 years or complete chaos. They promptly get voted out again and it takes the ALP et al at least another 8 years to fix things back to pre-LNP state, never mind actually getting stuff done they would've if they retained power in the first place.
6. You said it yourself. The Palaszczuk era did nobody any favours. The straw that broke the camel’s back for me was the behaviour of Yvette D’ath as former health minister. I watched her push back against a Royal Commission into the handling of DNA (with respect to crime scene investigation) until it was absolutely unavoidable. When you get that level of incompetence, recklessness and arrogance - it’s time to change the government. Governments are like underwear - they need to be changed regularly otherwise they begin to stink - for much the same reason.
7. I voted lnp #2 overall independent labor and greens last. I will never ever vote labor they’re a bunch of leftie cunts voting green is a luxury I can’t afford the independent will never get enough votes and the liberals are a lesser version of labor. In my mind there’s no hope with them, we’ve tried their way and it’s gotten us no where… I’d rather give someone else a go.
8. Your not gonna find the answers your looking for on reddit
9. Probably more a question for Facebook or Twitter. The vast majority on reddit saw the good work that Miles was doing and were prepared to give him a go
10. This is it exactly, I didn't even vote LNP but I can understand why so many did. What Miles was doing seemed like a good start but we had a decade of Labor before under Palaszczuk where despite solid leadership during COVID, major issues in the regions were either ignored or not adequately addressed. Even now that ALP have lost the election over it people here still refuse to acknowledge there might be a good reason for our decision other than "we just felt like it." By the time this election came around the regions were already fed up with the lack of action, the attitude from the ALP supporters just alienated people and added fuel to the fire leading up to election day (in particular the behaviour from people in this sub over the election weekend has been absolutely disgusting) and this is the result. There's a much longer, more detailed comment I'd like to post when I have more time but frankly I'm not sure it's worth the effort unless people are willing to have a civil discussion about it.
11. I will admit, youth crime in Queensland does seem like a proper issue compared to other states like mine. I actually researched youth crime for my research project this year, and one of the sources I used was a 7.30 report on [QLD's youth crime.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-28/qld-youth-crime-stateline-repeat-offenders-election/103512538) The "vibes" from this article and subsequent 7.30 story was that the youth justice system needed to be reformed from a punitive system to a restorative system, something that, unfortunately, it seemed that Miles and his party weren't willing to offer at the time. Now looking back, I don't blame Crisafulli for trying to step up and tackle this issue, but he's got it all wrong. Just from his slogan alone, he wants to punish this kids even further, which I've already said in the post that this'll only lead to more crime. Yaaaay!! Also it's good to see that WA is doing something cool. I have rather mixed opinions on them, stemming from a) being so far away and b) having a friend from WA do nothing but badmouth McGowan when talking about her state's politics. But yeah, school lunches are great. As long as they've got good options. Wouldn't mind having a government-bought apple in my lunch every day and no meat pie slop.
12. This election more than ever, we have seen the rot that social.media is causing. No one can engage in a discussion, it's either my opinion or you're an idiot. There is no middle ground, understanding or agree to disagree, just batles lines drawn and start throwing spears. Division and separation is winning and it is scary to watch. Where is the calm and grace from losing/winnings parties and supporters? Why can't people just move on like they used to?
13. I like this take, very evaluative of what has come before us in terms of COVID. I know we would like to ignore the events of COVID, but sentiments do fester. It either brought out the worst traits or the best traits out of whoever was in charge. "SHUT THE BORDER!!" comes to mind.
14. Thanks, this was very insightful. I actually had a conversation with my mum and she was like "It's the demographics". \*sigh\* I'm not old, so I don't know why elderly people vote the way they do, and that makes me feel a bit defeated. Perhaps it's the NIMBY mentality. Hate the NIMBY mentality. Gets no one nowhere. Also Fuck Murdoch. I'd spam that a gazillion times but I'm sane enough to only do it once.
15. If Crisafulli bans abortion, I might take a long hard look at the country. Why would a country completely reverse its decision on abortion because of the obvious anti-abortion rhetoric coming in from the States? Oh wait, I remember. "I love a plundered country, a land of corporate gains". We've already succumbed to soft Imperialism, and it seems that we're willing to succumb to it again, even if it's in its weakest form. The USA is the drink, and we are the cup...ah shit that's a meme, sorry lol
16. I'm sorry, but "leftie cunts"? What did the left ever do to you??
17. Alot of this...Palaszczuk didn't do much looking back at her history as premier (I literally just looked it up as I couldn't remember anything but also wanted to make sure)...in his year it felt like miles did more for the people as a whole than Palaszczuk did...
18. The Katters have actually been pushing relocation sentencing for 7 years now and the LNP is actually just taking that as their idea. The adult time adult crime shit is for edge cases like murder and the like and makes a great slogan. Like these statistics are insane: > The Government's youth crime prevention measures are manifestly inadequate and are failing. Shockingly in 2021, 76% of young offenders across Queensland were charged with another offence within a year, 95% of detainees released from the Cleveland Youth Detention Centre in Townsville reoffended within a year and 100% of juvenile offenders on strict bail orders in Toowoomba reoffended within a year. https://kap.org.au/project/relocation-sentencing/ They've done their research and even written a white paper over trialling it.
19. Agreed. It's really disturbing to see how far the brain rot and the US style of fomenting hysteria is taking over. We used to be able to have sensible discussions about these issues and win or lose with grace. Now a group doesn't get their way so they want to spew vitriol and propose crazy ideas like banning everyone from future elections who doesn't think like them? We need to do better, on all sides.
20. >inciteful Insightful? Hard to tell as I am somewhat incited by the current state of QLD politics.
21. If abortion actually gets banned we are going to look at moving overseas, I don't want to live in Little US
22. Left me and my future kids 200billion in debt, increased power bills by 100% or more, introduced new taxes, allowed big companies to get bigger and scam us with no real recourse. I could really go on.
23. Fuck over farmers and mum and dad businesses, while protecting large corporations with bail outs. Few years ago saw them battling whether to tax the lower tax bracket more or the highest one less😂🤷‍♂️ and Steven miles the grub don’t get me started I hope he rots.
24. Yeesh those statistics are rough. But this feels like watered down Campbell Newman policy. Am I wrong for thinking this? Obviously crime is a big problem, but I don't really subscribe to an idea that seems straight out of "*Holes*".
25. \*psst\* If it ever gets banned in QLD, come to SA. Our beaches don't want to kill you, and our government doesn't want to ban your wishes to terminate a pregnancy.
26. And.. where are you getting this information from? Because this actually sounds like policies that the LNP would introduce, especially "allowing big companies to get bigger and scam us".
27. Good to see you have no idea how anything works
28. The state's gross debt is $132b and net debt is $24b (which is a much better indicator because it accounts for our financial assets - NSW has a net debt of $104b and VIC has a net debt of $163b), but that's all pretty meaningless since investment in infrastructure is how we benefit society and create economic return.
29. The state government has nothing to do with income tax or tax brackets, and the federal government was the Liberal Party a few years ago.
30. With all due respect, Australia is already remote enough as it is, and having grown up in Europe and my partner being from Canada, I don't want to remove myself or our children further from our extended families.
31. It’s not whether I have an idea or not, it’s what I see them say and do on all my sources of media, sure we have an excess of royalties but under labor’s rule they’ll shut down all coal all uranium more then likely anything that creates pollution and destroys nature(except they’re extensive solar and wind farms in some of the most beautiful and remote places in Australia) I look at my power bill and it’s increased over 100% what the fuck do you want me to say? New sun tax after they spent billions pushing for solar, they’re cutting exports on meat and putting up red tape for agriculture industry’s, bailing out companies left right and centre while leaving everyday Aussies to rot, my dad got scammed 50grand while licensed insured all the rest as a plasterer and went bankrupt lost everything, same with my uncle. You stay brainwashed because while you think you know it all reality is you know shit all.
32. I hope you don't mind me citing wikipedia, but apparently "In September 2013, Newman announced that bootcamps for convicted young people will open in Townsville and Rockhampton by September 2013, along with two other camps. These bootcamps closed in 2015 under the Labor government."
33. Ah yeah, fair enough. It was worth a shot. Although I heard that the Canadian Conservatives might ban abortion too, but idk if that information is helpful. Gosh we live in scary times. I hope you guys stay safe. <3
34. Queensland has cheaper electricity than NSW (and Queenslanders received the biggest rebates in Australia). However, all states are within a few cents per kW/h. Definitely not "over 100%". The renewables you're against are part of a plan to diversify our grid, provide energy security, and lower prices for the next century. However, a crucial part of that will be scrapped now, and we'll likely be reliant on our existing coal generators for at least 10 years which is largely why prices are what they are.
35. Ah, I see, reading an abc article on it, they funnelled the money into their mates lol. Typical LNP.
36. Not sure if we would move to Canada or not. For your understanding I've been here for around 25 years so I don't WANT to leave, but I have no interest in paying taxes to a government that doesn't put the best interests of people first One of the worst parts of Australian politics is the compulsory voting, it means that scaremongering actually can win votes from people who otherwise should not or would not vote.
37. I’m telling you it went up over 100% I was paying 800 now 1655 not to mention I’m paying monthly now because they figured if we’re gonna fuck them in the ass we better make sure they can pay it, the way forward isn’t solar and wind you mort, the money it would take to only end up being able to support some of our nation is retarded… coal natural gas, nuclear. That’s the clear path forward but the current government despite seeing the whole world develop around them has chosen a path that doesn’t work, cost more in the long run and in the end we don’t have cheap reliable power? How clueless can one be.
38. Solar and wind are to be replaced within 25 years max, that doesn’t account for hail and other damage, we’ve spent nearly 2 billion on both so far probably more, with plans to spend 30 billion or more. So expect so see that cost atleast twice in an average Aussies life if not 3 times. 🤔🤔🤔🤔 for somthing that won’t even lower prices, won’t cater to demand and will have major consequences for the Australian people.
39. I believe in diversity, I’m not against solar or wind but they can only have so big a role, nuclear, renewable gas, coal/hydro wind/solar the perfect storm of power…. I also think we should work away from fossil fuels in the long run but not without proper energy infrastructure.
40. Fair, but I might have to disagree with you on the compulsory voting. My knowledge of voting systems is limited, but here's what I know: UK - FPP, shit. USA - aligns with their whole freedom thing with the choice of voting or not voting, but easily gives way to voter apathy. If the election feels like voting between the lesser of two evils, people can easily opt out of voting, which might allow the unpreffered candidate to gain leadership. AUS - Yes there might be the same chance of voter apathy as the US model, and yes, there may be a higher possibility of having hung parliaments, but in my opinion, it's the best option we've got. Gives the government a better spread of scores or whatever statistics language I'm supposed to use here.
41. Can attest to this, worked at a big place like total tools, the government must have spent over $30k for stuff that was never even taken out of the box, wonder what happened to it as.
42. And they wonder why this sub is a bit angry at the “it felt like we needed a change” and “both parties are the same” crowd.
43. Except that it doesn't, you have votes from people that don't want to vote, and just pick anything that they see. That's why there are party reps at the centres, hoping to gain last minute votes. That means that someone gets a vote based on a pamphlet, so they can get elected even tho the people voting for them will be worse off for it since the advertising rules are completely different when it comes to political advertising
44. I mean, I have reason to be fearful, my wife's a public servant, there is a real chance she loses her job, working in a highly competitive field and an unstable one at that, it might be very difficult for her to actually find stable work, and if that happens there's a good chance we lose our house because my field of work does not pay enough to afford our mortgage. It's all well, and good to tell people to relax when your livelihood isn't on the line, waiting for some cunt to decide to scrap entire government departments because the government can no longer afford it after they binned the tax on mining corps because their billionaire donors needed a new yacht.
45. the last time we trusted these guys, they abused it I think we have a right to be sceptical
46. When Newman did his cuts, within 3 months, I lost 5 youth clients due to the lack of youth liaison mental health services. When Newman decided it was more important to build a phallic tunnel that only cut 5 minutes of transmute, then funding into mental health services for outside of the great SEQLD money pit, I went from having about 200 other trauma psychologists to help deal with certain aspects of the worsened mental health issues, to only 48 others. These two events were interestingly tied to the trickle-down failure of youth, who once got help but now turned to crime. I am hoping this week that the sudden changes in my clients' appointments are not related to the situation of the LNP policing uterus owners' bodies. Because if they do criminalise abortions.... I fear the results of their stupidity because in America, some states have shown an increase in violence on pregnant persons, especially the violence that has led to the death of those pregnant persons.
47. You sound like the kind of person who says "both parties are the same". There are absolutely going to be changes. The reef will see more runoff, your power bills will increase and mining companies will be taxed less. You will see less money for your resources. There are risks to abortion and LGBTIQ+ rights. Children not yet found guilty of crimes will be sent to detention camps. The concept of "Innocent before proven guilty" will be gone for youth offenders.
48. I’m nervous about a few things with a big one being how the massive hole in the state budget is going to be filled after the LNP kill the coal royalties. $4-6billion per year across the forwards isn’t a small amount.
49. I can’t. I have a mortgage and a child and I need my job.
50. You have to understand that it this election makes Queensland seem *not quite as safe as it once was* Abortion once it came up in this context should have been a death knoll for the LNP but no. Instead we saw the opposite in my area, although it’s been LNP to its detriment for years had a huge swing to LNP. Honestly, it seems like guys saw an opportunity to grab some control over women and took it. And you can’t say “it’s not the states” because in the states they never thought Roe v Wade would get overturned. And it did. And women are dying. And rape victims are being forced to have children and share custody with their rapists. And schools are demanding access to girls menstrual tracking apps, women are being criminally prosecuted for miscarriages. Now you’ve got people calling for women to lose their voting rights. Relax? Don’t be hysterical? These are all thing people say right before they fuck you over. The fact that Queenslanders saw the potential for women to be stripped of reproductive rights and collectively decided that was ok is disturbing and shows how much of America’s bullshit has seeped into our culture. This election in a way was symbolic and proved plenty are willing to throw women under the bus without second thought
51. Despite being a labor supporter Im not the slightest bit surprised by the result. Governments do get tired/stale and as OP rightly says Aus politics is very moderate.....but....my issue over the 35+ yrs of adulthood is Conservative parties tend to do very little for society. Yes they do occasionally stuff things as per Newmann but from my experience they dont tend to do much to improve things. The LNP has a huge mountain to climb in Qld and I hope they do try and improve things and dont just play it safe to try and stay in Gov.
52. Queensland has no upper house. I won't take a breath when they have the ability to carry out their election promises so rapidly. Also, fuck you and your condescension.
53. Do you not remember the last time these exact guys were in charge during the Newman years? It was disastrous for Queensland and so many Queenslanders. And they ABSOLUTELY will be stripping women of their rights as they ban abortion again.
54. People think because they personally will probably survive comfortably everyone will, no, not everyone survives
