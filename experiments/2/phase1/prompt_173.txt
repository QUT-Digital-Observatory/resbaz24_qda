Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. It's a good program but when you know why. The lnp policy is lock them up more longer terms etc. The lunches, cheap transport and things like that are to prevent people becoming criminals, instead of just waiting til they are and locking them up
2. I have a friend who was made redundant by Campbell Newman (with a big payout), and was then hired back as a private contractor (for more pay) because they needed her to do the job.
3. If you think about it, it's really just intermittent fasting...which is good 🫣. I tried... it's grim up north mate
4. A lot more renewable energy being made and not spending billions on reviving coal power.
5. What could Labor do to stop every other state from moving here cause conditions were so much better lol
6. I'm in regional Queensland where both my local seats went to the LNP. I didn't vote for LNP. A lot of the LNP votes came from one nation and the greens.
7. 5.4% swing in Brisbane. You want all them to flood too? What a prick.
8. I moved from Sydney to Brisbane in 2011 and never feared for my life more when crossing the road than I did in Brisbane. I found Brisbane people to be cold, cliquey and definitely asserted their rights as drivers over those of pedestrians. I don’t have data to back this up, but in my social circle it’s the people who have moved from elsewhere that vote Labor/Greens and QLD natives that vote LNP. Housing affordability is awful everywhere, but I really don’t think it can be blamed on Southerners entirely. Melbourne has higher population growth and Brisbane and their housing market is actually one of the few that is still somewhat affordable https://www.abs.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases/capital-city-growth-highest-record Us southerners can’t be blamed for everything, and if we all left QLD would be a mess. If overseas and interstate migrants left you’d lose at least half of your public health workers for a start.
9. I really don’t understand the thought process that’s leading people to assume the LNP are going to jump onto building a new stadium at Vic park, especially now that it looks like they have limped over the line pretty much entirely on regional votes. Victoria Park only polls [around 22%, ](https://archive.is/20240504205548/https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/brisbane-olympics-and-paralympics-2032/brisbane-2032-poll-queenslanders-lose-faith-in-delivery-of-promised-benefits/news-story/174ab87dc65103278a6e7bd316e0e366?amp&nk=a36743fcee2c19b9fdb093909e7932f3-1714856164)and the Olympics as a whole are unpopular statewide, but especially in regional Queensland. The Queensland construction sector is [significantly overcapacity](https://www.smh.com.au/interactive/hub/media/tearout-excerpt/25452/r_Wave-5-Longitudinal-Research---Full-report.pdf), so a new stadium build isn’t going to be cheap. I just don’t understand the argument that the LNP are going to burn their very limited political capital breaking one of the few commitments they made (no new stadium), to build a stadium that has limited public support and significant cost and in the process alienate the regional voters that got them over the line this election.
10. I'm sorry you're struggling too. Be gentle with yourself and take the rest you need. Reach out if you need also. I am doing my turtle walk tomorrow so hoping spending time with an amazing women (has been doing turtle monitoring for years) will help. Then I will be coming home and spending time with my flatmate. He's going to be taking it worse than me so I am glad we have each other for support. I might take a mental health day also next week. Just to bedrot and decompress.
11. Given that the federal election is in around six months, they'd be dumb to ditch the 50c fares before then.
12. I'm not going to lie and say the LNP have an amazing policy platform. But there's one message from tonight, it's that the cost of living and housing crisis is no joke. Ignore them at your peril.
13. It's so vague, I have no idea what the lnp policies are.
14. Dude. The ALP approved many mines...you think a mine hasn't been approved in 12 years? 😂 Uuummm..... Righto😂
15. Too right.. lock the little shits up. They'll get 3 meals a day👍 As long as they are off the streets & not committing crimes? It's positive. Not the slightest bit concerned about women's rights. We are doing just fine and will continue to do so.
16. We’ll see. In any case, people knew what they were voting for so good luck to them.
17. People passionate about who is in their government are why you voted LNP? I thought smart voting meant to vote based on policies and the people you want to enact those policies…
18. So like...not on the merit of the LNP platform? Just spite?
19. Glad to see that a sophisticated understanding of policy issues drove your decision 👍
20. i am like him, i think you shouldn't drink petrol its bad for you.
21. I remember Newman. And I remember living under - Joh.
22. Wrong, we should all feel comfortable doing that because crime should not exist! Just like a female should be able to safely take a stroll without fear or worry at midnight if she wants, but nope we can’t do that as it’s unsafe. Reality is that crime is real and impacts our decisions and how we live our lives daily but really we shouldn’t have to.
23. This genuinely might be the most stupid comment I’ve ever fucking read. You’re joking right?
24. Sounded like sarcasm to me, their profile also seems to have a history of sarcastic comments so I’m pretty confident, I can always be wrong tho…
25. My father worked for utilities. Nearly lost his job every time Labour got elected with endless restructuring to cut costs. Now he is retired. They were looking to can his whole department. People really need to understand that what affects your parents with team blue might affect someone else's parents positively and visa versa. Too many just think of themselves.
26. This is exactly the example of reddit propaganda. You know Labor have been the majority over in the last 50 years? Lol. I bet you weren’t even voting age when LNP where last in
27. You guys make me happy. This is what we need. ♥️
28. I know, and even though he can't promise it, time and time again he did effectively say thr law wont change. But then again I stiill cant believe he has still been voted in despite what we know about that vote.
29. Hopefully we are proactive enough to riot. Privatising ambulance isnt going to stop ramping. They need to open more trauma centres and aged care to free up space.
30. Honestly wouldn't be surprised when it ends the prices increase
31. Hope so. It’s of zero benefit to me or my entire electorate, or to many, many electorates within the state.
32. From a state level a lot of projects will be in the shit- gunna be a mess
33. I see what you mean, it's mates the other way around, the party is mates with the unions and twists their arm, not the other way around. I feel ya.
34. One of the easiest ways to address youth issues. We'll just lock them up instead...
35. One of my customers is literally a catering service that does school lunches for schools that "sign up". I'm pretty sure their cutoff for orders is 8:30. So clearly the process works, it just needs scale and the government paying for it.
36. Not every school has a tuckshop operating every day. A city school might, but most rural areas are lucky if they have the staff or volunteers to operate a tuckshop 1 or 2 days a week.
37. Mate, our local state school has 1300 kids P-6, add allergies and dietary requirements how will they get all of that done on a daily basis and have 1300 kids all line up for lunch? Edit: not saying the whole thing was a bad idea but for schools with huge student numbers will be an incredibly hard task to administer whichever way you cut it.
38. Many many schools have “tuckshop” maybe once a fortnight which is home bake made by the P&C. Many, many schools have “tuckshop” that is not every day. Additionally, P-9, P-10 and P-12 schools in rural areas particularly are going to face an awful lot of pressure to fund the initiative for their high school students out of their own budgets. In the many schools in the South East Corner that are 2000+, the tuckshop doesn’t prepare food for 2000-3000 students a day. So there will need to be expansion of facilities in those schools. There will need to be an allocation added to school staffing in almost all cases to account for this. Which wasn’t accounted for. The policy once again particularly showed Labor’s complete lack of understanding of anything outside Brisbane, Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast. Just like their public transport policy.
39. So they’re going to reduce them from the 2013 minerals resource regulation. Super likely lol……..
40. Ok genius, look at the data behind that and let me know the results. Let me know what you find
41. Based off what though? How many people are really affected by this, how is this going to change it? Will the mass served slosh even be wanted by kids lmao?
42. In what universe? We’ve already got people homeless due to the cost of living crisis. Thousands of people that definitely weren’t back then. It’s about to get a lot worse.
43. Oh that intermittent non baseload power... Funny how we have a cost of living crisis and power bills keep going up the more we will out renewables.
44. Easy skippy. I'm sorry that asking for facts hurt your precious little feelings.
45. Yeah, I'm talking about the methed up bogans who live in places like Townsville who see a single ad on Sky about "Yowth Criimeeee" and then immediately vote LNP/ON.
46. Melbourne property has stagnated in the past year or two while Brisbanes has absolutely boomed. It’s really easy to understand. You sell your house in Melbourne for 1.5mil, you buy a house in Brisbane that’s twice/three times the size with a yard for 1 mil. Now you have 500k to invest and sit in a high interest account. This doesn’t take into account the absolute slaughter that is happening regionally where house prices are nearly that of Brisbanes a few years ago. All because cashed up southerners are moving up and bringing their money and pricing out residents who work in the area. People from down south are absolutely bringing their political mindset with them and this will be a struggle moving forward.
47. I don't know what you mean. They aren't building Vic Park. I think they should. It won't be cheap, it's the most expensive solution, and it's unpopular because of that. But I think it's the best long term solution. LNP position is no new stadia. So I don't know what you mean about me assuming the LNP is doing it. I shall be interested to see what their 100 day plan to make a plan comes up with.
48. City LNP figures like Schrinner and Quirk are pro Vic Park. So are pro LNP prominent voters in the architecture and construction space. DC will blame Miles for fucking it up and say they are fixing it and making the Olympics what they deserve to be while not disrupting the Cricket and Football at the Gabba. Vic Park definitely will go ahead. I would be shocked if it didn’t. They can’t rebuild the Gabba as that displaces Lions/cricket for 5 years. That won’t fly.
49. So my shopping is going to be cheaper under LNP? And my rents going down?
50. I dont know anything, except that I love when multi-national companies pillage our country or everything of value and aren’t made to pay anything by the government!
51. Lol, well it clearly won't be very good for us all if they repeal those royalties. How do you think ALP paid for rego, daycare, electricity rebates and such? The only reason not to be concerned is because you already have yours - safe to assume your a boomer.
52. Do you actually fathom how fucking expensive it is to house people in prison? Genuinely
53. Andddd this is why our democracy is a dogshit system, you just admitted your concerns don’t align with 50% of the population, and yet you’re free to vote… for the guys I hope they don’t get someone they don’t love pregnant and are forced to look after or pay child support to a kid they don’t want, and for the women, I hope they don’t fall pregnant to guy wonder who turns around and abuses them the moment they are tied down with his kid, and hey if that’s what you want then I think that’s your choice, but that should be solely your choice, not yours to make for 50% of the population… I’m not even going to touch on the rest of your comment.
54. So they knew what they were voting for, and it wasn't big scary *mUrDocH* hoodwinking the state? Glad one of you lot finally admits the public made an informed choice to get rid of giggles and his thugs
55. Not everyone agrees on the same policies. Not sure why this is such a foreign concept to so many people?
56. A hatred the humanity of those with different options is not something I want to align myself with.
57. Well if you’re doing that they aren’t breaking in you’re pretty much inviting them in and youth crime really is just a scare tactic.
58. Wow… you’re in the healthcare system and yet so misinformed. The next 4 years will teach you a lesson.
59. Ignorant comment, sorry. 14,000 roles made redundant at the direction of someone so far up the bureaucratic chain that they couldn't possibly have any meaningful insight into your individual performance.
60. Hope you're in a private hospital, because the public system won't see any new funding for a while. Enjoy!
61. Yep, and how did the LNP do when they were in governance since the 80's? Hmm, and I wonder why Labor was in the majority over those years? Was it because they elected by the preference of the voters? Just as LNP were today? I'm apparently nearly as old as you according to other comments you've made. So yes, I was very much of voting age when Newman was in.
62. The entire construction industry is crooked, it's so well known it's practically a meme. It's interesting that the LNP only decided to make a fuss recently, and even more suss that they haven't looked any further than the union
63. I guess this is why they shouldnt fix the duke highway, it’s zero benefit to people that live inner/outer Brisbane electorates or many electorates within the state.
64. The point of the 50c fairs is that it also injects cash into the economy without raising inflation. Please use your brain next time.
65. That’s nice for you and all but for plebs like me who are permanently disabled and on payments way below the poverty line, it sure helps me get out of the house more.
66. If you can get any sort of doco or psychologist to sign off saying you can't tap on and off, you can get one. Translink Access Pass.
67. Most of these kids aren't safe at home and are actively killing themselves persuing car thefts. What would you recommend is a good alternative? Group homes aren't working, the foster care system is underfunded/under supported and in some cases, equally as bad as home. These kids are chroming and mentally unstable. What alternative is there now?
68. Yeah I doubt it would've ever applied to rural schools.
69. Because it’s not a mandatory lunch. Those kids can still be sent to school with lunches provided by… there parents.
70. Wow, that would have to be one of the most populated state schools in the State, definitely not the norm! The average student enrolment for primary schools is well under 1,000. Even in high density areas! What school is this? The food is optional. Most kids won't line up for it. Those who do want/need breakfast or haven't had it provided will have access to it. Considering my school managed to handle kids ordering full blown meals consisting of hot foods for hundreds of kids a day... it really isn't that hard. Cereal and fruit covers all special dietary requirements that would be considered reasonable. If a child has such serious health issues that those two choices would screw them up, then it'd be simple to organise that with the school... just like we do for daycares that provide food. Fortunately only a small minority of children have dietary requirements.
71. Almost like it would create jobs in the process or something
72. No... no they don't. You can buy your kid tuckshop every day. Unless the tuckshop is closed due to lack of volunteers, you can just solve that by... paying people. Which would no doubt be included in the budget for it. So... the handful of regional state schools that go beyond Primary will feel pressured? I had never actually heard of that tbh. My brothers regional town has 1 state school and it still doesn't go over year 6 - They have 90 students in total. They just go to the regional high school after year 6 - Which takes the students of ALL the regional primary schools in their much larger catchment area (Highschools are designed to take larger numbers over larger catchment areas). It's really only private schools that do that? Could you show me some examples? I've just never seen that before even regionally. That's still not a valid reason to... not do it, in fact that's a good argument to expand it! Yes... naturally facilities will be expanded. That's what will happen. Problem solved! The funding isn't solely for food... because holy crap! There are apparently 326,000 primary school students in QLD. $1.4b... that'd be a $4,000+ food budget per kid per year. With 199 school days per year... that'd be $20 a day. Will they be treating the children to McDonalds every day? Realistically only about $5-$10 would go towards the actual 'food' part, while the rest would go towards the facilities to provide it.
73. There's tons of programs like this that's preventative. It's also providing healthy food to those who don't have healthy food, and if kids do have it rough they will go to school more knowing they can be fed.
74. We are not going to see mass deaths. Are people going to struggle? Absolutely. Should people be homeless in this country with all its wealth? Absolutely not. But we aren’t going to see mass starvation and famine and deaths in the streets. We aren’t going to have a Great Leap Forward or a Holodomor.
75. QLD has the cheapest power in Australia. Battery’s have been providing more stability to the grid then anything else has at a cheaper price.
76. >Oh that intermittent non baseload power... Funny how we have a cost of living crisis and power bills keep going up the more we will out renewables. You're doing a fantastic job at demonstrating to anyone who knows anything about how the NEM in Australia works that you have no idea what you're talking about, please do keep going.
77. I live in the Yeppoon/Rockhampton area..... People here aren't methed up bogans. I know why they voted the way they did in my area/central Queensland. But don't put blanket blame on everyone in regional areas. A lot of people didn't know about the preferences which played a big part. Plus a new fresh face who has had a long term successful stint as a local councillor and high profile community member. There also has been a lot of youth crime in our area and wider central Queensland. The catchphrases stuck. Because the sentencing of young offenders is actually a problem. I've worked with young offenders. I feel so damn deflated about this election.
78. Gold coast is a lot to blame for this as well, not just regional areas
79. It's disappointing that's how you see anyone who lives north of you. Most methed up people don't bother voting.
80. Blaming interstate migration for this election outcome is about the stupidest thing I’ve read on reddit of late. The swing is in areas with low interstate migration. Look to your own. Everyone I know that voted LNP was born here, me and my interstate and overseas migrant friends all voted Labor or greens. Not to mention that: - most aged care facilities would need to shut completely if there wasn’t migration - particularly in the regions. - police and health sectors are actively recruiting interstate the workforce can’t be found locally - many people move here to study from both overseas and interstate which is good for the economy and supports employment for all those in the sector or that service the sector. Hatred towards interstate migrants is such a backward QLD thing. There’s no laws stopping people from moving around Australia. Get angry at the right people, not people who are here actively helping and participating in society.
81. My bad, meant to reply to the main comment, but fat fingered it.
82. They definitely will go with Vic Park. I would bet everything I own on it.
83. Nope not a boomer. Fact is mate. Qlders have spoken. They gave ALP 12 years & thats enough Id say they lost Mackay because of the awful idea of destroying a beautiful valley for a hydro station. They lost North Qld because of our of control youth crime. People are just fed up with youth crime. Not being able to park their car in their own driveway. Having youths wandering the streets carrying big knives & machetes, getting a, slap on the wrist & let out to do it all again. People are sick of our places being renamed to Aboriginal names & people don't want a treaty. People didn't want to blow billions on Olympics... they didn't even ask Queenslanders. In fact? They just did what they wanted more and more without seeking thoughts from anyone. People had a gutful of that.
84. Don't care. According to ALP Qld has plenty of cash! They've been giving it away like it's a bottomless pit. Happy to pay to lock the little shits up
85. >not yours to make for 50% of the population… But you are also free to make choices on behalf of the rest of the population. You could apply that comment to everything.
86. Not sure of the point of this comment is. Fatherless? My dad was a wonderful man & person. I don't think he did anything dishonest in 85 years! And I'm a mother. Not a father.
87. They knew. I think it’s a choice a lot of people will come to regret, but it was theirs to make.
88. Uhhh so a woman is asking for it if she wears a dress that a man considers too revealing?
89. At this point, they've just made a night of it (and past few days at least) trollbaiting around the different subreddits so not a lot to be had arguing/debating with them. I wasted my own time tonight already, letting myself be engaged by it.
90. Tbf, it's my understanding that most of those roles were administrative.
91. We could save enormous money with this mindset. If it doesn't help everyone, it's a waste of money. Just give me rebates and cash back. Works for me.
92. The point of the 50c fares was to buy votes in Brisbane. People in the regions saw it as yet another slap in the face and reminder that they don’t matter to Labor.
93. And what about all the disabled people living in the rest of the state who can’t access this?
94. I'm used to it...ALP had us all eating shit for years
95. Inefficient use of funds is bad. They know it's a waste of money. Miles brought it in a mad dash to try to buy votes because he knew he was going to lose and didn't care about the consequences. Cris said he would keep for a term to make it a non voting issue despite knowing it's a bad policy.
96. First of all the last time the QTU took strike action was pre Newman.
97. It would have but it would have involved partnering with local businesses like a cafe or even just someone who can do the food.
98. Why are you talking about cereal and fruit? The proposal was for ‘hot’ school lunches, not an easy pour out of a box breakfast.
