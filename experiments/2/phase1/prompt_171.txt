Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. The majority of inbound interstate migrants are aged 25-34, followed by those age 35-44. We also lose a lot of people aged 25-34 who migrate interstate, so the largest net gain is people aged 35-34. But if we‚Äôre talking purely about numbers coming in (who would then be voting) it‚Äôs that 25-34 age group. https://profile.id.com.au/comseq/migration-by-age No one has any evidence that the swing to LNP is caused by interstate migration. A lot of the swing is in areas minimally impacted by interstate migration eg up north in places like Townsville.
2. Yeah it was part of Albanese's first budget because the libs had privatised and gutted tafe nationally
3. Meh, wait and see. Out of my control. I‚Äôll keep living my life.
4. That‚Äôs much more dignified than what we said. She was Probably the girl at school who was teachers pet and dobbed on everyone.
5. Expand the federal police force with the previous state police. Municipal police forces are generally a orruot nighmare. Laws could be nationised as is happening with this countries WH&S regs. Yes huge set up cost but cost saving long term. I worked in local government for many years and the state and federal bickering was exhausting when it came to funding/finance and compliance.
6. Let me be clear, You are the minority who think liberals can do a good job. They only got voted in because the whole "labor has been in too long" message if that didn't occur Liberals wouldn't of won as we know that they are simply corrupt and provide nothing of value to the country and states.
7. And you know what, majority of Queensland AGREES with this statement Shocked pikachu face üò± Leftists in shambles
8. Except based on previous record, the other mob has given up being the "fiscally responsible" party because their policies made life harder for the average person while benefiting foreign interests.
9. And more to come! So good taxpayers shouldn‚Äôt hold public assests when there‚Äôs profits to be made by the 1% then negative gear a bunch of investment properties to off set all those tax dollars.
10. I love that you get down voted when you actually prove your point lol
11. Can‚Äôt wait to see it fail hard, and they blame it on ALP haha
12. Yeah na. I‚Äôll invest my time on good things for the betterment, rather than arguing with a rusted on ‚Äòmining is good for us‚Äô diatribe. Same argument as gambling is good for sport. It is bent. See ya.
13. my comment wasn't explicit about time frames. We will run out. Catastrophic effects of anthropomorphic climate change will happen. Natural climate change too. The other factor is that we will only make money on coal for as long as the world demands it. Taking a cursory look at the energy transition of the rest of the world makes black coals outlook short-sighted.
14. Have you not seen the charge coming forward for solar on roofs now due to excess solar going to the grid? Yet we are still being fucked by elec companies and being paid so little per kw/h we put back into the grid? Renewables aren't the only answer.
15. The current NSW premier is Chris Minns, the leader of the New South Wales Labor Party, who assumed office on 28 March 2023. Minns defeated Dominic Perrottet at the election held on 25 March 2023, after twelve years of Liberal/National Coalition rule.
16. Ha. I admit I stuffed up, cut and paste and didn‚Äôt paste in the 2nd half correctly. *Had liberal for 13 years before last year. I‚Äôm not right winger, I don‚Äôt have any affiliation and I vote with whoever‚Äôs policy I agree with. There was no aggression, I completely disagree with your comment that people left a failed liberal state and moved here to vote LNP. Of the 120k people migrating to qld every year how many do you suppose moved to the regional areas that had most swing? Victorians had the highest migration of any state from their failed labor state.
17. Stop using logic mate. He just told you that you are wrong emphatically. That is all that is required these days on reddit. How anyone who has watched any political commentary or has any knowledge of political history in this country would think that QLD is less conservative that NSW is dumbfounding. Just don‚Äôt engage.
18. I‚Äôm not happy about it since I take the tram to work. It‚Äôll increase my expenditure again and as a student living on their own, any savings is good.
19. That‚Äôs not why they were voted in. Labor is has been in for ages, and where are we for it? Housing is insane, cost of living is insane, youth crime is rampant (don‚Äôt say it‚Äôs not, I see it). People obviously want change. And because reddit is a massive echo chamber for the left, rather than look at Labor‚Äôs failings, they just scream and shout about ‚Äúhow could this have happened, we are all doomed‚Äù. If labor did a better job, they‚Äôd still be in.
20. "Labor has been in too long" was all it took to sway former Labor voters loooool
21. Another issue is the size of the public service in QLD. This becomes the ‚Äúaverage person‚Äù because they employ so many people. There is no effort to make the state business friendly - which is why QLD doesn‚Äôt host any head offices. All business of size moved to VIC and NSW.
22. No worries. Mate it‚Äôs unreal how far left people are on this forum. Legit hard to get people to stick to facts and not fairytales their dads told them. Crazy times.
23. Good on you. More than happy for people to present alternate viable views. Not sure you really have. I was trying to have a discussion. Mining is bad and I‚Äôll argue for something better‚Ä¶ without any claim of what a better option. I‚Äôd love for us to diversify our economy. But your suggestion the ALP is good and LNP is bad just doesn‚Äôt cut it with me. And please my views were hardly a ‚Äúdiatribe‚Äù. Unless you genuinely feel I‚Äôm being aggressive and forceful with my views.
24. Lmao!!!!! The world is over populated!!!! The polar bears are going extinct!!!! Greta told me it would happen!!!! Fuck off doomer
25. They aren‚Äôt, but right now they are the best and cheapest we have. I for one would prefer cheaper electricity for the next 10-20 years, then we can decide what is out there and if solid state power storage is better by then, and integrate into the grid. Rather than have to fix coal to last us 10-29 years for a nuclear power station to be built and start running, and then pay more than 4 times the cost of electricity compared to current renewables. What we do know is that renewables have become cheaper over time, renewable electricity has become cheaper over time, nuclear is up to 4-8times the cost per kw/h so electricity bills will be much more expensive.
26. Yeah was gonna say NSW has been liberal a long fkin time
27. So, how could you vote for the LNP then? Not only did they wait until the last minute to release their policies and costings but it was an absolute weak and thin joke with holes everywhere. Anyone pre-polling and voting for the LNP did so without a scrap of knowledge on what "their plan" was. I specifically spoke about the COVID migration QLD received from NSW because frankly, we had it **much better** up here than NSW. My comment was not remotely purporting to be fact, I was also curious like the original commenter I replied to. That was obvious. And calling Victoria a failed Labor state is laughable at best. They hated Dan so much, they voted him back in for goodness sake. They were looked after while NSW was on tanking incredibly. On the note of the timeframe I was originally referring to: The Labor premieres along with Sally McManus were the ones who forced the federal Libs into paying JobKeeper... Except the Liberals then went and fucked it up by paying directly to employers instead of individuals (as per the original submission). Morrison's brilliant idea was to let people plunder their super. Let's not forget Robodebt, a highly illegal scheme (that was known to be illegal) that killed our fellow Australians and forced many into hardship and poverty... The Liberals across the country, state or federal, have terrible form in countless areas. And they are factually utterly terrible managers of the economy, which seems to escape those who don't want to do literally even just some cursory research. >There was no aggression Uh, ok. That's not how your aggressive comments about me apparently being ill informed and uneducated came across.
28. Well known advocate for progressive policy and lifestyle, Joh Bjelke-Petersen
29. "*Labor is has been in for ages, and where are we for it? Housing is insane, cost of living is insane, youth crime is rampant (don‚Äôt say it‚Äôs not, I see it)*." By the data Youth crime is lowering, Thats alright if your opinion goes against it as thats just your opinion, I'll rely on the data. Cost of living was being addressed through various measures like rebates and 50c public transport that will be scrapped under the incompetent LNP.
30. I‚Äôm not disagreeing with you, just saying it‚Äôs their plan. By my accounts, were in violent agreement that it‚Äôs all shithouse
31. it's a lot of information, but the topic is well established: https://adepteconomics.com.au/does-nuclear-energy-have-a-future-in-australia/ https://ieefa.org/resources/nuclear-australia-would-increase-household-power-bills https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/is-nuclear-energy-feasible-in-australia-and-how-much-would-it-cost-20231004-p5e9qc.html https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-20/nuclear-costings-absent-power-bill-rise-supply-shortfall/104374718 https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-06-11/nuclear-power-for-australia-cost-and-timelines-explained/103641602
32. It‚Äôs not an opinion, it‚Äôs an experience. I‚Äôve had to chase 2 lots of kids away from breaking into my home in the last 2 years. Never once before that. My community page has CC tv of kids trying to break into houses, weekly. Cost of living measures, you mean the ones they recently put in just before an election? Just so they could try and win votes? Why not do that 2 years ago? And why not try to fix the actual causes of the cost of living, over little bandaid fixes? Labor has been in for a long time, and we are in a shit spot. That‚Äôs why LNP is in.
33. In SEQ You are part of the problem. If you are a reflection of the average thinker the Labor party has, unable to look at regional data and understand that crime trending down *statewide* does not mean that it is trending down *everywhere across the state*, then you are going to be in opposition a long time. But please, keep on denying reality. We have come to expect nothing less from Labor over the past 35 years.
34. Haha the face at the end was making me question
35. Why is cost an issue? I wouldn't put a price on having reliable clean power. Focusing on it from an economic perspective doesn't make much sense when the goal is to have reliable, clean energy. The only thing stopping us from having nuclear power is a lack of political will. The same thing that has held us back for the last 50 years. With the materials needed to produce batteries becoming a possible strategic resource, long term planning should include nuclear as a part of securing base load generation. Phasing out coal and moving only to battery storage for renewables may be cheaper and faster, but it is not a long term solution.
36. "I*t‚Äôs not an opinion, it‚Äôs an experience*." As I said thanks for your opinion. "*Cost of living measures, you mean the ones they recently put in just before an election? Just so they could try and win votes? Why not do that 2 years ago?*" No I mean the ones that have been around for the last 18 months. "*And why not try to fix the actual causes of the cost of living, over little bandaid fixes?*" LNP aren't going to fix anything, they will make it worse and I can't wait for you to eat your words over it but then again being an LNP shill you won't. "*Labor has been in for a long time, and we are in a shit spot.*" Yet we are in a great spot, Well we were under these LNP clowns got voted in. If we want to compare to a shit spot lets look back to the Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen era where Queensland was at its lowest and the reason why Labor has been in the last 30 years out of 35 years since with his near Dictatorship over QLD, Using QPS and other gov agencies to silence critics and Track/spy on opposition politicians for twenty years. [Watch this video for more context surrounding it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG_w-b_V1qQ)
37. "*In SEQ You are part of the problem.*" Across the board unfortunately, I know that doesn't play well with misinformation/lack of facts you have. "*But please, keep on denying reality. We have come to expect nothing less from Labor over the past 35 years.*" It seems you are the only person here denying the facts and data.
38. But in 10-15 years when the nuclear power is up and running, and cost 10s of billions of dollars, who‚Äôs to say that solid state batteries aren‚Äôt easily made and readily available? It just seems stupid to jump on nuclear today, betting that in 20 years we would have nothing else? Why not just invest more in cheap renewables now, reap the benefits and cheaper electricity, then make a call in 10-20 years? I for one would prefer cheaper electricity. Not sure about others in Australia.
39. I don't disagree with nuclear overall - I think it has been proven, and aside from a few notable events of extreme circumstances (natural disaster, and 2 counts of extreme human negligence) it is viable. Economy at a certain point must be a factor in a society, and world, built on monetary value and the impact it has on the society. I wish we lived in the world where economics aligned with our absolute needs, it sadly isn't the case. Example is the UAE, an Autocracy, still took 15 years to get one plant operational. Democracy is a much larger hurdle to jump over
40. Because future generations will have to pay it off. Why put an extra burden on the next few generations. It's very narrow minded way to think.
41. Qld police data shows crime rates trending up in the regions. You are outright lying, and still think you are in the right. Absolutely delusional. *People like you are why Labor lost* The lack of acceptance and accountability from you Labor folk is staggering. It is honestly hard to reconcile in my own mind how out of touch you lot are. I assumed it was rhetoric leading up to the election, but it's becoming clear you actually don't see anything wrong with your behaviours. Fascinating
42. Governments shouldn't gamble on maybes. We know nuclear works, we know we have the resources to sustain it indefinitely in Australia alone. Batteries will be cheaper for now, so long as the resources are available to keep making new ones. There are hot and cold proxy wars being fought in Africa right now over the minerals needed for batteries. Relying on resource we do not control for something as essential as energy is a poor strategic decision. Every investment is too expensive for some people, until it's needed, then they are usually the ones who will take the credit for being forward thinking when they had to be dragged kicking and screaming into the future.
43. Because the alternate is less reliable or worse for the environment. In the grand scheme of things cost is a non issue, it's a political issue.
44. We know batteries will get cheaper, we know renewables will proved cheaper and crappier electricity. We know nuclear will be be more expensive, we know it won‚Äôt be able to expanse later if needed, we know we have no way of disposing waste, and we know we won‚Äôt have nuclear running for at least 20-30 years. Based on what we know, I don‚Äôt get how you could still say nuclear.
45. We don't know that batteries will always continue to get cheaper, because of the reasons already noted. The scramble for battery materials has already begun, and there is no surety on how it will play out. Despite the upfront cost, the benefit of nuclear is consistency. It is know how much it will cost, how much it will generate. It is well established technology. I am not opposed to batteries as a stop gap to bridge the transition from coal to renewables, however I believe ruling out nuclear as an option is short sighted given the instability of material supply for batteries alone.
46. Well it‚Äôs good you aren‚Äôt opposed to batteries as we will need to invest in it anyway as a stop gap between now and nuclear. Currently globally there is global push into research for energy storage, as most countries have also acknowledged the future will require energy storage. Many of the storage options do not involve batteries btw. There is research into readily available materials and even waste products repurposed.
47. "Better" is a very subjective term to use when talking about infrastructure that is essential to the very existence of our nation. There are good reasons to want nuclear power to be part of our clean energy future.
48. Positives - democracy doesn‚Äôt start and finish at voting. Keep in touch with your local member about issues that matter. Tell them you want to keep mining royalties. Tell them about homelessness in your area. Report crimes when you see them. Make a public interest disclosure if you see someone in office do something corrupt. - 50c fares, let‚Äôs hold them to account on this - increased police numbers - again let‚Äôs hold them to account - Crisafulli says there will be no change to abortion laws, so Labor calling this out should help safe guard this. Miles has actually done an astounding job getting Crisafulli to commit to some of the big things that matter. I‚Äôve actually been really impressed with his leadership and hope he stays around in opposition.
49. We got some great policies out of this term of government that will be continued on, especially the 50c public transport, which will be unpopular to roll back. I'm glad we got what we got tbh
50. The Queensland Teacher‚Äôs Union might finally grow the balls to take on the government and improve conditions for teachers, now that their friends aren‚Äôt in power any more.
51. At the headquarters of a mining company in a tax haven somewhere, a line on a graph will go up a bit.
52. A lot of things have been started that can't be stopped. From 50c fares and Qld made trains and buses in Maryborough to the massive amount of renewable energy projects being built in QLD, the Satellite Hospitals and the housing solutions. We have left a solid legacy for the state and one that the LNP can't immediately chop. Obviously there's still some things like Pioneer-Burdekin, mining royalties and youth justice that are very disappointing but all in all we not only forced the LNP to play a small target but we forced them to move to the centre and adopt some genuinely progressive social policies.
53. over the next 4 years you get to see first-hand why we let Labor run things
54. Well, kids whose families struggle will not have free food at school to keep them educated, but we have plans to lock them all up now, so you won't even know they existed
55. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt take on/accepted for a graduate role with qld gov public service. It would have meant moving to Brisbane and then finding out in no time my position will be made redundant‚Ä¶ I could see the writing on the wall there: first in first out. Newman years were lousy in my last public sector role.
56. If Cris really screws Queensland quickly, it might keep Albo in government over Dutton in the federal election.
57. I'm honestly gutted, i was actually leaning towards voting for LNP prior to Steven Miles taking over because i felt like the labour government wasn't really doing anything. I completely backflipped on that notion once he introduced the 50c fairs and actually stuck to it. I was hopeful that he would get re-elected because it seemed like he actually cared and was trying to implement change. But now it feels like it was all for nothing. What sucks the most to me is that i feel like people voted for LNP just because they wanted change for the sake of change. They had no noteworthy policies on the table (happy to be corrected) and Crisafulli came across like he had no clue what he was doing (going off the clips of the debates and the whole thing regarding abortions). Either way I'll remain hopeful that we won't end up going backwards with the progress that we have made and that the LNP will be held accountable for any mistakes they make.
58. Life goes on. We survived Newman, we'll survive a change in government. The alternative to our democratic system is having a dictatorship that lasts a lifetime or generations. Take it on the chin and move on. What we don't want is the state of politics like the US where lines are drawn between people and they can't even get along and ready to tear themselves apart. Edit: and if the government of the day does something vile and undemocratic, then do your part and raise your concerns, and protest if you must.
59. LNP will achieve NOTHING, they will do NOTHING, but they‚Äôll take credit for Labor‚Äôs policies and initiatives and likely fuck something that was genuinely helping people.
60. I literally feel like I've been abandoned. I'm feeling incredibly sad and hopeless about these results. I feel like what's the point in fighting for change when it's the same shit every time. Our environment is going to be destroyed, housing will remain unaffordable, but big businesses will be fine so it's okay. You wanted this QLD, so you got it.
61. It wasn‚Äôt as big win that the LNP would have wanted so the abortion debate really put a dent in them. Also Miles force Crisafulli‚Äô s hand and he said he supported a woman‚Äôs choice, so if he brings the conscience vote in he will be out next election. Also last time LNP were in for more than one term was Joh. They will fuck it up, they repeat the same mistakes as Newman and be out. The benefit of not having an upper house is that all their fuckups will be reversed.
62. Regardless of your voting preferences, or other people's voting preferences; if you're in trouble on the side of the road...another Queenslander will probably stop and give you a hand. If a fire or flood, devastates your community, a fellow Queenslander will stop to give you a hand, even if they've had it rough. You drop a coin, or something at the shops and don't realise it...9/10 times; another person in your community will probably stop and let you know. I don't know, if that helps; but it's the reality of the situation. "And when you give that speech, you're boring Springfield"
63. QLD becomes a less desirable place to live due to LNP, resulting in house prices tanking
64. Stadium fuckup will get mostly fixed. Only thing I can think of.
65. I am thankful I planned ahead and got emergency meds. My mental health just tanked and thoughts went immediately suicidal. I'm also thankful I have parrots because I need to get through for them I'm likely losing my job Monday because of this. I'm not okay.
66. I don't think they will do much that's controversial if they're hoping for a second term. You may not see much difference in your day to day life.
67. I guess it's okay now to be corrupt because our leaders are?
68. The rest of the country will get to see how behind QLD is compare to everyone else. Let's see what they do with the Olympics for example. Not looking good bruv.
69. I just hope this result in Qld doesn't trend to the Federal level.
70. The main positive is LNP blew a massive lead and barely eked out a one seat majority. This isn‚Äôt the story of Labours loss, this is the story of Chrisafulli folding in the final weeks as Queenslanders saw through his dog and pony show.
71. Use that disappointment to get involved in the political system outside of 6 weeks every 4 years. The majority of governing happens between elections.
72. there are now 0 one nation seats in Queensland (at a state level)
73. The positives is that you should invest in mining companies in QLD but they'll be sure to make money. And maybe invest in probate prisons operating in Australia. You should be happy that LNP has promised to continue the 50c fares, for now anyway. If you're not a woman, or one that can't have kids, or one that supports pro-life then you should feel comforted by the fact that abortion rights might change.
74. good news is you now have a list of places to avoid
75. The LNP will only be one awkward hot mic or inappropriate social media post from years gone by from falling into minority.
76. LNP supporters (or anyone who questions Labor) don't last very long on this sub, so I wouldn't expect much of a response
77. we're on the verge of ww3 which will make the election feel trivial! üò¨
