Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Typical person thinking in systems with not a shred of empathy. Yes it is a state and federal govt. issue, but it's also a humanitarian issue is it not? Okay - so council is getting little support, state and federal govt might not also be assisting much as it's election time. But do you think cutting their power was a good move from a humanitarian point of view? If someone you know was homeless in a park near you, and asked you for help; would you say 'Nah mate, that's a state and federal govt issue, sorry can't help'? Fuck you to assume that we're normalising people living in parks. You don't assume that for me. It's a state of crisis and a lot of smaller community groups are rallying to help in any way they can at their appropriate level. But this numpty Schrinner just made a dick move - and there's not much to be argued that can support his actions.
2. The federals could make housing affordable today and it would be political suicide because it would mean the end of everyone's gravy train. You know this. Nobody gives a fuck about anyone in this country anymore and the least the coucils could do is keep power running for people who we've all turned our backs on because newsflash... NOBODY WANTS TO BE FUCKING HOMELESS. Dumb cunt.
3. And the dog parks, they're never going to grow up and pay rates
4. You’re right. In normal times parks ARE for social interaction and enjoyment. But these AREN’T ordinary times. Same thing during natural disasters. Different levels would work together and coordinate with community groups. This is a MAN-MADE disaster. Let’s work together and solve the problem. We’ve got the space, all we need are decent temporary shelter, we’ll maintained and supported with appropriate facilities nearby and support services for the people. We can do it. We just lack leadership from all levels of government.
5. Common. Some people are incapable of pulling their heads out of their asses. So much so that evidence is lacking and emotional downvoting shows the emotional intelligence of a pair of rocks. Come at me stupid downvoters.
6. Yeah and they are all conveniently placed to ensure cyclists are moved out of the way of cars. The green paint is just an extension of car infrastructure, there solely to ensure cars still have priority. Very few instances of it are actually good for cyclists :(
7. Do you have a source for this? I like our bikeways... :(
8. Correct. I'm not suggesting giving away houses obviously, I'm talking about the need to have access to electricity which the council absolutely can arrange.
9. I'm talking in terms of lack of parking, public transport, amenities, houses being too close together etc. The usual issues with high density living we're starting to see everywhere.
10. Also in the industry dealing with councils and developers and absolutely no love for developers but my experience is large expense and significant delay is endured to achieve approval (usually the developer wants more, council wants less, depending on site they meet somewhere in the middle or more often than not council stands firm). I'm not crying rivers of tears for the developers but usually they just want to get the project approved so they can sell the lots or start building and free up capital for their next project.
11. Did you mean to reply to me or are you lost?
12. As I mentioned, you dont have to, but the response to cut electricity without a transitional plan for support in place shows the natural callous disregard for these peoples safety and wellbeing. I really hope you never become homeless, because you might end up like one of these people. And leopards will have eaten your face for agreeing with something that bites you in the ass later.
13. so how on earth does that relate to the Brisbane City Council ..... refer my previous post to you !!
14. surely these campers can live in a civilized way without being total grubs !! These grubs are bring the whole area and their decent campers into a state that would and is intolerable to live in.
15. It’s not the vandalism that is the problem, they’ve been doing dangerous unlicensed electrical work.
16. Yes, because it’s a park. Not a homeless shelter. Nor should it be one. The homeless need support, we probably have very different ideas as to what that looks like. My definition does not extend to turning local parks into semi permanent homeless encampments.
17. I certainly do have empathy for those that are doing it tough and looking after themselves. There really is no excuse to vandalize and destroy public property. One also has to discover why they are homeless ? I have spoken to several, some sad tales for sure but others have chosen that path.
18. yes i am sure they had to open the ones the were not already opened, a different photo shows a cut cable with red tape, i doubt people put the power board to charge phones after the power was cut, so they had already broken the door/lock to get inside
19. Agreed, but housing is a state government issue, compounded by federal government importing a few hundred thousand people in the middle of a housing shortage. Council is bound by the local government act 2009, they can’t solve these issues. They are massive macro level problems, excluding dictatorships that have “disappeared” the people, has any country, anywhere actually solved them? Council is the lowest level of government. If you need zoning permits, You’ve come to the right place. If you want to solve mental health, generational trauma, addictions housing affordability, etc. they can’t do that. What they can do is represent the views of ratepayers, protect council assets, maintain the social contract and uphold the common law property rights that are a pillar of civilisation. You may not personally want the power shut off, but musgrave park is genuinely a dangerous shitshow that causes grief to the people in the surrounding areas. If council ignores the rate payers (noting, homeless people can vote but rarely do), you erode the social contract. They pay rates to have nice facilities, not to have constant drug use, violence, etc in their local park.
20. It’s a park paid for by rate payers who do not want to live next to a permanent homeless encampment with all the associated issues that brings. It’s both not the role of council to do this and a sure fire way for any councillor who supports it in their own division to lose at the next election. It’s a representative democracy. Councillors represent the views of the voters and rate payers in their division. It’s been clear for years voters do not want these camps.
21. I’ve just corrected a mis-spelling to make it read ‘under-utilised’
22. Yes I absolutely think cutting power off is the correct move. Did you miss the tent fire last week in musgrave park at the homeless encampment. There would be minimal power outlets but probably a long ass extension cord with power banks and the like all daisy chained which is a huge fire risk.
23. You can literally just go to the sub and list by top rated posts this week. It’s not hard.
24. There was a source, but id have to sift for hours through posts like these sorry 😅
25. Why do people always list "lack of parking" as their first thing. Like geez, if it makes prices come down or at least stop skyrocketing, thats money in my pocket. Ill tolerate shitty parking lol.
26. Yeah fair enough, that somehow ended on the wrong comment
27. Given the housing crisis, Council efforts to screw people over instead of provide social housing (which is normally a local council responsibility anywhere else) are cruel and unusual. Providing social housing is a local government role in almost every other developed country (ignoring the 200lb Gorilla over the pond).
28. When was the last time you were homeless? What specific difficulties in your life made you vulnerable to homelessness? Do you have any idea what it's like?
29. That isn't the problem the guy i'm replying to is worried about.
30. I’ve written about providing different tiers of housing for homeless people. 1. Provide safe, secure campsites with ammenities, similar to commercial camping grounds. 2. Provide more secure temporary accommodation similar to the ones provided to FIFO workers at camp sites. 3.Provide low-cost permanent social housing in already established areas, close to public transport and support services. In my enquires I’ve been informed that there a factory in CQ turning out prefab houses. I don’t know what the numbers are or if it’s just a trial. We need to do more. We can do more. We can do better.
31. And you're going to use the actions of the most desperate to justify cruelty without a transitional support plan? I think thats way out of line by schrinner and anybody who supports his actions here.
32. I'm not saying its up to BCC to fix the nation's housing issues, I'm referring to infrastructure and programs to support the Brisbane homeless population specifically, things the BCC already do, but clearly have a need for more of Tbf I live near Musgrave park and don't want the homeless community there either, but I'm not in the position to do something about it. I feel that simply shutting off the power and leaving them high and dry just makes things worse. If it's the same for the other parks then what's to stop them from trying to hijack power from a random business/ home
33. Housing is the responsibility of all levels of government as all levels contribute to the problem. You write about social contract. Well the council is at the coalface of the community-government point of contact. They receive funds from the State Government and they are able to raise funds directly via rates and fees. They in the ideal position to help the homeless. The fact they don’t, either unilaterally or in cooperation with the other tiers of government is a sad indictment of our communities. By. The way, councils do contribute to the problem. They choose to charge higher rates for rental properties., thus contributing to cost increase pressures on landlords. State Governments do the same thing by charging ever-increasing Land Tax and Stamp duties.
34. Cool story. I replied to basically the same thing here: https://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/1garr1b/comment/ltgaqqf/ Still yet to hear from anybody in this post about how disconnecting power and stopping them from cooking food helps anybody. Parks and zoning is absolutely in the local councils wheelhouse. They do have some responsibility here, there’s no easy solution… but being cruel isn’t it.
35. Not a fucking shred of empathy. Could have been a myriad of other solutions - here's one that doesn't involve removing an essential from a group of people already well under the bottom line and trying to survive: the BCC Critical Response Teams working with local community groups to provide these people with outdoor-rated extension leads and power boards (which are cents and pennies to BCC). But nah, let's just go straight for the artery and remove another thing that these people so desperately need in a first world country. Really, really, really bad take man. I hope you never have to experience what extended homelessness is like.
36. All good, I was busy [glorying homeless people](https://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/1garr1b/comment/ltgsmqr/) as you say 🙄
37. Social housing is a Government responsibility !! Therefore instead of blaming the LNP, go shove it to the ALP or does that not suit your viewpoint
38. I follow a person who does a lot to help the homeless of Brisbane and get them into this sort of shelter. He says that a lot of the people are musgrave have been offered hotel rooms etc but don’t want to abide by the rules so they go back there.
39. > Still yet to hear from anybody in this post about how disconnecting power and stopping them from cooking food helps anybody They disconnected the power as they were overloading the power in the bbq and causing fires, did you even read the article? "The council said a secure door underneath the barbecue had been broken into and people were using the power outlets inside to charge their phones and other devices. A council spokesperson said two recent fires in Musgrave Park had been caused by the outlets being overloaded, sparking safety concerns."
40. Council has defined powers and responsibilities, you don’t get to pick where your individual rates go. You get to vote & then the council gets to spend those rates within the bounds of their duties and the local government act.
41. Comment respectfully. Continued harassment may result in you being banned.
42. Uh... Council. The ALP isn't local government right now. However as the state government they ARE building social housing. It just took them forcing it through and overriding local government restrictions.
43. Yes, and the council is the local arm of the government which has presided over this power cut. Social housing is on them as much as atate and federal or did you just suddenly forget that the council is capable or doing something?
44. I understand that. In some cases people find themselves in that situation because of mental health issues and living in a hotel environment is probably not what they want or need. It can be very isolating and daunting with the rules of daily living.
45. Well, its clear either you were not born with the ability for perspective, compassion or empathy, regardless of what you keep telling yourself.
46. Yep. Cutting it off isn’t the solution. Recreational campsites can have outdoor outlets, done right they should have overload protection. Cutting them off means they can’t charge phones. Arranging appointments, getting support, contacting family and friends, job interviews, Centrelink support… all gets *really difficult* without a phone these days. This solution is lazy and cruel. I’m still yet to hear how cutting it off completely helps anybody.
47. No shit. I want homeless people supported, not inhumanly treated.
48. Not exactly true. Council has the ability to include ‘funding homelessness programmes’ if they so choose, in the same way they assist with street fairs and other entertainment activities. To keep the parks clean they could provide more bins emptied daily. They could provide portable toilets, portable showers, more power outlets, daily cleaning services. More can be done. It just requires coordination between different departments within council and State government.
49. Local government does not and has never provided social housing. It's 100% a state government responsibility.
50. Not forgetting at all, just pointing out that your thinking is politically skewed is all. Maybe you should push another agenda
51. oh well, if that's the best retort you can come up with ........ enjoy your weekend. Maybe you can go visit the Campers and have a discussion with some of them like I have. I can assure you, your eyes will be opened by the hardship, sad tales and the absolute gall of some who feel they deserve to get everything and give nothing in return.
52. It is the correct safety solution from a legislative duty of care position. Otherwise someone will get hurt. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
53. And voter and rate payer support. Representative democracy. One of the primary drivers behind having a LNP dominated council is that ratepayers want council money spent in their divisions, on themselves, not collecting their money and spending it on things like this, for non ratepayers. Most of the people in Musgrave have been offered shelter and short term accom at this point, but cannot stay because of drug and violence issues. Infinite chances does not scale with large populations. realistically many of them are now going to eventually end up in forced drug detox programs via prison. There are a few greens divisions that are more open to more of this type of spending, but if you’re the councillor for paddington, you still have to deal with the reality that you have two seats in council, nowhere near a majority, control none of the council chairs & while their division are supportive in theory, in reality they are still NIMBYs. Musgrave park is in Trina Massey’s division, who is a greens councillor. Trina is on the parks committee. Trina has plenty of recent pro Palestine posts, yet nothing about musgrave park. Because voters don’t want it. The hard left will continue to chant “we must do more, we must do more” for the rest of eternity, but realistically there are support services available, these are people intentionally choosing to live on the fringe.
54. Comment respectfully. Continued harassment may result in you being banned.
55. Haha yeah now I see why you can’t look up sources. You’re one of the people that says to do your own research and then types “why are the left so mean to me” in chatGPT.
56. It seems like you're dismissing my perspective by labeling it as politically skewed without addressing the actual points I’ve made. I’m open to hearing your reasoning, but it would be more constructive if we discuss the specifics instead of assuming agendas or biases.
57. It’s the easy/cheap solution. God forbid we aim above the bare fucking minimum for other humans.
58. Whether they are forced to live on the fringe or whether they choose their needs are the same; safe, secure accommodation with appropriate in place.probably more support for those choosing to live on the fringe.
59. Projecting isnt going to fix your lack of evidence dumbass.
60. Oh, now you have turned nasty, like a kindergarten kid that does not get their own way !!! Hahahha !!! and no, I don't believe you have spoken with them at all.
61. How do you provide safe, secure accommodation to people who make the accomodation unsafe due to their own mental health, drug and alcohol issues? You can’t cure these issues overnight. Many are probably generational trauma related and realistically are something that can be hopefully managed, not cured. You can’t just ignore it, then they infringe on the safety and peace for the other guests and employees of the shelters and hotels. Becomes an uninsurable nightmare. It’s also a great way to cause a UK style generational welfare trap, where you have 20%+ of London now council housing, that rapidly become slums & you punish people for trying or they will lose their council house. Jailing them seems like a terrible idea. Might detox from the drugs but creates new trauma. So what do you do? Let’s say I’m an active amphetamine user with a history of getting kicked out of shelters for stealing and violent outbursts. Where are you going to house me? I also refuse to not continue to use amphetamines, you can make it a condition that I can’t use them, but I have a long term addiction. I’m going to ride that glass Harley again, soon.
62. Well, continue your deflective rhetoric, I know you for the lazy slob you are. You won't change, you won't actually meet any of my points with anything cause you know, you have always had nothing. Sad. But true.
63. I’ve written and voiced my idea to provide safe and secure camping areas for those who want/ need that type of accommodation. For those who are able to live within a more formal setting, accommodation similar to the type provided at mining and other work camps would fit the bill ; that is Dongas that are fully self-contained or have shared laundry/toilet and kitchen facilities, or anything in between. The important thing is for the people to have their own safe sleeping and private space. The aim is to house the homeless until social housing numbers are sufficient to meet the needs of the community. However it needs to be a nationwide project otherwise people will just relocate to the state/s which provide the service.
64. I really don't understand your rambling ...... and continuing with nasty comments does nothing to promote anything you have to say. Lazy slob !! I have nothing !! what foolish words as you do not know me !! Best you go and have a nice night !
65. Ok so I come into your camp. Day one, I smoke up, smash my room to pieces and threaten to murder the guy next door while he sleeps for shouting at to shut up when I’m screaming my drug induced psychosis rant at 3am. It’s now 8am, you’ve turned up to work for the day. I’m only on day 2 of a binge, so I’m still in full fight mode. What happens now?
66. So, deflective. To the end. You had nothing. Wow. I knew it. It wouldn't matter if I did or didn't get emotional with the way you've been talking. Personal experiences do suck sometimes, such as being homeless. And for your information, I have been homeless before. I climbed the fuck out. But I know just how hard it can be, so don't service me with your empty platitudes "Uncle2Bart". Seriously, I can't stand your rhetoric. You're absolutely cunning about it too. I fucking hate dismissive douchebags like you.
67. What would have happened if what you’ve just outlined happened in a block of units or a regular suburban street or a hotel? I’m guessing someone would have called the police. The person would have been arrested and either taken to the watch house or to ED. Anyway what’s that got to do with providing safe accommodation for homeless people?
68. Because we have safe housing and the government and charities are fairly good at getting people into it. What they are not good at, is housing people with drug and mental health issues. We used to lock them up in asylums. Which was also a fairly terrible solution. Now they bounce between prison and Musgrave park until they do something to warrant long term incarceration. So roleplay it out. I get take to emergency. They will bounce me. Now do I go back to the shelter where I just threatened to murder someone and smashed up the place? You’re living in a fantasy land where this is an easily solvable problem, “just give them a bed to sleep in”. When it’s nowhere near that simple. The housing status is almost always a symptom of a much more complex issue to solve. Which is the same reason why they can’t stay with friends, family, etc. because guess what… when you’re a violent drug addict, people tend to not want you in their homes and you burn through all your relationships fast.
69. I agree with much of what you’ve written, I don’t live in a fantasy world. Far from it. You sound like someone who has either worked or known people with serious mental health issues. I’ve had / have close family members like that. One ended up living with my mother (another country). They made life hell for her last 20 years. Others caused marriage and family breakdowns. I’ve worked with people with serious mental health issues and understand the complexities. However NOT all homeless people fall into that category. Some are homeless for reasons other than their mental health, though long-term homelessness is a big factor in developing serious mental health issue’s. Yes the government and charities do have access to safe housing, but there’s enough to go around. It’s not just the obvious homeless in parks and under bridges, there’s the invisible ones couch surfing, living in cars or staying in emergency accommodation. Now that there’s a new state government that’s looking at making monetary savings I hope things don’t go backwards. The LNP are not known for their social justice programs. Just because the solution is hard it doesn’t mean that we stop trying.
70. Absolutely. And PSA: if you go to hospital we have a triage system which isn't a first come first serve situation. If you urgently need help, you'll get it.
71. If this is a government IT project it won’t even be done before the next election.
72. I mean, I actually think there are multiple solutions to emergency department wait times that would take strain off the emergency system overall in non life threatening situations. Non emergency 24/7 clinics, school district nurses, company based medical officers in large scale operations etc.
