Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. never stopped them building anywhere else in brisbane, it flooded there long before toombul was put in, thats why the airtrains up on bloody stilts.
2. Mate those are the objections of Greens councillors. At least the stated ones. LNP won’t care about that.
3. Infrastructure works at the scale of an Olympic venue can build up the land quite significantly, as well as shaping the geomorphology of the surrounding land to help mitigate risks. Folks need to remember that Sydney Olympic Park was built on reclaimed wetland in a lot of instances.
4. haha how hilarious would it be if the opening ceremony was flooded out though
5. Just build the stadium on stilts like a Qld’slander home
6. I have lived in the area for 15 years and let me say the flooding event that occurred in Feb 2022 was unlike anything I have ever seen in my lifetime. It was probably a 1 in 500 year event. The amount of rain that fell over that week was unlike anything I've ever seen in my life or probably ever will again. Anyway anyone who knows the area knows its no secret Kedron Brook occasionally breaks its banks but the water recedes quickly and it never once ever got close to the shopping centre. Building a stadium there and waterproofing the area is not a huge engineering feat in 2024. It would actually be a good solution to the problem.
7. ICAO are bringing in major changes to the OLS in the next few years, it's possible that the height restrictions could be lifted there- not likely in time for the stadium to be built, especially given how slow CASA is at adopting ICAO changes but could happen
8. You know the landing flight path goes right over the gateway bridge right? A stadium at Toombul would hardly be higher than the gateway. Not even close. So I doubt its an issue.
9. Thank you. I just want my Aldi and my Post Office back. Not some mega stadium shit-show.
10. Nundah has gone from a great subrub with heaps of amenities and services to an absolute isoalted shithole since Toombul closed. The woolworths carpark is a clusterfuck and the store now has so much demand that they are constantly sold out of products. Getting homewares is now an hour round trip to Chermside instead of the previous 10-15min trip to Toombul. We have lost a coles, an aldi, an eb games, a K-Mart, a bunch of reasturanuts and food court, a butchers, a fruit and veg market, banks, haridressers, cinema, multiple gyms ect ect and have had a population SURGE. Nundah is bursting at the seams with very little services to provide,.
11. The speed limit on Melton needs to be reduced to 40
12. I’d really appreciate a pet shop nearby, a discount store and a craft store. It would be hugely helpful. I also wish they’d put some shade on the walk to Nundah village it gets blisteringly hot in summer around Sandgate road and they cut down the only trees that offered a slither of shade Also a stadium would make everything really loud and bright and make scary drunk people come out
13. Yeah the Woolies in Nundah is an absolute joke, shelves are never stocked and extremely annoying carpark (pro tip, park underneath its easier). But agree with everything you say but it can be more than just a stadium at Toombul. Remember you can build up too. The whole site can have a stadium, a shopping centre, entertainment megacomplex. Its such a huge opportunity for the area and Brisbane itself. TOOMBUL is the first thing you see when travelling to the city from the airport. Its a very important site in terms of the image of the city.
14. Haha, exactly right? But seriously what's the first thing people see when getting a train or driving from the airport? Its Toombul. First impressions last. What an opportunity! To create and build an entertainment mega complex that will be the envy of Melbourne and Sydney.....and the world!
15. >The land is in the hands of private developers and is valuable. The new Government will probably love that 🤣
16. But are those private developers LNP donors…? If so they’ll probably get given double market rate for the land 😂
17. Its actually the perfect spot to showcase to the world. What's the first thing anyone see's when they leave BNE, they have to pass by Toombul whether by car or train. Its one of the first thing you see when come to Brisbane. First impressions last. Toombul is actually a very important site.
18. I'd be so much more enthusiastic about the Olympics if we could stage mock naval battles and gladiatorial bouts in the stadium. Might as well call it the Thunderdome, give it some local colour.
19. Big, shared resources like the stadium \*should\* be toward the centre of the city, it's exactly the best use of that prime location. For what it's worth, I don't understand why having the stadium near the airport is valuable. The number of people who will fly into the airport, go straight to the ground, watch the footy/cricket then fly home without staying the night is... miniscule. Raising the floor height for a massive, heavy 60k stadium is not trivial.
20. Raising the ground level would just increase flooding in surrounding areas wouldn't it?
21. Finally someone with a brain. Its not a difficult engineering feat to build a stadium there.
22. You know you cant actually get onto the airport link there right, the trainstation is aged and decrepit, the roads are above capacity and behind in their design by 20 plus years... yeah excellent location.
23. yep, I'm sure a cheering crowd is heaps worse than the 5 main motorways/roads intersecting the area.
24. As opposed to the airport (noise) and when the shopping centre was open/popular (traffic/lights)?
25. I also suggest that the Airport rail line, Sandgate Road and the roads associated with the Airport Link exit/East-West Arterial would probably be inside a security envelope for the stadium during the Olympics and likely would not be operational if a stadium was at the Toombul Site.

27. Say it with me, MEGA ENTERTAINMENT COMPLEX. Shops, housing, cinemas, supermarkets, a stadium. We can have it all!
28. Why not just encompass the space of Allan Border Field, they don't really need 2 cricket fields side by side on a site where you can't obstruct too much of the flood waters that flows over the Raceway?
29. The traffic is really only bad during peak hours and as a local I can tell you nothing is worse than the traffic near Westfield Chermside (Gympie Rd) at practically any time of the day. Sandgate Rd doesn't even come close to that shit show.
30. The area DESPERATELY needs a shopping centre back though. We don't want a freaking stadium
31. Its no worse than the Gabba or suncorp and actually with the tunnel link entrance right there, along with the train line its actually perfect.
32. Literally the shittest place to build one.. surrounded by 4 main roads.. That will make traffic fun
33. Finally, a forward thinker. Someone positive. If they can create man made islands in the middle of the ocean, fixing a minor flooding problem at Toombul would be a piece of cake.
34. This is not a plan. It was an initial vision, with no basis. There hasn’t even been an actual development application submitted yet
35. There's almost 8 years. Plenty of time, but yeah they need to get on it.
36. Yes for Jess Fox to win another Gold down Kedron Brook good idea!
37. Not an approved development yet, that’s why it’s just an application
38. Sure let me phone up my uncle at the BCC and get the details
39. Walking distance from Roma Street parklands and the CBD too.
40. There's a railway station right across the road. How is that hard to get to? There's problems with this idea, but transport isn't one of them.
41. Tell us how far away is Stade de France from Ile de la Cite?
42. Toombul was great for locals on the east side of the train tracks. Nundah is not great having to cross the one small bridge.
43. It's not just Nundah Village that needs expansion, the whole road infrastructure surrounding it is way too small and congested as is. The whole thing needs to be redone.
44. Fuck me, that comment simultaneously got *increasingly worse* and *more correct* as it went on. Well done.
45. Then when the next government has to finish the build so that it's not only on time for the Olympics, but also able to withstand flood and weather damage, Libs will campaign on how much they had to overspend to make it happen.
46. Well, they can build flood defences, build the stadium up above the flood plain, to be inline in the houses that don’t flood on the hill, plus it has direct access to the train network at toombul station
47. Wouldnt matter what fking goverment. Your kidding yourself if you think one party is any better than another. Its all about personal financial gain in australian politics.
48. That's a 1% AEP (1 in 100yr) river flood. Still not great but Toombul goes under in I believe 10% AEP (1 in 10 year) creek floods. Comparatively much much worse.
49. https://preview.redd.it/pfhotnn05exd1.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=512dd0a8711da1a0f5a4e534e6c6aba82579460b Just use the part that floods as the swimming pool.
50. Half of Brisbane was under water when that happened you goose. Toombul floods when someone sneezes
51. Yeah I agree: if they can make the bottom few levels a car park, or something less sensitive to water, then it could work.
52. Cant see them having a stadium where you would have to cancel major events or risk everyones cars being flooded every time it rains.
53. Why? Do you drive? because if you do, surely your aware of how traffic ques up all the way down sangate road both directions (without toombul) When it was operating it was a carpark. Imagine with 50,000 people added to the mix. The olympics happen while people work, itd be chaos.
54. The air train is newer than Toombul was. Toombul turned 50 years old in 2017. RIP 🖤
55. Wouldn’t that make more residential areas on the Northside have an increase likelihood of their house flooding? I can’t see it being popular.
56. > Anyway anyone who knows the area knows its no secret Kedron Brook occasionally breaks its banks but the water recedes quickly and it never once ever got close to the shopping centre The shopping centre flooded to a depth of about 30-40cm inside in 2011 and then flooded again to a greater depth in 2022. It's one of the most flood prone sites in Brisbane and is significantly impacted by both riverine and creek flooding.
57. exactly, and any idiot that knows the airport knows that no aircraft of significant size would be at a low enough level to be significant risk at toombul anyway. The runways are parallell and aproach is configured way before toombul. only the idiot pigs in choppers fly without lights and nav lights low. if they hapoen to end up wiping themselves out on a reinforced concrete building, oh well, sad waste of a great helicopter.
58. Even if the current regulations change, its pretty risky to build anything that would be as high as a stadium wound need to be.
59. We do have a post office across from Nundah Village but parking is far less convenient. I desperately wish we had another grocery store, Aldi is of course ideal due to the prices but even a Coles would be better than nothing. I occasionally walk to Woolworths if I don’t have a big shop or it’s not too hot. I tend to avoid driving there due to how much I hate the carpark, and I’ll go out of my way to Banyo or Ascot just to avoid it. With how many units keep being built in Nundah, and how car centric we still are, that Woolies can’t cope. Also the right turn lane right behind the turn lanes for Sandgate Road turns the area into a shit show between 3-6 PM most days.
60. You can have it all my friend and more. A 21st century entertainment mega complex!!! Its happening!!
61. Hey we still have gyms popping up on damn near every corner in Nundah, but agreed, we have little else and we're told to just "go to Chermside". I'm not going to the hassle of Chermside just to go to Kmart. Even though it was small, that Bunnings was great too. Hendra Hardware is too small, and sometimes I just can't be bothered to go to Virginia Bunnings.
62. I guess that's why real estate is booming there huh?
63. I always park on the bottom, I don't know why anyone parks in the surface spots. But the issue is getting to the bottom spots is a nightmare due to trying to navigate through the surface spots. People always parking in the loading zones, cars parked like shit so you can't drive two way traffic, nobody looking when they're backing out, people holding up the line trying to get in/out of spots. I tend to avoid driving there at all costs unless it's very late or very early.
64. “Many people are saying…”-type shit You made up this dumb idea. And yes it’s dumb, for all the reasons every other comment here has explained
65. Double? Think bigger my friend. We could go 10x and nobody could stop us!
66. Bus terminal built in already, train opposite, 100m from arterial tunnels and 2km from both international and domestic airports. How much better access do you need it to have bro?
67. I didn't get a reply lol They're probably not allowed to say..
68. I don't agree that it should be in the center. Eg Sydney Olympic Park isn't near the center. Sydney built and entire sports and entertainment precinct that works very well. But also neither is London Stadium, or Stade de France, or the Beijing Olympics Stadiums, or the Narendra Modi Stadium (the largest stadium in the world). The key thing is having accessible public transport. And as for people flying for events, they absolutely do. Because it's near the airport if you built an events complex, with restaurants and other nightlife venues, plus added hotels you will get a significant number of tourists coming in for those events. A Taylor Swift concert there for example would have a huge number of people flying in.
69. Yeah but those people with private jets to do exactly that have lots of influence.
70. Its also one of the first things you see when leaving the airport by car or rail. Its a very important site for the image of Brisbane itself.
71. You're increasing the height of the floor plate on pillars, not the height of the ground level. Effectively leaving flood water unimpeded. On a normal day, under the stadium would be a massive carpark, open on the sides. But at a time when flood was a risk, the gate to the carpark gets closed and if kedron brook does flood all that happens is water flows through the carpark underneath. It would have no effect on the operation of the stadium outside the loss of on site parking during the flooding event. Then after the flood you would just run through the space with a couple of bobcats to push the debris out and you're good to go. As for practically all you need to look at is how the airport rail line is constructed through that area. It's on pillars so that flood water can pass through without impacting the service.
72. The water there always recedes quickly like litterally within hours. Also that rain event in Feb 2022 was insane. Never seen anything like it in my life. Amost felt unnnatural. I doubt we'd see that again in our lifetime.
73. You can engineer anything but that doesn't mean you should. It's a problematic site with some major issues other than flooding.
74. Yes. You would build a new station on that line that was part of the development.
75. No lol absolutely not, there are much better and more convenient spots for a stadium, toombul is not that.
76. I don’t want that. It sounds loud, crowded and bright
77. I was thinking that it could be integrated and form part of a precinct of sporting facilities in the area. If you look at the areas around the MCG and Homebush, you'll see a number of redundant playing facilities. They can be used by lower levels and community sporting groups ordinarily, and serve as a temporary location for the big teams when the stadium is being used for something else. I would also envisage a lot more open space around the venue to handle the crowd of those big events. For big events, lots of marquees and food trucks. Between then, it is just green space which would handle flood events better than the industrial area that is there now.
78. Sounds like a shitty place to put for main roads to me.
79. The reason it floods as badly as it does is because it was created as a drainage canal system for places like Ascot and Clayfield that runs out to the Nudgee wetlands. So they could do anything realistically. From putting an actual drain in, to something out there like designing a reservoir or lock into the stadium's design.
80. 100% it's mad people thing that's a good idea. It would fuck up this city! I can't belive every olympic stadium post on reddit has people putting that as the best option.
81. Toombul and Nudgee are flood plains and flood prone. It's a ridiculous idea thinking something there would work bar lifting the whole area up 3 feet. I'm be doubtful this idea will even get past the here's a crazy idea group think stage. Cheers, C.
82. It will be approved. Certainly no way in hell a stadium will ever be built there, purely from a safety point of view. Edit: Wow, downvotes. Guess my 21 years of floodplain management means diddly squat.
83. Not as convenient as the Gabba where you can go in multiple directions on the train or bus. Anyone who is not Northside would have to catch the train back to the city then change.
84. I shouldn’t need to explain it. It needs to be central.
85. I humbly accept, and would like to give thanks to those who inspired me... Stephen King, Joe R Lansdale, and the Inventor of the word BLEAK. *
86. Your assessment of Australian politics is very valid! But I can jokingly criticise Coca Cola without having to list all the shit that's wrong with Pepsi, if you know what I mean?
87. I used to work at Toombul. Consistent heavy rain for 2 days is enough to make the bottom part of the site (which used to be car parks) flood. They could lift the site but given the amount of now expensive housing which would then flood instead I don’t think that will happen.
88. Toombul was always Brisbane's canary in the coal mine. It flooded before anything else.
89. True but I am assuming whatever the new development is - the flood level will be a carpark and whatever is being built will be above flood level
90. Funny part of the flooding at the old Toombul site, it had flooding earlier this year while they were doing the demo on the site.... 1 in 10 year events are closer to 1 in 5 at this point and 1 in 100 are getting closer to 1 in 50. There are sites that were built to only be effected by 1 in 100 year events that have gone under multiple times in the last 20 years. What ever gets built there needs stilts, yes there are still risks but at least the water course van flow.
91. Still a better swimming marathon site than the Seine was!
92. I used to say if two people took a wizz upstream of Toombul.it flooded.
93. The traffic on the surrounding streets is already a shit show, and there are two train stations including one immediately across from the site. Plus plenty of buses. I really don’t think there’s a benefit to bringing in a carpark except for flood mitigation purposes. If they had a shopping centre though, underground and parking below a raised centre would be good.
94. No reason that any event would be cancelled. Worst case scenario is that you would not have onsite parking during a flooding event, and you're going to know in advance that flooding is a possibility so you close the carpark early. There are heaps of public transport options there, and you really aren't going to want to encourage patrons to drive to major events anyway. Realistically on site carparking would be there for the other businesses that would exist there to have patrons able to park when event's weren't happening.
95. You obviously don't live in the area. In fact since the unprecedented event in Feb 2022, which is approx 3 years, the site has been essentially dry the whole time and Kedron Brook hasn't broken its banks once since then and if it did it was minor. The water always recedes very quickly there.
96. https://preview.redd.it/xmb3rvya5exd1.jpeg?width=1512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85f570ab502265e3dffc40e4d6f5544befb48b99 This was one of the streets down by Toombul in Feb 2022. I've lived near Toombul for 17 years. Kedron Brook becomes Kedron River at least once a year even without flooding to the rest of the city. Many of the northside of Brisbane's water ways feed into it. Displacing the water run in from Kedron Brook to anywhere surrounding will cause major issues for the residents to whom the water is displaced to. The physics of changing where water can flow causes 'on flow' affects that can be very difficult to manage or predict.
97. No, not if constructed properly. Drainage can be put underneath and around. Downstream can be modified to accept higher outflow. Upstream can be modified to shape water towards drainage. There are quite the number of options.
98. Ehhh, not necessarily. The height limitations aren't there for the flights that go as planned, they're there for the flights that don't. Depending on when an emergency occurs during a flight, its possible that an aircraft may indeed be flying on the very lowest levels of the OLS. If an aircraft is down an engine, or down to no engines at all, they need as much height as possible to attempt making the runway. A good recent example was the aircraft at Bankstown that made it back to land on a taxiway- barely. [bankstown](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/1d0wsmh/quite_possibly_the_closest_run_landing_ever/&ved=2ahUKEwi587jM0LCJAxWWrlYBHaDKLtYQjjh6BAgTEAE&usg=AOvVaw1bdaCrX7z9PwGOOLWRYnAe)
99. You don't have to tell me. Still better than ASA
100. I think if it infringes the current OLS, it won't be going there. However, with something as 'important' as the Olympics, it wouldn't be outside the realm of possibility that an exemption is granted for an infringement if it doesn't infringement certain surfaces. Personally, dont think it would happen, but who knows. I think the Olympics is a co.plwte waste of money, especially for a city like Brisbane- we've got better things to be spending our money on, like trying to improve our standing as Australia's worst city for traffic
101. Yea fair, there are gyms galore here. Just sucks because my gym is Anytime and now I have to go to Virginia which peak hour traffic sucks on sandgate road. Did try Goodlife for a few months, but I would rather sit in traffic then go to Goodlife!
102. The shopping centre is sadly missed no doubt. It was a huge blow to the area.
103. Realestate is booming evewhere in the South East Corner. Real estate prices are not indicative of services and amenities. Its indicative of massive population growth driven by interstate and overseas migration. Thats kind of my point. More people living and competing over fewer services.
104. Non locals park outside who don't know about underneath. I'll only park outside at night close to closing when its quiet. Otherwise if you park underneath right near the stairwell you're practically only metres from the entrance and 9/10 times you can find a spot there.
105. Sandgate Road completely at capacity especially because of increased turn off into nundah shops (due to lack of toombul shops), tiny side streets around it. School 300 metres up the road. Toombul station and parking is shit, it would also need to upgraded and more services.
106. Sure, but in that case, why does it matter that the \*stadium\* is near the airport? It matters that the stadium is near the other locations where people want to go on a weekend in the city, like restaurants and nightlife. And that's not Toombul.
107. Yes, but also no. I don't think any major city has great visuals on the airport link, given that the airport is usually in a crappy part of town.
108. The amount of debris that would go through the carpark would be a significant issue. It's fast flowing and happens even with the odd storm. They would need to engineer storm drains or similar to channel it safely underneath the stadium.
