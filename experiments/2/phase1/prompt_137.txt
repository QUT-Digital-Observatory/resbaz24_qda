Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. So an abusive partner can be given the right to abuse the pregnant partner AND a child further, by forcing the person to remain pregnant and probably later attempting to gain custody of the infant to repeat the cycle? Don't pretend there aren't "unintended" consequences to giving men the right to determine if someone else should end a pregnancy.
2. It does in regional areas... Areas like Townsville are clearly sensitive to economic pressures like covid and the post-pandemic rate increases. I'm a staunch labor voter but labor historically does not campaign very hard in Townsville. It messed up federal labor in 2019 and lost them 3 state seats this election. I pulled the juvenile offender data for queensland because I'm not naive enough to think the problems don't exist. Have a look at [Townsville LGA vs Brisbane LGA](https://imgur.com/a/6utBhmb). Juvenile offender rates have only dropped in the last 8-9months for Townsville which unfortunately makes the "crime wave" a fresh memory for many voters.
3. Great strategy. Have your media mouthpieces play up a fictional crisis. Then solve it by having the media stop reporting on it. Even if the LNP have a solid strategy to solve the problem, it will take a long period to implement it and to see results, but now that LNP is in, watch the media drop the whole "Youth Crime Crisis" topic like a hot potato. There will be an overnight change. A miracle.
4. I dunno, where I am it definitely existed for a while, a few cars stolen and torched every week, multiple houses broken into while people were home, but after they were arrested a few times that stopped. Since then the youth crime has been non existent. Disappointed in my area voting LNP but that's what happens when you have a large percentage that are conservative and religious unfortunately. Time for Qld to go backwards
5. Youth crime in the state as a whole has been trending down for a while now. Youth crime north and far north Queensland *is* out of control and has been trending upward. There is nuance to it.
6. In SEQ Which is why giggles got wiped out in Rockhampton and Mackay, to seats which Labor had held for over 100 years. Turns out when you ignore the problem and say "look at the statewide statistics, just ignore what's actually happening in your city" people aren't actually impressed. Crime rate is up in the regions, which is why comments like yours, reflective of Labor's poor attitude, are out of touch.
7. Tell that to the residents of Raby Bay…having to hire their own private security teams to drive the streets at night… but no that doesn’t fit the narrative does it??
8. to be fair, it was hard to choose between shaming scrunt about his body or his intellect, because both were in demonstrably poor shape.
9. That story sounded like such bullshit and Sheriff seemed like a loon. That said, the woman who accused Christian Porter was very similar to even her own family saying she was a loonie who made up stories all the time. The difference in coverage was pretty striking. A Shorten led government would be way better then the Albanesse rubbish we have now. The right faction of the labor party is full of good sensible people, the left faction has a large chunk of loonies who would be more at home in the greens party, though.
10. actually, it can very easily happen. the little germ needs to change legislation before he can adjust rates, that's all. because we only have one house there's not much stopping him from doing that, and given he had 30+ meetings with resource sector people over the last 8 months or so, I bet he's keen to get started on that.
11. BHP can leave. The resources won’t disappear. Mining companies don’t make anything, they sell the nation’s wealth and expect not to give anything back.
12. BHP isn't fleeing qld, they still make billions in profit..it's not like coal royalties make BHP somehow unviable in Qld 😅
13. > No wonder BHP is fleeing QLD Bahahahaha. Oh god this is a good one.
14. > No wonder BHP is fleeing QLD. Do you also believe colesworth are panicking over the thought of people boycotting them?
15. I doubt they are but if they did someone else would swoop in and take their spot.
16. yes, that's such a worry, as all the stuff in the ground that they were digging up will disappear when they stopping digging for it, hey? maybe they'll offshore the extraction of natural resources to an indian call centre?
17. I was saying that the right presents crime as a simpler issue than it is. more punishment = less crime. whereas in truth it's less about politics and more about widespread ignorance and negligence.
18. “People from the left have been statistically proven repeatedly to be more intelligent.” Do you have a link or source to that “proof”? “The “complicated truth” the right promotes is often full of bullshit, and anachronisms about the false ideology that “it was better in the old days...”” The only “complicated truth” is the left refuses to accept their own faults and seeks to blame anything else for electoral failures. “Humanity as a whole presses forward, social conservatism has a genetic factor, we don’t know what purpose it serves exactly but it revolves around fear of change and difference.” Cool story bro, do you have any scientific proof about this genetic factor? “Maybe if you were living in a cave 60thousand years ago it may have served a basic survival purpose.” While some prehistoric humans were cave dwellers, most were not. Some lived in constructed (but primitive) shelters. “We don’t live in caves, the world is generally safe, and you’re not going to be eaten by a saber tooth tiger walking out your door.” No, you’ll just have the possibility of been stabbed to death in a home invasion or struck by a stolen car while it’s being driven dangerously.
19. Well that is true! Yes that was the centerpiece ad for Labor.
20. Federal Labor is cooked mostly due to their unchecked immigration, also their establishment of 'special envoys'. State Labor was OK, but definitely tarred by their federal counterparts.
21. This so much, Qld Labor is BARELY center left pretty much only cause of the renewable policies.
22. If their next policy push was to lock the victims of DV in the same cell as the perpetrator until they "talk it out"; I wouldn't even be surprised anymore. Every policy I actually look into recently seems to be a bandaid fix that makes the overall problem worse in a couple years, and unmanageable for the next party to replace them. *I think both parties do this at a federal level.
23. You can think that all you want. Look at our federal results. Outside of Brisbane, LNP dominance
24. Brother, most of us lived through Newman, and this is literally Newmans ghost coming back to finish what he started.
25. It took me a couple of reads to get that you were being sarcastic.... 😬
26. The healthcare that will be needed is for when all the confused minors who thought they were trans need mental health support and physical care for their mutilated bodies.
27. I agree. Rapists and murderer's should get the death penalty. But the baby deserves bodily autonomy and the right to live.
28. What goes on up there has several layers to it. Some of it is linked to when the federal government handed over indigenous land rights to corporations in the western FNQ. Some of the land claims are questionable and possibly doctored claims, not all authentic. Part of it though took away the government's responsibility to provide essential services. The indigenous corporations now are responsible but no one is holding them accountable. So lack of services drives them into the regional centres. How say Doomadgee functions as a society to how Townsville functions is very different but some young people from out west are coming here thinking they entitled cause they seeing there entitled faux leaders taking government money, spending it irresponsibly and creating class issues that didn't exist before. The disillusioned are moving to the east coast because they have to (medical, court, centrelink, essentials) and they are moving in groups. If one person needs access to the Hospital up to 10 or people or more could move because of it. So that's a big part of what changed when crime spiked almost 10 years ago. Now compound that with the regional centres being a place where a lot of people still try to act as judge, jury and executioner and are happy to break the law if its suits them in some weird vigilante mindset. The class problems have just exacerbated. Now throw in a bunch of seasoned criminals watching the indigenous get away with what they are doing (because they could out the corruption in the corporations that the federal government would of had to answer to) and literally turned it into organised crime. There's some perceived gaps in our laws related to crimes with cars, those gaps are well intended factoring the nature of accidents operating a motor vehicle but these seasoned crims have worked it to make some of the offending hard to hold accountable. There's a lot of rumours you hear that don't get reported, mostly about sexual offences that occur along side the car thefts. Young girls getting raped etc but that's always been a troublesome issue on its own without it happening in the back of stolen cars. Another is of kids getting coached now but career criminals and these kids now aren't all the kids coming from country. These are bogan kids brought up in regional centres looking at how one group isn't being held accountable and a the root of it is the old government corruption, the pork barrel bastards strike again. The crime stats dropped in line with the introduction of the helicopter squad being able to still track offenders safely in real time. But long story short, LNP and police corruption are making it worse deliberately.. let them take the responsibility is the mindset I think ALP has taken. And there's also an element of some backward ass folk just being scum and retribution happens then they call foul on youth crime like they haven't been horrible first, which is a mostly the one time offenders bored on school holidays who end up in front of police and learn. So much racism up there it's sick. The place denser than a black hole.
29. And even then he’s walked back on decreasing crime in absolute terms
30. Honestly, I would love either side to clue onto this. I’m seemingly in a complete youth crime blind spot, I do not need it addressed here. Some pockets it’s a huge issue. Instead of saying ‘it’s a crisis!’ Which is an exaggeration or ‘it’s not a big deal’ which seems lacking in nuance… just acknowledge different communities need different things?
31. You've hit the nail on the head mate. This is exactly why.
32. I've been trying to search for region by region crime stats by year and I haven't found any, can you link to any?
33. Didn't see a single ad from anyone other than the LNP lol
34. They never said they were removing royalties, they said they’d look to remove the top tiers which are not currently being hit in any case.
35. Yeah like jobs. Playing for hospitals. Providing for remote communities. Paying your superannuation. Not sure if you actually understand the gravity of this.
36. It’s the non consultation that makes qld a big risk for investment. How long do these mines take to build and money involved. People are so short sighted it seems. Here is mate latest couple. https://www.mining.com/bhp-and-mitsubishi-close-4-1bn-sale-of-queensland-coal-mines/#:~:text=Daunia%20coal%20mine.,Whitehaven%20Coal%20for%20%244.1%20billion.
37. Have they not sold 4 odd mines since? Weird flex.
38. Yeah if you like having a declining standard of living sure.
39. Probably not a good faith statement, but I'll try. You must agree we need to mine some things; say Copper for solar panels, batteries etc. or sand for glass etc. Mining companies factor in political risk; like sudden changes to tax law before building a new mine. If you dont give them a stable enviroment they simply wont invest or build a new mine. Sometimes they also just sit on the mining rights for 20 or 30 years to see if things become stable. Happened all over the world. Also developing a project takes 10 years so you really need to start well before you need it.
40. Yeah they might. I think you’ll find who the better companies are to work for though… I’m thinking of the employees too. Mining is cyclical and the businesses plan on this… to take far more cream than is warranted from the biggest tax payer in the country is not the way to do it. Consultation was critical and unfortunately missed. I’m all for royalties but there is a balance.
41. Then just make it like 80-100% royalty? Stewth indeed, lol. Crazy amount of people on here have no idea how the real world operates.
42. If you're that conservative you're worried about being struck by a car, or having your home invaded which is statistically to say the least... improbable then I pity you.
43. With new endo and adeno diagnoses I am feeling pretty sad to know if I have any difficulty carrying I might face even more difficulty accessing health care. I clicked your link because that info would have been helpful… but I love what you did even more 😂
44. If you don’t have to time to inform with facts then don’t bother. ✌️
45. I'm hoping it will never be the case, but seeing what's gone on across the pond gives me pause for concern.
46. Yeah sarcasm is hard to read over text. It’s why I chucked the little /s doodad in there.
47. Been hearing that line for a decade now, surely we should be seeing these patients by the thousand already
48. So when a woman is experiencing a miscarriage at whatever stage... would you consider it an abortion to save her life by removing the dying foetus/embryo? Apparently many laws do - the example I have given happened to a woman in Ireland. She was refused treatment for the miscarriage because of the catholic ethos of the country/hospital/hospital staff. She ultimately died because she was refused life saving care. You say the baby deserves bodily autonomy before it is able to a) survive on its own and b) before it understands what bodily autonomy is, while believing the person who is pregnant does not have the right to exercise bodily autonomy, even when they may be dying or the pregnancy is not viable or may impact their future fertility...
49. The federal government has no power to hand over Indigenous land rights in a state, and who holds title to the land doesn’t change government’s service delivery responsibilities.
50. Honestly both sides are guilty of addressing the wrong things and that's most likely why the ALP didn't retain power
51. https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/queensland-crime-statistics/ Go to advanced, set to rates. You'll see at the state level it's trending down, kind of. Then look at Central, Far North, and North. All trending up, substantially. Then look at Brisbane and South Eastern. All trending down. This is the issue. Crime is up in the regions, and there are people right now that I'm having to inform of this. It's insane that even now there are die hard Labor supporters denying demonstrable facts.
52. That's not what you said, or what I replied, though. I was just pointing out that it requires legislative change which is really easy in Queensland with a majority government.
53. Queensland got nearly 8bn ***in a year*** from those royalties. And did you see a single earnings call from any of the fat ticks chewing on our soil take a hit? BHP's EBITDA was **$29 billion US dollars** **FY23-24**. ***That's nearly $44bn AUD.*** And you're licking their taint like they're some sort of philanthropic resource jesus? The line the trot out about jobs, and all the "good" they do in the community are carefully constructed to fool the stupid into supporting them against their best interests. fucking hell mate, pull your head out of ginas gaping arsehole and smell the roses
54. And if they leave they don't get our money and resources which is not easily replaceable. Also; nothing is stopping anybody from making a state owned mining company if we really wanted to. Sucking corporate dick is just a state own goal.
55. The resources are still in the ground for selling. If BHP wants to be a little bitch about it some other company can do it instead. Better yet a state run mining company, keep all the profits for QLD.
56. So they sold it to another company who will continue to dig coal out of the ground. continuing the royalty. Scare tactics., Bhp have divested many projects worldwide, BHP is acknowledging it has no future in the carbon emissions business.why they moved oil and gas into a partnership with woodside. It's way more complicated than royalties https://theconversation.com/bhps-offloading-of-oil-and-gas-assets-shows-the-global-market-has-turned-on-fossil-fuels-166336
57. And somebody bought the operation so clearly it's not going anywhere and somebody else sees value.
58. I've got a much better idea of how the real world in general, and resource sector operations in particular than you do champion.
59. Oh, I'm sorry my chicanery got your hopes up but glad you still appreciated it. I'm even more sorry that there's this uncertainty in the air for you with this issue. It's simply fucking outrageous that any of it is even in doubt. Fucking men in suits making laws that go against medical knowledge and advice, for women's bodies. The absolute fucking gall of politicians to think they know better than those practicing medicine in those fields of care and the pregnant person who will face the physical, mental, sociological and financial ramifications of that pregnancy. What does fucking Katter and the LNP lot who voted against decriminalising abortion know about medicine or even just facing pregnancy? How many times has Katter given birth or been pregnant. Fucking nepo hire from a long line of idiots.
60. I don't have time, that's right. I was courteous enough to give you a starting jump though.
61. What’s happening in the thousands is mostly young girls getting double mastectomies and in general minors being put on puberty blockers/cross-sex hormones. That number started wildly increasing from dozens to low thousands at every youth gender clinic in the country in 2020/21. All will need lifelong medical care for complications, botched surgeries, osteoporosis/menopause during one’s 20s, liver and kidney damage and heart failure. When gender clinics are forced to do patient followup, as I hope the LNP forces the Lady Cilento Children’s Hospital to do, we’ll see a direct causal link between these serious health problems and “trans healthcare”.
62. Cheers for giving a reasonable response, interesting data for sure. I wish they split out the youth crime though. I realise I forgot to mention I was after the youth crime data in my last comment. Although obviously the increased general crime rates outside of SEQ is an issue that we can't deny, I was curious if the data backed up the Youth Crime rhetoric that's been front and centre
63. They made $2B from coal.... you are looking at Iron Ore and Copper, but dont let the facts get in the way of your selfish beliefs... Hell I am all for the government/us creating our own resource company and having a crack. You live in a fantasy world. I can respect your opinion but please state facts not fiction. Edit: correction 1.9B USD so what like 3B AUD. Assuming like 2B AUD this FY due to selling down Duania and the others they co-owned.
64. I get it that people want something for nothing; that's human nature. The royalty issue is the rate is obscene and was without consultation. You can't expect private investment to make up for the public sectors blunders like CRR etc. Refer to WA's royalties and how they do it, its AAA+ and this is way miners flock there and why the state is going so well financially. Note WA did this under ALP leadership.
65. Your second point I’m 100% behind. First point I disagree with.
66. Champion? Ouch. I’d say not since you don’t seem to understand the risk the current royalties has imposed as demonstrated in your comment. But of course chuck in a champion and all is good. Wild times.
67. Everything I’ve read is all hear say…. Assuming now that all it is at the moment? Wish I had enough time to be so staunch on issues that aren’t even an issue. I’m with most of you here on your stance but I also don’t like to jump and shadows.
68. Sure. But I will remind you. The sun did come up this morning. And will tomorrow. Unlike many are making out to be.
69. Citation needed. For an obvious start, the ratio is still majority trans fems and under 18s don't get surgery
70. I'm not sure where youth crime data is by region. As someone who has had dealings with police due to being targeted by juveniles for several serious crimes, it is difficult to even find out information about your own case, as they do not give out information about the perpetrators, because they are juveniles. It made the insurance processes quite annoying, and the police said to not even bother with the fraud and financial crimes that had been committed. I would also greatly like to see regional crime stats by age group, but police don't seem to release that data, and the late government didn't publish regional data from what I could find either.
71. Nice work, champion. Yes, who the money comes from matters. My god, just take being wrong with dignity and grace. 🤡
72. You asked what the laws were, there's no hearsay. I'll break the issue down into digestible bites... KAP said all along he would seek to recriminalise abortion AND table a bill to reflect that. Under Labor, that would go nowhere with a majority as they had. This is why Labor could decriminalise it **6 years ago**. Under a LNP government, especially now with the differences in numbers, KAP tables his bill, LNP allow a conscience vote (because that's exactly what their party does) and Labor doesn't have the numbers to stop any changes. Now, after all of the outcry about that potential recriminalisation from citizens, KAP walked back their "promise" and said they'd seek to make changes (specifically to late term abortions - which already has an enormously strict criteria and absolutely is not the problem they purport it to be). So now we have Katter with 3 seats, adding to LNP's 47 (50 in total) and Labor with 29 (numbers taken from current count as at this moment (67.7% counted). 47 votes for a bill is the required majority to pass the bill. In 2018, 95% of the LNP voted to keep abortion as a criminal act when decriminalised was tabled... So even with a slim majority, if 95% go with how they voted before, BANG, the bill passes. Queensland has only one parliamentary chamber, which means that there is no house of review (or senate) like other states and Federal Parliament. This means that a Bill can become law without having to pass through the second chamber.
73. While we are throwing around false equivalences, the sun also came out during the holocaust. It also came out during the African famines, and during other terrible times in history as well.
74. Normally the champion throwers are the wrong. It’s somwhat subjective but you objectively quoted the figures wrong. Easy win. Cheers. You are coming off like you’re living off the governments feet. Wild flex indeed.
75. I just read the current law is "for any reason" you can terminate a pregnancy up to 22weeks. I remember seeing our kids on scans at 20ish weeks. I never realised that seems so unethical and well evil. Surely not many people would support an "any reason" stance anyways. Abortion is a huge complex topic but specifically if that is the law WOAH. Surely I'm reading that wrong or understanding it wrong.
76. To compare this morning to both of those times in history, absolutely sums up the hysteria. You really proved my point.
