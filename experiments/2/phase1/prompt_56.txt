Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. I'd like to see your sources. My asexual friend from Russia says that they are loving living and thriving in Russia.
2. Omg that place is a cesspool. I just assume everyone there is 15 though.
3. 50c was just to make sure people tap on and off for data collection. It’s essentially free public transport, which is a good fit for labour philosophy.
4. I'm sorry liberals and taking care of our weakest members of society don't match well in both state and federal i.e. robodebt, gutting ndis, cuts to healthcare services and selling state owned assets. And there's actually a track record when ranked Australia and the states are ranked higher in terms of economic management when labor is in power and drops very low when the LNP are in power. Unions having too much power might be a problem in some respects but it's better than a handful of billionaires getting taxpayer assets and money while they keep making money hand over fist
5. Uh, you literally don't even realise that my trans teenagers life is at stake here because of the hyper-fascist Christian inspired politics (pronoun bans, abortion, subsidised gender affirming care etc) that Crisafulli will be bringing in with his reign of terror.
6. 😂. God forbid having a different viewpoint on Reddit. ⬇️😂
7. >completely cut out administration support staff, earn big bucks My sister-in-law (now retired) was a nurse during the Newman cuts. They got rid of supply clerks, so the nurses then had to order supplies for the ward. Super efficient, right? 🙄
8. It is a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. Making it voluntary only erodes the effectiveness of the system while giving no upside benefit unless you want votes to be exhausted instead of counted entirely. It is absolutely self-serving, cynical and bad policy.
9. They also state they won't roll back abortion laws and we all know that's a flat out lie. The new premier is a hardcore Libertarian, the shittiest form of politician and human.
10. Are you being wilfully ignorant on what the RBA has actually said around this or do you just disagree with them? Bullock said that these temporary cost of living measures don’t even factor into the equation and will have a [disinflationary effect](https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/queensland-cash-splash-could-send-inflation-below-3pc-20240612-p5jl36). Leading economists have supported that view too.
11. Lol I think you mean to say, basic economic ideology. It’s not basic economics. The inflation we are seeing has is largely because of corporate and landlord profits, not because people are crazy rich. Suppressing spending on basic needs is a fucked idea. People living in poverty can barely keep a roof over their heads, pay for baby formula or pay electricity. If you really believe it’s just basic economics, I’d argue it’s time to redesign the economy.
12. The OECD has said this too. Australias government expenditure is simply too high. NDIS at federal level and cost of living relief at state level has made the RBA’s fight with inflation much harder. Downturns are horrible but Australia can’t really keep trying to avoid Economic gravity because we’re fundamentally not sophisticated enough to pull it off.
13. Provide proof then? We know cost of living is primarily coming from things outside of government control such as interest rates and corporate price gouging. The only argument to be made for the government being culpable in one area of cost of living issues is the housing situation. And we all know both major parties are equally to blame there. When did the RBA say that exactly? Because barely 2 months ago Bullock said she didn't believe government spending was fanning inflation and instead it was coming from consumer spending and China's slowdown.
14. I figured we were going to be good when we removed lead.
15. Except we happily elected Newman before any of them showed up and had Joh for however long, so perhaps the issue is in fact with us, and not some vague other that we can push the blame off to.
16. 🤔How's that work. You're saying if Labor got in my house would go down and the lnp getting in just means there's less chance of it going down? Cos I guess that's technically a win 😅
17. By the RBA's own admission government spending is not causing inflation to rise or stick around. Older generations without mortgages spending too much money and China's economic downturn are now the two largest factors in causing inflation to hang around.
18. So why aren’t my students ceasing engagement in youth crime? We feed them lunch every day but they keep stealing cars… It’s almost like the environment outside school is the issue…
19. >I do think it's disgusting of Labour to dangle it as a desperation move, they had nearly a decade to implement it Steven miles was premier for a decade?
20. Laughable from the rusted-on LNP sycophants who were going to win in a landslide two weeks ago. You lot really are pathetic.
21. It's really funny how mad you are that the people you hate aren't as sad and angry as you want them to be in your mind lmfao.
22. > not conceding last night He basically did, despite what your favourite outlets are saying this morning. He conceded that he wouldn't win, but it also wasn't clear that LNP would form a majority government by that stage.
23. Yeah all those socialist ideals from the 60s went out the window as soon as they got a bit of money.
24. Here, have this example - Right now in QLD, ambulances are free. Only one other state does that. It would be entirely unprofitable to operate a free ambulance service under private enterprise because it’s way too expensive. A good government just eats the cost because it’s seen as a function of public health providing utility to the people. A private outfit doesn’t give a fuck and makes you pay thousands for the privilege. Now apply that across other services and you’ll see the problem.
25. That's cool! People like to think competition will solve every problem and that might be true for, say, phones, but for government services there isn't money to be made unless the government bakes it into the contract for whoever is to provide it. There's just some things that are better done by government and government alone
26. It's actually worse than that. The public one will make you pay for a licence but actually check that you deserve it first. The private one may even be slightly cheaper, but they profit because checking is for losers and hey they're sure it'll be just fine handing them out like candy to anyone with money.
27. A 5 year licence costs in Queensland is $198. It’s $220 in NSW, $285 in SA and $228 in ACT. Victoria don’t issue 5 year licences but would likely be about $30 cheaper and WA is about $40 cheaper.
28. In an old life, I took a bunch of the most senior Telstra executive to the USA for meetings with the senior leaders of the company I worked for at the time. This is circa 1998/99. Telstra had spent billions putting fiber in the ground but wasn’t making it accessible to the public at reasonable prices. I asked one senior Telstra executive when they were going to make the broadband available. He replied “when we’re forced to”. I then asked why they had spent the money on the infrastructure if they weren’t going to make it available? He replied “to stop Optus from getting an advantage”. When Optus laid cable, Telstra laid cable next to it. The theory was that Optus wouldn’t be able to go live with a broadband service because they knew Telstra would just spend whatever money it took to crush them. At the time, Telstra was still partially publicly owned and it pissed me off knowing that Telstra was using taxpayer money to stop taxpayers from getting access to broadband. A few years later, another Telstra senior executive told me their internet strategy was to “kill the baby in its crib” - crushing any startup that looked like it might be a threat to Telstra’s effective monopoly. Again, using taxpayer money to stop taxpayers from getting access to services. A classic example of why privatisation of public utilities sucks.
29. I'm still on ADSL and I live in a major urban area. There is no plan to upgrade to fibre. I literally had faster internet in 1999, not even exaggerating.
30. You forget the 20 million dollar annual income just for the CEO like Qantas, then ask the taxpayers for a bailout when shit hits the fan while unfairly sacking 1700 employees.
31. We get what we deserve. No hope for our future from here. Glad we are doomed to repeat a ten year repair cycle from here of a 1 term LNP term = 3/4 terms of fixing the damage by labour to just repeat rhe same. Get out while you can from Australia. Genuinely the most disappointed I've been my country for years.
32. The busses are owned by Brisbane City Council, not the State Government.
33. Privately contracted bus roots doesn't result in 10x fares like Jesus Christ as someone who follows public transport really shits me off when people make this dumb claim. Having private bus operators doesn't mean they get to set the fares or else we'd aleady have 10x fares on the Gold coast (Kinteic) Redland (transit systems ) or literally any other bus region that's not run by tfb.
34. I will be messaging you in 1 year on [**2025-10-26 15:05:50 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2025-10-26%2015:05:50%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/1gclq71/qld_decides_david_crisafulli_to_lead_majority_lnp/ltuyp0e/?context=3) [**13 OTHERS CLICKED THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fbrisbane%2Fcomments%2F1gclq71%2Fqld_decides_david_crisafulli_to_lead_majority_lnp%2Fltuyp0e%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202025-10-26%2015%3A05%3A50%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam. ^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%201gclq71) ***** |[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)| |-|-|-|-|
35. That's a bot command? That is cool as hell I'ma try doing it too
36. Show me a single LNP sell off that has resulted in a positive outcome for the consumers.
37. They won’t stay past the original 6 month trial, I reckon. Come March, they’ll have fucked them off.
38. Hi, just ask anyone from Townsville about their time with Crisafulli :))))))))))
39. The whole point of determining who to vote for is speculating about hypotheticals.
40. Like how about we see how bad a thermo-nuclear bomb exploding is before we get too worried about nuclear weapons. It might not be quite as bad as all the wowsers keep complaining it’ll be…. /s
41. Yeah that pesky surplus we have had needs to be fixed.
42. It's so important Tony Abbott got in on a budget emergency. Then tripled the deficit BEFORE COVID.
43. Yeah it is important which is why the ALP has been doing a great job while the morons in the LNP couldn’t run a federal budget surplus for over a decade.
44. If I recall correctly, it isn’t the Libs delivering record year-on-year surpluses. But whatever makes yourself feel better.
45. Have you checked the books recently? Or can't you count that high to see how good they've been?
46. Can’t believe they actually tried to say that. They even said tonight that miners will “return to Queensland”. It almost like they dig where the resources are hey 🤔
47. But that long history was a long time ago. This is only the second time in nearly 40 years that LNP have won
48. There has already been talk of an abortion reform hitting the floor first thing but ok. Be dumb I guess.
49. I agree, but the two party system is very much alive, especially when the media promoted this by only featuring ALP and LNP.
50. Yea so funny to see labour voters crying about cost of living/housing when its literally been all their government importing millions of people faster than tradies can pop up extremely rushed housing complexes, 1 million Indians in the last year and a bit, and Indians now buying 32% of property compared to Australians at 22%, these numbers are already shocking and do not bode well for the future of the country escaping becoming Mumbai
51. The Fuck you on about. Must be at least 60 to be a boomer. And pretty sure qld has been Labor since 1989 (except about 5 years) so those old folks must have been voting Labor then. Brisbane is almost entirely Labor seats to. It's more about where you live than your age.
52. You need the one that looks back to the last time he was a Minister, where they did essentially the same thing with other promises. The costings indicate debt or slash, and LNP campaign in other people's debt so they opt for slash usually.
53. We will soon know whether that was the right choice or not…
54. Sydney only had 7 years from announcement to the opening ceremony and did it well. We can do it.
55. "You wouldn't know her. She goes to another Russia." For the very slim chance that you're not being obtuse: [https://www.ilga-europe.org/report/rainbow-europe-2023/](https://www.ilga-europe.org/report/rainbow-europe-2023/)
56. Your child's life is not at risk, everything will be okay, I can assure you.
57. So efficient. Oh, don't forget the Nursing Prac students now expected to assist in actual treatment of patients without official qualifications, no pay and absolutely no proper training. Partner was a Prac in Newman years, she was used as just another nurse and given access to things she shouldn't have been allowed to even remotely be near without supervision. I guess we have a "short (one) term" memory problem
58. I agree that it's bad policy. But it's not as consequential as throwing away billions of dollars a year
59. Because every government is attempting to fix this issue. Labor had plans in place to try slowly fix it. LNP now have the choice to double down and speed it up or destroy the progress Ultimately no matter what happens tho it should go down a fair bit even if LNP slow its progress ALOT
60. Ahh yes. Government Spending is special money and doesn't contribute to inflation.
61. Free lunch provides every child with food. Children without food are from poor families so the policy would directly affect the bottom % of people. Depending on how they did it, it could also eliminate bullying of the poor% (like if they just literally give every kid the same lunch, bullying is gone) This is a starting point, but it would help that kid stop lashing out/foghting/being outcast and then going into the gangs and whatnot. It’s environmental you’re right, and making children feel safe and not hungry helps with that. No one just steals a car, it starts from somewhere and I would argue that it could have started from them stealing food.
62. Not to mention as shown in data breaches in Vic and NSW often their data systems are more susceptible to attacks because a quick way to save money is not spend it on the additional security layers.
63. LNP shills and making shit up. Name a more iconic duo.
64. You didn’t. You weren’t doing the same things on the internet in 1999.
65. Most disappointed since Abbot won. It's like waking with a feeling of dread and impending doom about the future.
66. Fares and routes are set by TransLink who then fund operators
67. Ohh well my Sunshine Coast $0.50 fares will be fine then /s
68. Is be better convinced of your expertise in public transport planning if you could spell “route” correctly. The reason fares on the GC or other places with private operators are not 10x higher is that TransLink set the fares across SE QLD. We suffer by having very limited services anywhere that the private companies cannot make money. That forces more people into private cars and means more traffic - contributing to the gridlock we are experiencing.
69. > Privately contracted bus roots doesn't result in 10x fares like Jesus Christ as someone who follows public transport really shits me off when people make this dumb claim. Then you've clearly never had to take a bus or coach to somewhere rural, and have only had experience with private bus routes within cities.
70. Sure, but people are getting themselves worked up and blaming them for removing 50c fares already, when all evidence points to them just keeping it. If they had the intention to remove them, they would have been less specific with their commitment prior to the election so it didn't damage them as much when they performed the U turn. Of course, they MIGHT suddenly change course and piss off the electorate, but I'm not sure why everyone is piling on about a thing that may or may not even happen. Just an emotional evening for some, I think.
71. Yeah you're right, having to pay 3 bucks instead of 50 cents is definitely on par with people being killed by weapons of mass destruction.
72. The books are looking good across the country on the back of the high inflation and interest rates, higher costs = more tax going into the coffers. If the government gave a crap about inflation they would remove fuel excise to lower transport costs and force industries to pass the savings on. Higher interest rates only help the government and banks profits and have proven to do very little to affect inflation.
73. Bro is fuckin silent on this one. No replies to anyone.
74. Strange how that works. At the time it was almost like they expected us to think they’d start mining QLD coal right through the face of earth from China or similar in some diabolical scheme to avoid the resource tax.\ Yet they stay, they mined and they still mare millions, paid they shareholders, paid their executives annnnnd still paid the higher tax to compensate the people.
75. Ww2 expert here and wasn't even there. I didn't know intergenerational trauma worked that way.
76. By whom exactly? Happy to be dumb. See you in a year and we can check in.
77. Mate I’m Indian, am a citizen and have been here for 20 years. 1 million Indians? You are fcked in the head…where are your numbers from? Why not just admit when you see us it makes you mad? Hard to believe we are in 2024 some days
78. The housing shortage is a decades (and longer) problem - and a federal level issue. Look back at Shortens' housing plan and tell me it couldn't have made a massive difference today if implemented then. What is needed is probably some combination of addressing stressors on the private supply- like regulating AirBNB, increasing public supply through public housing, and policies which look at zoning, tax structures, and a whole host of other things. What we'll get under LNP is probably a reduction to public housing, letting the private sector go untouched, and increased buyers grants which just prop up demand further.
79. Never said they were Boomers. Also median age is higher in regional areas. But I agree with you, young adults living in regional areas are more likely to vote conservative as well.
80. But according to Reddit there are no costings and no plan or are we still looking backward?
81. Sounds like cope mate. My comment was just in jest. There's no way this baby's going down after it's already gone up 100k in less than a year and there's rate cuts on the horizon 😂
82. It does, only when there is too much of it. Which there isn't right now.
83. Again we feed every child lunch that wants it. Have done for a few years. Hasn’t stopped the kids engaging in youth crime. Hasn’t even stopped them being verbally abusive to the people giving them food. I mean, most of them just truant and go downtown and steal the food they want instead of the food provided. Because the pull of home is far too strong. The culture of home is far too strong.
84. Bless your little bleeding heart, I am sure you mean well. Provide free/subsidised meals for those who need it. If you do it for everyone, it will just mean those savings bid up prices elsewhere in the economy.
85. No, I actually did. My cable internet in circa 1999-2000 was around 40 mbit. I've never hit 40 on my shitty ADSL plan that I'm currently on. As for my internet selection, i wasn't doing much steaming back then, because it didn't really exist, but I was doing more gaming (because I was a huge nerd)
86. Agreed & the bus most people ride on (Brisbane City Council area) are owned & operated by the council. The person I replied to suggested the LNPs mates would be purchasing buses on the cheap…makes no sense.
87. I believe so as the LNP said they’d keep them.
88. Almost a certainty that now they are in with a majority, all of their "promises" will be ripped apart early so they have 3+ years for people to forget, like what happened with Newman.
89. It cost me $13 a day to get into the city before 50c fares. That’s $65 a week. $130 a fortnight. Which equates to just under 15% of my income after paying rent. To PUBLIC transport.
90. The German government temporarily removed a 30c tax on fuel in May 2022. Surprise surprise wouldn't you know it the fuel companies found excuses to put prices up by a bit less than 30 cents within two months. The only difference was instead of that money going to the government it went to the fuel companies, and then the price of fuel jumped again when the tax was introduced. I'm quite sure the same would happen in Australia, and all the fuel companies will say "well people were able to pay that before, so let's just charge them that anyway!"
91. Ah yes, tax cuts for businesses, they are after all so well known for passing savings on to consumers.
92. WE KNOW ITS ABOUT SENDING A MESSAGE change their stance federally or the same will happen at the federal election.
93. My point is 40 is no where near a boomer. 40 is millennial. The youngest millennial are closer to generation alpha (some of which haven't been born yet) than a 40 yo to a boomer. Millennial is current 28-43yo's. I'm guessing you're z? And pretty much every gen x and millennial I know is worried for you guys and supports policies that would make life better, or give opportunities, z and alpha are our children and we want good things for you
94. You're failing in your sarcasm because you're talking to someone who reads. If you haven't read what you voted for, it's not on me to educate you.
95. Well if QLD becomes a less desirable place to live due to LNP policies, people leave and less come to live here and the price of your house tanks
96. There are considerable numbers of people who want to leave the state depending on the outcome of abortion access. That means less demand on the QLD side and lower house valuation.
97. If you change the conversation from “feed anyone who wants it (and you say gets berated for it) to give it to everyone regardless” it changes it drastically. It’s the exact same thing with school uniforms. Poor families can’t afford new nikes and whatever so enforcing a school uniform directly helps the poorer kids from bullying etc. Anyway I was for and you’re against. Let’s leave it at that.
98. We saw it here with the QLD 8 centre rebate, no need to wonder, we wouldn't see any of it
99. Then the government taxes every ship that ports to the hilt and passes that on. There are fixes, fuel companies in Australia have very little power, they are retail only as we have closed almost all our refineries, I think there’s only 4 left? 4 refineries in the whole country that completely relies on fuel to transport everything. We bring everything in so the government can force companies to play the game. Just no one has the balls to do it.
100. The government has powers to force things to happen, just no one has the balls to do it. Even if the government don’t, the buyers can. People aren’t dumb, if fuel goes down but prices stay high then vote with your wallet and buy elsewhere. Big tip, don’t shop anywhere that has shareholders. Profits will always take precedence over anything else because the share price is all that matters.
101. >ITS ABOUT SENDING A MESSAGE DOES YOUR EMAIL NOT WORK!?
102. Literally the most brain dead take I’ve read on here. Way to cut off your nose to spite your face
103. Oh yeah, that will work. They’re super afraid of you and your ignorance about how the government actually works. 🙄
104. Again, never said they were Boomers, or even boomerish. Just pointing out the median age was over 40, so half the people are older than that. Take away all the kids and the median voting age would get closer to 50. From my anecdotal experience it's around 60 that some people start struggling with critical thinking and being easily swayed by media(mainstream or social). Which will be close to 1/3 of the voting bloc (though who knows what % of them have a significant conservative bias) And age is only one of the issues which sway people conservative. Location, religion, education are all big factors as well.
105. You may be able to read but unfortunately it seems comprehension is out of your reach.
106. Can you honestly see the amount of people leaving qlders over access to abortion would be so high that it would drop property prices? I can't see that..not at all..
