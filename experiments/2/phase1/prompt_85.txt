Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. reproductive rights the nuance is simple - its only the person who needs to go thru that nightmare of least bad choices who is qualified to make a choice so the law as it is is good, gotta remember the old saying there but for the grace of god go i LNP isnt gonna give us nuclear power either state or fed level sadly and tbh our need for nuclear power in order to enable large scale desalination, indoor agriculture and ecological restoration efforts on any meaningful scale without "culling the masses" is kinda exactly why we need to nationalise the grid cos we dont rlly wanna get plant operators cheaping out on maintenance and shit and we're sick of being rorted by power companies, unluckily (or luckily depending on your perspective) something as controversial as a nuclear power program wont be accepted without such a massive compromise as nationalisation in exchange uhh and if youre concerned with the unsustainable monopoly of violence then plz keep in mind that it was Howard the Coward and his LNP responsible for civilian disarmament in the 1990s and plz do yourself a favour and check out Paul Birch's essays on the right to bear arms and mutual defence, suffice it to say i dont want a carbon copy of the 2nd amendment but i do want a proper bill of rights *with* an accompanying bill of responsibilities like yea we definitely need the right to self defence back but its gotta come with social responsibility (which honestly i dont even trust from most cops) also youre too young to vape dummy but low key agree Greg cHunt rlly screwed the pooch when LNP imposed the first round of vape restrictions way back when which caused the flood of cheap dispos like iGets in the first place do yourself a favour ask your mum to get a script and stick to like a Caliburn or an Xros there are online pharmacies its safer than trusting the dodgy dispos dude plz anyways idk i probs cant convince you to put LNP last but like trust me they wont make life any better for you in the long run and probs not in the short run either
2. So your reason to vote LNP is because you want guns, nuclear energy and nicotine sold to minors? And small limited government? I mean shit at this stage, just vote One Nation, go in the green card lottery and be done with it.
3. If you wanna live in America so bad then go move mate. What's the old saying - "if you don't love it, leave it".
4. Small government/reducing "red tape" is a complete fallacy, as privatisation just shifts this beauracracy into private business, but with more corner cutting and less profits flowing back into the public. Businesses often have some of the worst beauracracy around, especially those taking over public sectors. The results of shifting to 'small governance' can be seen in the US and other countries where they have forced this economic system by force - the results are great for fat cats on company boards and their politician friends, but absolutely abysmal for the functioning of society and those trying to navigate the private sector hell. It doesn't require nuance to see that the LNP (qld resources council) are the worst people to put in charge of reproductive rights, and anything else for that matter. What they want to achieve is better returns for them and their mining sector friends while cutting the services many Queenslanders rely on, because apparently we should not be adequately reimbursed for all the rocks they dig up and immediately flog off to Japan/China/India while destroying large swathes of our environment. Also the freedom for you to suck on a Chinese-made, blueberry flavoured formaldehyde rip stick is not something too high up on my priority list given the aforementioned points.
5. I told them that the only new policy is the abolition of the coal royalties, and how they are the reason Labor can afford such COL relief. Annoyingly, one of their gripes has to do with the Gabba, as they are pro-rebuild and they feel that Labor’s Olympic plan is sub- par.
6. I am so confused as this is incredibly uncharacteristic of them. They have said that they don’t like Crisafooli, yet for some reason they seem to be in the ‘we need to change government to make Labor feel motivated’ camp.
7. Long story short is that it's a guess. The take a very small sample and extrapolate it to fit the nation. E.g. 60 out of 100 said LNP so they assume 60% of Australia will do the same
8. To answer your question: At least with phone sampling it is considered a type of random sampling. That is, the phone numbers are from a massive list and randomly pulled until rejection or completion, so there is less sample bias. Although, it is usually stratified by demographics (I.e., will randomly sampled from within a certain electorate and age group until quotas are filled). However, with the news poll in question, from what I can tell they used a sample of convenience. They sent out surveys to their own mailing list (email) until quotas were filled. The people on the list were thus convenient because they already had easy access (mailing list), and more problematically they had previous contact with the group of people. The problem with this—the issue of sampling choice impacting results, as illustrated in my other comment—is more problematic with this sampling method. You can imagine how someone who has participated in previous paid research or has hopes to be part of paid research again may influence their choice to participate. Moreover, the kinds of people on the mailing list may not be reflective of the general population. Most people do not participate in market research, so people who do may be more knowledgeable and engaged with the process. Thus, the results are only reflective of their own mailing list—people who have participated in market research before. The company obviously tries to weight data by certain features, but they cannot weight it based on response bias due to not being eligible to be sampled. I could go on, but I think the point is salient here. Point is, take it with a grain of salt. Politics is divisive, and most people do not engage with politics. For instance, some people always vote a certain party because that's what they have always done, or their partner/family has done. Others vote based on what is going on for them that year. I think quite a decent proportion of the population who are more iffy or will swing aren't as well captured in these surveys anyways.
9. I agree, and ideally you'd want a party more in the mould of what the Australian Democrats used to be. And ironically it's the Australian Democrats that show that these smaller right wing parties in Queensland may not survive on their own politically after their founders have passed away.
10. Because the vote isn't like that. It's more like a 'top ten' list you see online. You might not have much splitting the anti-nonwhite party and the pro-hit-kids-with-katanas party (sad that both of these exist this election), but they have to sit somewhere on the list relative to each other, even if both are solidly "hell no", and not winning your electorate. It's important more where the "bankrupt the state to build stuff", "shh, trust us, we won't be corrupt" and "shhh, we weren't corrupt, trust us" parties are all similarly popular, and how you sort the "build all the things", "not corrupt, promise" and "learned our lesson, promise" parties affects which one is least hated. (In other parts of the state, it might be a race between the "not corrupts" and "hit your kid with stuff" party, and the votes from one not corrupt, promise party get the kid hitters in, because the two promise parties hate each other.) Otherwise, if you vote for someone you don't think will win, and fail to preference someone who does, your vote can't be allocated in the final run-off (for better or worse).
11. Its ironic that you're calling it stupid when you choose what numbers you write, just put one number.
12. Yea that dungeon is how I think Crisafulli views this state. So i found an image of it online to put here
13. Can't tell that to the boomers on Facebook. Those idiots can't see the forest for the trees.
14. If it was your home being broken in to you may have a different opinion.
15. You can, but even the LNP thinks they went too far down the multinational consultancy accounting route, to the point the government doesn't know things and has to trust KPMG or EY to tell them if KPMG or EY did a good job. Weirdly, KPMG says yes, even if they didn't actually do anything (and bills hundreds of millions of dollars for not doing it). Who woulda thought?
16. A child, they want vapes to be available to everyone and complain that they aren't available to under 18s, only reason that would be a problem for them is if they are under 18. Probably some CoD playing kid with a nicotine addiction with no understanding of politics. No understanding why firearms are restricted or that you can actually own firearms if you pass the requirements. And no understanding why nicotine products are not available to children and why they shouldn't.
17. Check out their active communities. More than 50% have the word “Christian”. That explains enough to me.
18. How exactly do they think that rebuild will be funded? U just told them everything they are scrapping are key incomes for the state already 🤦 Then bring in the other 'policies' and fill in the gaps. Connect it to them personally in some way. I know that can be hard I don't know ur fams personal circumstances. Unfortunately, it also is a generational thing 🤷
19. That's incredibly frustrating and I hope they see what Miles has done and that the cost of living will absolutely go up under Crisafuckwit
20. Crime happens everywhere mate. I got robbed, was uninsured for contents and had thousands of dollars worth of musical instruments and equipment taken. One thing I didn’t do was blame the state government or local children. I copped it on the chin, such is life
21. Kids broke into my house and stole my cars. The LNP doesn’t give a shit any more than Labor did
22. Yeah, I mean.. this entire paragraph was implied in my rhetorical question, but thank you anyway for genuinely trying to give an answer.
23. My parents were born in the 70s, and my dad didn’t move to QLD until the late 90s, otherwise I’d reference Joh, but they don’t really remember much of how he ruined our state.
24. I used those numbers for an example, I know it's larger than that but it's not 24 million, might be a few thousand. And it's not hard to maintain some sort of accuracy when you have a 50/50 chance of getting it right. LNP have been favourites since the start of year so ofcourse the news would say they would win....however it you believe the same news articles, labour is now favourite as of last night. 🤷‍♂️ who is right?
25. > Most pollsters don't call landlines. Last I checked, phone polls included mobiles and landlines (mobiles being more heavily weighted). Bigger polls conducted maybe once or twice an election cycle might use phones. > That's not how majority of the current polling firms... > Most polls are online using market research panels... These are contradictory statements. I read the YouGov methodology for the Australian's newspoll. So this last statement is exactly what I'm referring to, when I say it's a sample of convienence (using mailing lists), and mainly reflective of those who participate in market research with the relevant company conducting the poll.
26. Yeah, but your not letting feelings get in the way of facts, duh
27. Anytime. I'm nothing if not known for occasionally missing rhetorical questions.
28. Hey man, we all do, that's why I tried not to be rude. I missed one last night and I've still got a Real Smart Guy™ trying to convince me I'm a dumbass 🤷
29. > ...what relevance? To illustrate two different companies who have conducted newspoll do the very thing I'm describing. For example: > *Source of online sample: Selected from previously recruited online panels of research participants to fill quotas loosely based on weighting frame and past vote* Current Pyxis: https://www.pyxispolling.com/ws/media-library/73b9d7f814724d1daf342eaf252b46d3/newspoll-methodology-statement-14-october-2024-by-pyxis.pdf AND, whilst older (2022) same from YouGov: https://origin.go.theaustralian.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/220413-Public-Polling-Methodology-Statement.pdf Thus, my point stands. If you want a more detailed description of why samples of convienence can be problematic refer to google; plenty of awesome illustrations.
30. No worries. Statistics is not an intuitive thing, and sometimes it feels like it's purposely and needlessly confusing. I only understand this stuff because I've spent nearly a decade engaged with it.
31. My family always hands out how to vote cards and we all know how little impact that has. During COVID each party was allowed one card taped to the polling booth. That was so much easier, cheaper and less wasteful for everyone involved. I would like to see that become the standard
32. I walk passed all the people handing out the how to vote cards because I already know how I will vote and they are just a waste.
33. Tbh how many people take HTV, isnt any indication of how an election is going. I have worked at several elections also. Most people don't want to waste the paper and they know who will be 1 box. As for the other boxes, most of us wing it ... but HTV *is useful* in a tight election Totally agree some election workers / volunteers are really childish
34. Not sure where everyone is voting but my early voting centre was fine. Labour and Greens where chatting. LNP was chatting with Labour, I just said “Im good” when I walked past and they left me alone. The only thing I found a bit annoying is when they asked me if I knew how to vote…. Im 30 and have been voting for 12 years… I know how it works
35. I'm also in Brisbane and have had the exact opposite experience. The Greens have had about 6 official warnings from the returning officer to yelling over the Labor candidate and harassing voters. We've had Greens volunteers directed to follow the ALP candidate around to interrupt conversations with voters, stand in front of a frames to block them, and yell at Labor volunteers. Edit: I'm blown away this is getting downvoted lol. Apparently bullying is bad when the ALP does it but okay when the Greens do? What a sad state of affairs we live in.
36. All that paper on how to vote 🗳️ when it all goes in the bin. Plus in the letterbox and it goes in the bin.
37. Don't vote for LNP, unless you want our state to be stuffed again.
38. Everyone regardless of party please remember this is the internet and people could be lying.
39. Be nice if we end up with a progressive Greens govt.
40. I had no issues with Labor, but I did early vote at king george Square and had an LNP htv lady shout at me "don't waste your vote!" When I grabbed a greens htv card. Nearly yelled back at her to mind her own damn business. Handing out cards is fine but how dare these people shout at voters. At best she was shouting at a member of the public, at worst she was trying to confuse a voter about how voting works (how can I waste a vote in a ranked choice voting environment?). Either way it is not acceptable.
41. \>I think Liberal will overall win National. Well, the 'Liberal Nationals' but Nationals none the less. The Nationals are the primary conservative force in Queensland. Merging with the Liberals was their best attempt at seeming palatable to the wider urbanised electorate.
42. Yeah the childishness is disappointing. Up there with taking away women’s health rights and decisions, giving the royalties back to…Canavan’s brother and his mates and losing the cheap PT fares but fuck those volunteers.
43. Anecdotal, but in my area the Labor signs were vandalised. The LNP candidate sign was put up and the Labor sign was ripped off.
44. I’m firmly on the right for most issues. But not voting LNP this year due to their stance on pill testing. No chance im voting labor lol But, I feel LNP will win, even after the “abortion” propaganda.
45. yep, pathetic how both sides of the coin are tarnished.
46. Labor volunteers were too preoccupied having a chat amongst themselves to even notice me walking in and therefore didn’t bother to offer a how to vote card. LNP guys were all over it.
47. Totally agree 💯👌 this is the way. Maybe if enough of us provide this feedback. They might do it again from now on
48. So your whole family all routinely hand out how to vote cards, despite knowing how pointless and annoying it is?..... why?
49. No - they tell you the way to order the votes for your candidate preferenced 1 to get in. Always use the how to vote cards.
50. I have a policy of rejecting ANY political campaigning at the polls - including from the party I vote for. I don't approve of this kind of behaviour, I think the polls should be left alone, and political campaigns should be banned for a rather large radius away from the polls. I should be able to go to vote without encountering any in-person campaigns.
51. Yeah, I tried to be polite about it, but I didn't take any of them this time. It's just a waste of paper for me - I already know how I'm voting.
52. Went to pre poll this week, waste was consistently the reason given. A few folks had htv on their phone
53. Same, I voted at Keperra & 3 of the candidates (Furner, Savanh & the Greenie) were all having a yap & the party types with them were really chill.
54. Yeah, I wasn't at the polls for long today (I came down with Covid eleven days ago and I'm still very faintly testing positive, so I masked up and tried to get in and out as quickly as possible), but everyone seemed to be getting along at my polling booth. They were all sitting in the shade together.
55. Has been the same for us as well. Greens have been aggressive and the ECQ has had numerous complaints from voters about being harassed.
56. That's piss poor behaviour from a party that pitches themselves as taking the high road compared to the two majors.
57. All my experiences of handing out how to vote cards have been the Labor and greens people getting along and bonding over how fucked the conservatives are. It's kind of nice and I really hope there's no bullshit drama on the weekend. If anyone pulls this shit though I'm out. A commitment to democratic norms is supposed to unite us despite differences in political beliefs.
58. This has never been my experience. I hand out HTV cards and this is my third election doing it. I’ve always had pleasant experiences with the greens Volunteers. The Last Federal election was a good one, ALP, Greens, Palmer and One nation mob all were very friendly to one another with the LNP mob being very uppity, we even covered the footpath with our gazebos during the rain to get voters out of the rain and held umbrellas. But I’m out in a safe LNP electorate, so I guess maybe it’s a difference when it’s not being on the side of the safe incumbent.
59. Had a similar experience at local election earlier this. I voted at a church on Vulture Street in East Brisbane. There were greens supporters everywhere. They were very confrontational. They threw one of their how to vote cards in front of me which I said no thank you to. To which he replied I’m a fascist. I eventually told to little fucker to piss off. They have no respect for the democratic system nor have respect for it but only when it suits them.
60. I don't know if I'm just getting old but the Greens are really ticking me off lately. They are all unreasonable policies which is usual but they are blocking more reasonable ones which isn't helping anyone.
61. These pricks give conservationists a bad name. Their bullshit is doing so much more harm than good for environmentalism.
62. Most of it is collected and reused immediately across the day, then recycled at close. So voters please give your HTV card back to the volunteers when done
63. Yes! I just want to see a video of an example of this behaviour. In this day in age I don't understand how it hasn't been recorded if it's happening. I have never seen anything like this from any party.
64. greens are ***great*** for putting positive pressure on the majors, but thoughtless ideas like BCC spending a few ***Billion*** on buying Eagle farm racecourse will ensure they would be just as bad as the majors if they got power inb4 "um actually, greens said they said theyd start negotiations at $40m" yes but the compulsory acquisition laws (plus a unique law specific to eagle farm) effectively puts the price at *min* $2bn, which makes their claim of $40m even more ridiculously thoughtless
65. The practicality of some of their policies presents 'challenges' to say the least. Good as a pressure group.
66. >don't waste your vote!" "That's why I'm not voting for you!"
67. I ask this genuinely as find your comment interesting. As right leaning who's your 2nd choice if you are firmly against voting for Labor and you are against the LNP stance on pill testing?
68. If only there was a third party we could vote for….
69. I think QLD Labor have been doing a great job, what policies don't you agree with? Federal Labor on the other hand has been very disappointing
70. I dunno about anyone else, but that's EXACTLY what I want. Let them talk to each other, I already know who I am voting for, I don't need to have crap thrown into my face while going there.
71. How much carpet? It’s discounted, on sale per metre. I have a genuine Persian rug too. Cheap.
72. It isn't pointless. It's like 10-15% of people that don't make up their mind up until election day. Which is a percentage that wins elections.
73. Visibility and to help undecided voters or advise on various orders of preference (how to number boxes as there are 6 of them). The standing around also gives folks an opportunity to come and have a chinwag about anything they like
74. No. Never used a how to vote card in my life and I’m not going to start now. As long as the person you don’t want is below the person you do want, it doesn’t matter what order they’re in.
75. We should have a NZ style campaign blackout, plus no campaigning within 250 meters of prepoll
76. The stuff they hand out doesn't even make half decent toilet paper...
77. Leftish behaviour has always had the veneer of thinking they are morally superior in everything they do. There's no high road.
78. I am not inclined to believe any of this tbh. I'm yet to see a video of this behaviour and I have never once seen anything of the sort (I usually politely decline all how to vote cards). I have not had a rude interaction with anybody be that LNP, Labor, greens.
79. 💯👌 they all seem like judgmental nutbags, and many of them look like they smell
80. Please don't hand them back. It's a pain in the arse receiving crumpled and sometimes dirty how to vote cards. Us volunteers can't re-use them if they look like that. I know you mean well, but please just put them in the recycling bin.
81. It’s a hard one for me, and I’m still not decided yet.
82. I agree. I am not liking either big party. It is a vote for the least shittiest party.
83. Someone posting on Reddit about politics is obviously pretty engaged but there is a massive % of the population who aren't engaged in the least, probably couldn't name the Premier or opposition leader even, and don't decide until they get there on polling day. That's why how to vote cards are important for the parties.
84. I did volunteering for the greens on the council election and was literally told this. They put us in pairs so we could talk.
85. It is pointless, how to vote cards have no actual useful information on them, other than how they want you to vote lol
86. But its not heritage if you're "teaching someone how to vote, but teaching them how to vote for you lol
87. >it doesn’t matter what order they’re in. I mean it definitely can matter, especially in a marginal seat, and if you want your first preference to go to a minor party / independent. I'm right there with you on never looking at HTV cards personally, but I can see why they might be useful to people who aren't as engaged, and simply want to support their preferred major party.
