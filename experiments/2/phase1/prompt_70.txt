Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. Same happened in Victoria in 2019, Dan adopted some of the Greens' bigger policies and Victorians gobbled it up
2. @[mrinsane19](https://www.reddit.com/user/mrinsane19/) Great insight, that was specifically my voting ideology as I put labor 1 and greens 2 for the first time in years.
3. I’m only a newer voter (newer Aussie citizen), but this is the case for me. I’m in a safe Labor area, but I still voted Labor over Greens this election due to how close the election was meant to be. I do also think Greens have lost their way a bit on some of the issues they’re discussing, and they just don’t resonate as strongly with me. I think Miles has introduced a lot of policies that are Greens adjacent too.
4. I'm curious on this take? Not a dig, genuinely curious.
5. A few years back I observed a little old lady trying to park in the disabled car parking bays right next to the polling booth. This was where all the party volunteers were standing. They all tried to compete to be the nicest/most-helpful people there. Poor lady got flustered because she had 6-8 people all trying to help her park, but giving inconsistent directions.
6. I never fail to abuse the fuck out of the LNP party volunteers because that party is full of awful people
7. The Greens who I know who are avid environmentalists look like doctors and other professionals, because that's what they are
8. Ohhh okay that makes sense. Thank you. Hoping your voting location has a democracy sausage!
9. Parties don't control preferences unless you're following their how to vote cards. The individual voter controls their own preferences, I don't know how this is still a topic of conversation.
10. Just saw a guy fall to his knees at Woolies
11. Okay, was wondering if there was a contact before that to skip that process but couldn’t find one and hadn’t done it before.
12. It took me ten minutes to get out of bed and to my ensuite, I’m not getting to a polling station.
13. Sorry I just saw your post - she is ahead on the primary vote and one nation is coming third
14. Parliament needs someone from that age demographic especially the LNP and especially since it is likely there will be no greens in Parliament
15. Tbf, wouldn't matter for years, though it'd be bonkers as it'd split the party into all out factional warfare usually kept for first term oppositions
16. No we are talking about an LNP person saying that
17. It’s not easy but it needs fixing and if the government keeps pouring money into the Olympics and not the regions, you’ll see this voting trend continue
18. Because they're the biggest cunts before a win. Entitlement childhoods breed a level of smarm that few can endure without want to paint a cheek red from the schnoz, but sadly because daddy's a lawyer you have to resist
19. > What's broken? Minorities weren't getting hurt enough under Labor. They were getting too comfortable having rights and shit.
20. There are posts but they get downvoted to oblivion to prevent any sort of useful discourse
21. Are you sure your ALP bureaucratic job is safe? You sound worried
22. If you hate socialism, throw away your Medicare card, never use public transport, and give up your energy rebate.
23. Their entire political philosophy is based around just trying to make people mad. They simply vote the way they do because they know someone will suffer under conservative policies and those people deserve it.
24. > labour Maybe one of these days you'll be able to spell the party's name correctly. Not helping the stereotype of conservatives being poorly educated.
25. Considering what a troll this fucker seems to be, that's very accurate.
26. Also, take notice of what the representatives from the other sides do as well. Don't rely of empty promises, slogans and catch phrases dictate how you vote. These people are all about to show you who they are. Pay attention.
27. Has voting them in actually done anything positive for said regional seats though?
28. Money for votes in the last 3 months, nothing before that, you are completely right. Enjoy your new premier while swimming in magma with Miles
29. Keep living in poverty while the money is invested inner city, brainless
30. Stealing tissues is not an adult crime and thus does not qualify for adult time.
31. It's so fkn dumb. I try to imagine anyone who says that has never voted before in their life.
32. Seriously calm the f*ck down and stop over reacting. Please I would love to see where woman and LGBTQIA’s will be second class. Please show me
33. Not in state elections I don't think. Rules changed a few years ago federally and I think that's what they allowed, but you should still number every box.
34. Yes - he has done his dash as an MP
35. To be fair 7 billion over the forward estimates is barely a percent
36. Possibly, but I think people overestimate the LNP gain from postal votes. I definitely could be wrong.
37. David Criscufulli has far worse charisma than Miles. Yet he’s won, on policy or lack thereof. The “time for change” swing voters have turned.
38. It’s his or her opinion, they could say the same thing about you. Don’t hate people for a different view to yours.
39. Perfect choice for common sense, you can use keywords just bc you don’t like it, pretty stupid thing to do. What policies point to that, entertain me
40. Climate change denial, racism, pro life. What's not to like? /s
41. Cut down on youth crime, stance on abortion, stance on immigration, alp has been in power 24 of the past 26 years, still blaming lnp for problems they’ve had years to fix, plus they’re too in bed with unions, leaving tax payer money wasted because no building projects are getting done and wastes
42. The ABC is projecting 11 seats to the LNP already with ALP only 3. Not looking good so far
43. They’re not great, but it would a nice to mix it up from “I put a a bet on Labour at $8!”
44. Cant spell much right, i mean bye isnt exactly difficult
45. >Please make one with lots of prolapse creampie felching & cumin mouth & swallowing please & thankyou I thought it was the Labor/Greens supporters who were supposed to be the degenerates?
46. Results are based on electorates. So if say 1,000 people vote lnp vs 100,000 voting labor
47. Yeah but didn't you hear, vibes > stats and facts in LNP land
48. Can chalk that up as a win then, would’ve thought losing both seats may have something to do with it
49. Don’t expect the lefties on here to. I’ll pop back on here tonight and see how you are all doing when the LNP win
50. Don't forget throwing out the 50c public transport fares after the first term and also rolling back protections for trans and gender diverse people.
51. Have they? The questions I have seen have not been difficult at all and avoiding him for a lot of it
52. That was an Insiders attempted take down of Stoker there
53. I contribute more to the world than you ever would loser
54. I had to google informal vote, it’s interesting and a bit crazy, the vote should still count. If you put a 1 in the legal weed party box and nothing else, should still be a vote for them.
55. I was being a bit facetious as you would have to own a significant interest to see much benefit. (Though I could imagine a lot of people would see that money going to the government as no benefit to them individually.) But I'm sure a lot of people still see coal as a viable investment option over the medium term.
56. Your efforts are much appreciated! My husband volunteered in the P&C for years and stood behind the bbq at all the elections in that time. I know what a difference this makes to the school and the students!
57. How amazing is it. I postal voted but needed to wait for a prescription so used their website to find the closest democracy sausage to kill some time whilst I waited. Haha.
58. Yeah Townsville to be fair, despite all the arguments about figures, actually does have a youth crime problem. That part of the campaign will for sure resonate strongly there.
59. Your second point astounds me the most, this QLD Labor was probably the most progressive Labor government we’ve had at state or federal level in a very long time and the Greens were STILL saying it’s not good enough and still being very difficult to work with. Hopefully this election was a lesson in compromise.
60. Mate no one cares about Gaza. I’m sorry to say it but they don’t. It’s a waste of time telling people they’re racist if they don’t care when we have people living in tents in the middle of the city. It’s totally off putting.
61. Same in my area, and I voted in what’s supposed to be the biggest booth in our electorate. Must be lots of postal votes too.
62. Wouldn’t be surprised! I voted early during the week in the city and it was pumping with people! (Thankfully still a fast process)
63. I kind of like the bustle of election day, but I’m a raging extrovert.
64. They absolutely will. They're in the pockets of the coal industry and have already committed to axing the hydro
65. Spending money on public services is kind of the point of a government. Is everything that involves an outlay of money buying votes?
66. You mean the road that was flood damaged so got federal grants? Edit: I stand corrected. I was of the understanding it was federally supported
67. It might be rude but considering the predictions, I think there could be some truth in it.
68. Wah Wah Wah downvote me all you want I’m a Queenslander and it was a joke.
69. Pretty certain it's from the electoral roll. Not a fan of LNP either but I've received sms from all the major parties.
70. Not I got that, but is he recording all these different first name versions to voicemail to people? He’s not seriously uniquely doing this for thousands of people right?
71. I also think they'll be targeting electorates that they think they can swing
72. Up until very recently I did, and since all of my family still lives across regional and rural parts of the state I'm there pretty often, why?
73. I've been known to collect all the flyers I can from people I don't want to vote for, then stuff them straight in the bin. Figure it's one less they can hand out later in the day. Sometimes it's worth a second ask, too.
74. Pretty much every male candidate of the LNP reminds me of a dodgy real estate agent or car salesman. Sometimes worse.
75. You can make your choice on any basis you like 😀
76. I'm glad that this is the first time you're voting ALP, the state will be better off in my opinion
77. Thank you. I hope there are many more like you.
78. running a surplus at the expense of infrastructure, communications, state owned companies, selling off land instead of renting it, and then selling mined materials overseas without creating refining industries...
79. It wasn't the LNP but KAP who said they will call a conscious vote. The LNP clearly said they had zero desire to change the laws School lunches fixes a niche problem, a significant one for those affected but not a huge selling point to base a government around
80. I voted greens because it really doesn't matter who is in power for me while living in the inner city bubble
81. >He certainly seems to be more likeable in his role as premier as opposed to deputy. This, when I first heard that Miles was going to become the party leader I thought they were absolute morons. Now I think they were absolute morons for not doing it sooner.
82. What are you going on about? No one asked you.
83. Every politician is PR managed. I would say he is a bit awkward because he just wants to talk normally. Unlike others that talk so 'smoothly' you can tell they are professional liars.
84. We all know him from before he was going for premier.
85. Did you look at that Caleb Wells? what a fucking crack job... I was forced to put LAB>GRN>LCP>LNP and then all the crazies... Felt dirty putting LNP 4th...
86. I put FF and PHON above the LNP. None of those jackasses are going to be invited to address a convention of property managers who would hang on their every word and nod along and come up to them afterwards to gush about how grateful they are to be unshackled from Labor’s oppressive policies restricting their actions. The LNP totally would.
87. Funny… I hate what LNP are threatening to do so much, that I put them last AFTER Kap and ON. Fuck the LNP.
88. Yep, that’s my take on it. Pretty rare to have a politician like that. I have my fingers crossed for him, but I think it’ll take a miracle.
89. It would be really great if you could build a feature where schools and other groups could advertise for volunteers for upcoming stalls - like a "looking for volunteers' flag.
90. Do you have a front yard and bbq? Get down to Coles a you could clean up
91. Yes that is the gist of what she was saying. She also had a weird point about ABS statistics being better than the QPS statistics (which is what Labor were using). She basically said to the effect of "who cares what the statistics say, what matters is that you will see the watch houses overflowing every night, you will hear the police and prosecutors and defence solicitors all say that crime is increasing - and that's what influences the voting in Townsville."
92. I see where you're coming from now, thanks for explaining your position. Though I don't feel sick, I am biting my nails. I guess that's part of the privilege of being a man who's rights aren't at risk. I hope we get a good result in the end
93. Yes, that's the worry. So much damage could be done. And time and money to reverse.
94. We had six to choose from and I wanted to put 4 of them dead last.
95. Im Sandgate too, voted early out of electorate so I had to guess how to order the independents. Looks like I got it wro
96. Why speak when it hasn’t been called yet? Nonsense behaviour
97. mt isa can be the capital, or longreach or some shit
98. Guess the Unions going to be going strike every 2nd week now hey.
99.

100. Let the red/blue/brown map decide :) Personally, north of Chermisde :D
101. I hard agree, and it's something I have brought up in meetings, but considering it has been the state election season we have been focussing on our localities and helping out other seats as well I thought our policies were great as well. Increased Public school, Kindy, and TAFE funding, Free GP visits, establishing a Queensland owned Bank that can offer 1.5% below private banking mortgage rates etc.
102. I'd be surprised if the BDM reforms don't get repealed within the first couple of months. Hating trans people is something they've been very clear about in the leadup to the election, in contrast to basically every other topic.
103. Nah you're right, us regional Queenslanders have all been keen to get to the polls so we can make the lives of others worse. If only we were as enlightened as you to see through all these lies.
104. Now that would be a sport I would watch. Swim as fast as you can... or the crocs will get ya
105. I agree, but Miles clearly believed picking the "by the numbers lower" option was better. I personally think they should have built Vic Park and reminded everyone that it will be funded by mining royalties.
106. Yep. Bite the bullet and go with something that will leave a positive legacy.
107. As I said in a previous response (or future depending), dumb people are left leaning. 90%? What do you think super invests in What do you think dividends from super investments come from. You'd manage to bankrupt a lemonade stand. Instead of attacking people with lunatic views, go outside and workout how things work. Get out of your parents house.
108. Sorry, I thought it said north, not regional. There are 7 currently.
109. we already exporting all our best produce/meat overseas..And you want more of a excuse that to happen. Sure go ahead. As long as you take all the debt.
110. Can't address something that doesn't exist Gotta love having your very real lived experiences downplayed and outrighted dismissed by ignorant people living in a bubble that have difficulty comprehending an issue can exist even if its not affecting you or your community directly. This was a state election and these states bigger then Brisbane. There are a lot of communities in Queensland that have a youth crime problem. Time will tell if LNP policy is effective or not. What we do know is what labor was doing was not working. The key take away here is that there a lot of Queenslanders who believe that youth crime IS an issue and today they have voted for the party that at least acknowledges their issues. Thats how democracy works.
111. Used to be! I think Palaszczuk changed it to 4 after her win from Newman in 2015.
112. >Fuck Joe Kelly, I would have voted for Labor if we had another candidate but that dickhead was one of 5 alp members that voted against decriminalising abortion. Source on this? I never heard about that. Just went digging to see if I could find more info and all I could get in a few mins was a speech he made to parliament where he was seemingly conflicted but ultimately in support of the changes in 2018 and an ABC article which has him listed as one of the MPs that voted for decriminalisation. [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-17/abortion-legal-in-queensland-after-historic-vote/10382538](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-17/abortion-legal-in-queensland-after-historic-vote/10382538)
113. The ALP doesn't campaign on 'We don't like you and we will make your life worse.' LNP does. PHON does. KAP does.
114. I sure don't doubt the impact. Every one of them is a volunteer is all of them are there to sway you to vote for the party they represent. Dont try to fool yourself and others into thinking they are anything more then a sales person.
115. Oh won't lie, 80% of the Libs I interacted with, and 99% of Labor were great. I've handed out for the Greens (had a mate running) and usually for trades hall or the teachers unions, and I must say that broadly speaking people (other vollies and voters) were nicer when I wasn't party affiliated. I should also say that some of the most annoying fruitloops I've encountered were "on my side" as a Greens vollie, much to the chagrin of the policy-aware side of the Greens, the absolute space cadet Greens do exist haha. Actively had to lie about not needing help packing up the site to get one bloke to leave me alone last Federal election, he was a proper astronaut
116. That's been my experience. You're there all day together, it's far better to just treat each other like humans who just disagree.
117. Exactly just because they are attempting to achieve some civilly does not mean it's something that deserves a civil conversation. By ops logic, a candidate could run on making all criminals indentured slaves and we'd still have to be nice to the people handing out the fliers. They'll do anything but examine their own behaviour for fault
118. Absolutely, I can’t agree to disagree when it comes to my right to control my own body.
119. No, people spreading hate are spreading hate. People supporting parties who spread hate are spreading hate. I disagree with plenty of things that aren't hateful.
120. The LNP tend to lack those, since they get sexually assaulted.
121. Just because you can't see that your family member or friend is a cunt, that doesn't mean you're morally okay to support their cuntiness in parliament.
122. i dunno, we all have mothers, some of us have sisters, wives, daughters. On a single issue that is abortion regardless of your personal beliefs; you vote for a fascist party who wants to dictate reproductive rights, you're cunt.
123. Removing women's autonomy over their bodies is pretty fucking evil, yeah.
124. I mean if you're campaigning for the party that's historically been a net negative on the state whenever they've got in and specifically targets minorities and women to make their lives harder because of religious dogma, then yeah, that's kinda fucking evil. That's not to say anyone else is perfect either.
125. Because it's bad for optics at this point after the insane pushback they got. Time will tell whether the hardline conservatives suddenly grew a sense of empathy and a heart or whether they're lying to get elected and then will backflip again afterwards. I know what I'd put my money on.
126. The people who relocated to the Sunshine Coast from interstate are probably wealthy and more likely to vote LNP. There are plenty of conservatives in NSW and VIC. Not everyone from Melbourne is a Fitzroy progressive.
127. Yeah, I thought of that while I was writing it, I just didn't know how to word LNP cheering over less poors
128. There’s hope that the bigger areas swing it, just waiting on the counts
129. The old cashier bloke at Dan Murphy’s recommended I try it and I probably need it for this election 🤣
130. It'd be up to the individual LNP members as to whether they want to stay on the good side of their constituents or their party. I'm not keeping my hopes up that a conscience vote would result in no change to current laws.
131. What the aussie gal is trying to say is it is clear that this Brisbane reddit is heavily left wing as well as labor and greens supporters. That is not a reflection of the greater QLD and you can see that in the voting statistics tonight.
132. That Reddit is not reflective of the broader community, it is an echo chamber
133. It's all still being filtered through your own echo chamber. Theres no way you can not be in a echo chamber. Even if you talk to everyone and tried to live a day in their shoes you are still filtering experiences and having other things influence your thoughts. It's how the mind works. Its why monks live up in the mountains away from everyone and it is only then are they able to remove influences from the state of being. But if you want a simple understanding of people that will give you the easiest way to understand people without talking to them. We all operate off fear. The left, the right. We all fear a lack of control. Even you. Even I.
134. I agree, but when lots of people believe the same thing, your default position should be that they have justifiable reasons for doing so. Just like you have reasons why you have arrived at your belief. It's easy to write off you all of opponents as stupid but it's a simplistic way of viewing the world.
135. The polling station i went to was very quiet around 9am lol
136. Somehow KAP/PHON + LNP coalition will be more socially regressive and fucked for women and minorities than if LNP just had majority.
137. > Probably the most progressive Labor government/campaign Australia has seen since Rudd. Gillard and Shorten were both far more progressive than Rudd by most measures. Most Rudd policies were just better marketed versions of policies already being developed by the departments (eg. most components of the "education revolution" were in the works in 05/06 under Nelson's ministership).
138. Yeah I think there’d be immense pressure for them to do it at the time if they vote on it, but I also think it would be a massive long term trade off for them. Would be their equivalent to Newman sacking the public service.
139. Yeah I think the Feds are in real trouble, even with Dutton on the other side.
140. I think it's especially pronounced in Australia because we had it so good for so long, ie: basically skipped the GFC. People are not used to hard times or an economic cycle.
141. Can't hurt to give them a go..... Can't do any worse.
142. Why? If you like cars, you should still like PT. Less traffic = easier parking, faster commutes. PT is not the enemy of cars.
143. I don't think so either. He just asks shit questions. Dude's only got hypotheticals.
144. I'm saying the opposite, they should have just said "Yes, we will criminalise abortion", I honestly believe that would have been better for their image.
