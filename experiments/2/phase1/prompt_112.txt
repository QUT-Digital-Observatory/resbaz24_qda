Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Mate I don't need studies. Living in Mount Isa you can step outside your front door and watch it happen in real time. My house was broken into by three teenagers three times in as many months. These teens were known by police by face. 3 times the police put these teenagers in front of the magistrates. 3 times they walked free. And that was just my place. They robbed alot more homes then mine. Get of the internet and go speak to the people living in Mount Isa, Townsville, Cairns ect. Youth crime is massive, and part of the problem is these kids know that they are untouchable. They steal cars for fun because they know there are no consequences for it. There is no reality where letting kids commit crimes with impunity is a reasonable way to run society.
2. Every state in the country has huge issues with children and crime and them getting a slap on the wrist. Alice Springs is also great example of kids not being punished and being emboldened.
3. In every town in rural Queensland that has seen an increase in youth crime since laws came into affect making youth criminals untouchable.
4. You knew lots of people that did home invasions and grand theft auto on the regular did you?
5. What makes you think they have any interest in being a part of society?
6. And if they reoffend they can be locked up again. Pretty simple really,
7. ‚ÄúThat's a problem for future Homer. Man, I don't envy that guy!‚Äù
8. Over $760,000 per year per child in detention, or in Crisafulli terms, 9.5 full time public servant jobs lost to pay for each.
9. Well i would assume after little timmy was locked away in adult prison for 10 years after he took a joy ride at 11. him and his new "white pride" tattoo will meet up with the gang members who befriended him in prison, taught him how to be be a better criminal, will now recruit him into their criminal group where he will continue to commit crimes as he didnt learn how to be a normal human throughout his developmental years and now none will hire him for any job that pays above minimum wage as the only skills he has come from "prison U" (goooooo jailbirds!). and selling dops to kids on the side pays more than any job he could get. there is a reason we are softer on kids.
10. That‚Äôs not as good as some parts of the world, but doesn‚Äôt change the fact that if you commit one of those crimes, the community expects you to go to prison.
11. At enormous cost, both financial and in terms of making the problem worse. Do they deserve it? Depends if they‚Äôve had the genuine opportunity to learn a better way.
12. Feeling morally superior about yourself won't get you a functional society. Your self righteousness will make your descendents slaves. üòâ
13. The data is around serious indictable offenses and violent crime. No one is much bothered by petty crime
14. So your fine with your kids roaming the streets all night stealing cars and breaking into homes. Good to know.
15. So your solution is... we should make them worse? How the fuck is that supposed to help anyone lmao
16. Plot twist, he's actually selling gummy berries on the dark web.
17. I should specify: too much trauma in comparison to what he‚Äôd already been through. He was lucky not to have been caught too many times doing illegal stuff. I‚Äôm sure if he had been put back in or had spent more time in there he‚Äôd be much worse off
18. What point are you trying to make? Whether he got adult time or not, the victim suffers all the same. To entertain your scenario, let‚Äôs assume it was the catalyst into homelessness for this victim. If he got adult time, two people suffer. Two people‚Äôs lives are ruined. If he got a minor punishment and received genuine help and rehabilitation afterwards (which he did), he can now go on to live a pro-social life and help others through contributing to society. It is extremely unfortunate for the victim but punishing someone harshly by forcing them into a torture chamber that we call prison is not going to solve that issue. We should have better financial aid for those in hardship such as the victim and better social services for people like my friend; because believe me he‚Äôs one of the lucky ones. Many others in juvie don‚Äôt get the opportunity of rehabilitation, they are continually punished with no help which further perpetuates a cycle of crime. Most if not all multi-offender/violent criminals come from unimaginable trauma- usually severe sexual, physical or psychological abuse in combination with a lack of stable places to live or basic necessities being met. Further traumatising someone and labelling them a criminal will only reinforce their view that the world is not deserving of pro-social behaviour and there‚Äôs no benefit to it. Seeing crime as a symptom of something more (poverty, untreated disability and trauma) and treating the root cause will be immeasurably more beneficial to all of us as a society than prisons.

19. I commented elsewhere that I grew out of it after maybe the first 2-3 times
20. When I was a teenager in the 90s I knew kids from school who used to sneak out at night and do crimes. The parent's didn't even know, they were fast asleep. I'm not really sure what you can do about that. I think if train more teachers, pay them better to attract more skilled people, just generally get better funding to schools it will help a lot, and address poverty better. Kids need good role models not some strung out teacher with a class of 40+ kids or something due to funding cuts. We don't give these issues a fraction of the attention they deserve in Australia even though they are realistically the best things we probably can do to help the situation. I think those kids are bored, neglected, acting out. Something notable about my string of robberies is they'd quite often take a lot of food. Sad really. Its hard to stay angry at these kids when it really is all of us who have failed them, as a community.

22. I thought the same, but it's just their usual rort
23. How do you know we don't care? Even Steven miles called on Albanese to cut back drastically the number of immigrants. Do you think Crisafulli has some kind of power to stop people coming to Queensland? ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
24. What job of yours did a foreigner take? Perhaps if someone who speaks very little english steals your job, maybe you weren't very good at it to begin with..
25. The old bloke driving home after sinking 10 pints at the bowlo is also a bit of bad luck away from killing your mother, I don't see drink drivers getting 10 years. Or 10 days.
26. My point exactly.. Stop the courts letting these criminals off No justice
27. That‚Äôs what OP doesn‚Äôt say. What did they do for the 16 year sentence? Sounds like murder. I don‚Äôt care if a murderers life turns out bad.
28. You have to understand that for Labor voters, the murder of a mother in front of her family by a teenager previously charged 84 times is the preferred option compared having that teenager locked up. Her right not to be murdered was deemed less than the rights of the teenager who murdered her. Labor voters don‚Äôt believe that these young people should be held accountable for their actions, and any attempt to do so will only result in them becoming ‚Äòhardened criminals‚Äô, as if they aren‚Äôt already.
29. I‚Äôm sure they did buddy, you‚Äôre just special and they targeted you for no reason
30. i encourage you to look into COUNTLESS similar stories for adult offenders also. it is not unique to youth crime. but address all crime is a much much harder issue that wouldn't of been as easy to convince troglodytes to vote for them for.
31. I've been robbed 12 times since about 2005, and as far as I know nobody ever saw any consequences, at least from the law. I've never understood why some victims of crime respond to it with an eye for an eye though; with strategies we know only manufacture broken human beings with even more trauma. I guess I confess I maybe had that kneejerk response too the first few times. But this does not make for the kind of harmonious society many people probably imagine. It makes it much worse. Crime occurs over generations. You cannot inflict a harsh punishment on someone and expect them not to be traumatised. Their partners, children, friends, wider community all bear a burden. This is one of the greatest sources of dysfunction in our communities and where so much of our crime comes from. I don't want to be a victim of a 13th burglary. But for me this has been 20 years of this. If the guy who robbed me in 2005 was caught and had a harsher sentence back then, he'd easily still be out of jail now, with MUCH more trauma from the harsher punishment. And mostly spent time around other criminals for longer. I am not sure how this helps me now, if the people coming out of prison are just that much more broken. Seems to me like a pretty obvious recipe for long term crime increases, not decreases. This has been discussed in the rehabilitative justice sector with increased intensity ever since Clinton's Crime's bill in the 90s and generally we know that prisons themselves drive a lot of crime due to manufacturing traumatised people with greatly reduced opportunities in life. Harsher sentences is an absolutely counterproductive thing to be doing in a big big way.
32. Bro, in 1989/1990 Mt Isa and central north Queensland had the highest rates of violent and non violent youth crime in the state..I will link you to a 1992 report about the misreporting of youth crime and how there is a perception in the community that youth commit more crimes than they do. And how punitive sentencing in Qld and more police contact had less effect than diversionary efforts in other states... Here is the paper https://www.ccc.qld.gov.au/sites/default/files/Docs/Publications/CJC/Youth-crime-and-justice-in-qld-Report-1992.pdf
33. >Mate I don't need studies. And this is why we struggle with the LNP being able to campaign on fantasies
34. >3 times These are rookie numbers... I once had my car stolen and my house broken into in the same weekend. Totally seperate and unrelated. I just had shit luck and lived in pretty cheap areas of town. I was the victim of 12 burglaries in just 9 years starting 2005ish I also witnessed a robbery once maybe a decade ago where a van rolled up with an adult driving, and maybe 6 or 7 kids ran out, probably all aged under 10. One of them smashed the front door (glass) and then they were gone and into the van within maybe 1 minute, took a bunch of electronics Every time I've been the victim of some incident it was always young kids, oldest maybe 14 or so. Maybe its just me, but I don't know how to be angry at kids. Thing about this is I just feel sad about those kids and hope they can get the help they deserve. I fail to see how traumatising a bunch of kids by throwing them in jail or inflicting harsh punishment is meant to improve ... anything if I'm honest. Flooding our community with traumatised kids sounds like a bloody terrible way to try reduce crime I don't really buy that the LNP thinks so either. They just saw an easy way to get elected, knowing that there's no short supply of ignorant and spiteful people who would vote for it. They don't give a rat's armpits. Its a distraction from media attention on removing the mining tax, which is going to be absolutely monstrous as well.
35. I think the problem is only being able to choose between "lock them up" or "don't lock kids up". Because while I absolutely agree it ridiculous having no consequences, jailing kids plays out exactly as OP outlined, and it's ridiculously expensive for the tax payers. We need enforced diversion programs. We need to direct funding to earlier intervention and preventative programs. The problem is it takes longer than an election cycle for the benefits to show.
36. 80% of kids who go to prison reoffend. It clearly doesn't work.
37. sure they should be punished, obviously. no one is suggesting they just be little crime loop holes, but not prison. Not ruining their life before they are old enough to know how stupid they are.
38. What laws were changed? Ive been trying to find info on this but every time i think i find anything i find pollies waffling about the laws changed by labour but never stating what laws. Only law ive been able to find is the one where they changed the law so you can be charged as a adult from 18 to 17 and then back again a few years later and i doubt thats what everyone keeps refering too
39. Oh I didn't. I also read the rest of it and felt it was poignant to ask further questions. Would you like to answer them or will the deafening silence be enough?
40. I‚Äôve seen movies and can confirm this is how jail works.
41. That's kinda the problem we have here. We're more focused on feeling like we've enacted some form of cosmic justice against the criminals rather than trying to build a society where criminals can be reintegrated. Justice is a part of any functional prison system but it needs to be based on reform otherwise they just come out angry and vengeful, no life skills, no job abilities and rejected by society, so they just go commit more crimes, and possibly worse crimes. Is it justice if some kid goes to jail for theft or assault, then comes out and joins a biker gang or starts doing armed robberies because they have no ability to integrate?
42. Doesn't change the facts within said video. If you're choosing to ignore them that's on you
43. Cool, is it broken down by certain offenses? do you have a link to the evidence/study(s)?
44. But do you deserve to be? What if you permanently injure someone for life? If you permanently ruin someone else‚Äôs life, you don‚Äôt deserve a second chance.
45. Um, my Dad is rich, can I get non custodial or time served?
46. Yes, anyone's mum is far more likely to be killed by a drunk driver or abusive partner than a random home invader. But strangely I haven't heard a peep about either issue from the LNP (or their reddit shills) this election season...
47. I don't have any sympathy for a murderer either. But when the murder is released, whether it's after 30 days or 30 years, I'd rather they were reformed and didn't do it again.
48. Yeah but you‚Äôre not thinking about the future, in which this murderer spends 30d in jail around other possibly violent criminals and then is released back into society with no supports or preventives.
49. I said that they did something horrible. That could have been murder. My question stands: what happens when they‚Äôre released in the prime of their criminal lives?
50. I don‚Äôt believe in a three strike rule necessarily being a good thing‚Ä¶ but somewhere before 84 it should have been a case of enough is enough.
51. They believe you and your family being killed is acceptable because the kids bad upbringing over rides your family‚Äôs right to safety.
52. I'm not special at all mate. What I described is a very normal situation that happens to plenty of people in those towns. Thats the point.
53. Go live in any of the poorer parts of Rockhampton or Townsville and get back to me.
54. A quote from the link above: "The younger a child was at their first sentence, the more likely they were to reoffend (with any offence), to reoffend violently, to continue offending into the adult criminal jurisdiction, and to be imprisoned in an adult prison before their 22nd birthday." Tell me, does the child commit more crimes because they were sentenced, or is it because a child that grows up in an environment that leads to crime is most likely to remain in that same environment to commit more crimes In Queensland, if a child commits an offence, the law says that the child should generally be kept out of the criminal justice system in Queensland. So if your logic is harsher punishment is bad, and the current punishment is non existent, then the solution is to let kids commit crimes with impunity? Edited: link was from a different poster.
55. The teenager who murdered a mother in north lakes had been previously charged 84 times, and was forced to participate in an ‚Äòevidence based‚Äô weekly module designed to stop his reoffending. He never spent a day in prison. Ultimately, he ended up a stabbing a mother to death in front of her husband and kids. As a Labor voter though, you‚Äôll be pleased to know he‚Äôll be out of prison in just under 10 years, ready to be your neighbour. Why do labor voters prioritise the rights of teenage criminals over the rights of innocent people not to be murdered?
56. What cost do you put on a human life? There is plenty of money to incarcerate career criminals
57. 80% of kids who commit a crime severe enough to gather a prison sentence reoffend. That does not necessarily mean the prison sentence causes them to reoffend.
58. But at least they can‚Äôt harm the public while they‚Äôre incarcerated? That‚Äôs a benefit in itself.
59. And? They‚Äôll go back when they are released. Big deal. Keep them where they belong.
60. If they‚Äôre old enough to steal a car or bash someone they‚Äôre old enough to know it‚Äôs wrong and stupid, old enough to know it has consequences.
61. How old were you when you knew it was wrong to steal, mug and murder? I don‚Äôt remember not know that. Certainly by the age of four or five.
62. To be clear, it sounds like I'm on the same side as you with my opinion on the idea behind locking kids up. There's no need to be rude.
63. I think you‚Äôll find the vast majority of people believe that if you commit a violent crime you should go to prison
64. What‚Äôs the point in ruining two people‚Äôs lives? In the end, if someone can be rehabilitated back into pro-social behaviour, why cause even more unnecessary suffering? It‚Äôs not going to change the past and it‚Äôs not going to help the future. It‚Äôs just causing more suffering
65. So Crisafulli is going to make legislation that conflicts with federal discrimination laws and not allow people to work based off there race or nationality? Yeah that's Gunna go down super well ü§£
66. I said very little..I didn't say no english.. What costs do Labor cut by using foreigners?
67. Always gonna be a case by case basis. Broad, fuck em all, approachs ain't helpful. But they make you feel good.
68. We can change the law so murderers die in jail.
69. At least they're away from the public for that time! Jesus
70. See, you can't even read. I didn't post the links. I don't know which link you clicked but from what you;'ve quoted it's saying that jailing children at a young age has a high rate of calcifying them into a life of criminality. *That means more victims*. It's bad. >So if your logic is harsher punishment is bad, and the current punishment is non existent, then the solution is to let kids commit crimes with impunity? 'Don't send kids to jail' is not 'let kids commit crimes'. If you checked the other redditors links looking to learn, instead of cherry picking a gotcha (badly) you'd see that advocates against 'adult time' are advocating for other forms of intervention such as in the USNW article. >Professor Brown says there‚Äôs a number of social policies that could better reduce re-offending. >‚ÄúSocial policies for reducing long-term unemployment, increasing adult education, providing stable accommodation, increasing average weekly earnings, and various treatment programs will bring about reductions of re-offending,‚Äù he says. No one is saying to not respond to youth crime, they're saying that deterrence based approaches *do not work.* You still apprehend criminals, you still have cops out there doing cop shit, but instead of funding policy work on harsher punishments, you fund policies that address the cuases of criminality. \\ Just like you even say (maybe inadvertently, you address the *environment* the child is in, not the child to reduce criminality. Reduce poverty, address wealth inequality, ensure accommodation is accessible for everyone and just basic human shit. Treat these kids like animals and just put them in a cage and you'll get that energy back. It's a policy to make people feel self satisfied about punishing people they hear about in the news, not a policy to actually reduce the number of victims by actively reducing crime.
71. Because this sad series of events happens more when you create more criminals through the policy platform of the LNP. The fact you think that supporting the more effective method of reducing crime is somehow being in favor of crime is a great example of the lack of object permence needed to fall for the LNPs appeal to emotions over evidence. That you tried to make me feel bad just shows how in the pocket for feelings over facts. If you really felt bad for victims you'd care about what the most effective strategy to reduce the number of criminals over how best to punish criminals *after* victims have already suffered.
72. You don't think removing a child from homes, relationships with friends and families and removing any possibility of getting a job and a real education has an impact on whether a child will reoffend upon release? The general consensus among criminologists and professionals is that it does. There are countless studies out there that prove this.
73. Not exactly a benefit if it predisposes them to a future in crime.
74. So lock them up and spend a shit ton of money, then release them and let them harm again, then lock them up and spend a shit ton of money, and repeat?
75. Sure, but not everyone had the same simple good upbringing as me.
76. >The benefit to the community of having juvenile offenders locked up for significant periods of time is that they cannot victimise people while in custody (other than fellow detainees) Let's be clear then. These are your words defending the detainment of youths. We aren't the same. I don't see any benefit to anyone when children are behind bars. You made no effort in your original comment to say that this is an LNP argument you tried to save yourself in the edit. Your silence to the questions isn't great. If you had answered them we could then see if we are on the same side. Not intending to be rude but also don't care if you've taken it that way as I find your original comment vile and following silence to the questions shameful.
77. No one's denying that but the prison system we have that is 100% punishment 0% reform is doing nothing but breeding more criminals, costing tax payers more due to paying out private prison costs, it disproportionately affects ATSI communities and keeps them jn cycles of poverty and worsens social cohesion because no one trusts anyone because crime is so rampant. Prison doesn't work as 100/0, it needs to be worked towards 50/50 reform/ punishment
