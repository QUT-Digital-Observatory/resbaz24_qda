Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. One of my besties is staunch lnp volunteer, I helped ALP, we caught up a few days ago and we agreed a mixed or more balanced Parliament is in everyone's interests. But only if sh!t gets done. Incidentally, it was very civil at my local poll, the reds and blues chatted all day, locals who knew each other and were respectful. (Not a Green in sight, perhaps they moved to West End)
2. I don‚Äôt believe Crissafulli won. Labor lost. There‚Äôs a big difference sadly
3. I don‚Äôt know the reasons, but I do know that hard core labor voters have turned, my father is a lifetime union member, his father a member of the labor party, his grandmother one of the first female QLD union members and family history in the labour movement dating back to the Ballarat goldfields, and he voted Liberal.
4. LNP going into the campaign with no solid plan worked, since it let everyone's imagination run wild with the ideas of, "'x' will finally be fixed.".
5. So, from coworkers I got: Because, with the exception of the 3 year Newman government, Labor has been in power since 1998. Thus since 1998 they have had 23 years in power to organise and improve things or ignore and break things. Obviously, they did both as any political party would do. Because some people were still hurting over decision and decision making processes made during Covid, unable to see dying relatives, etc. Some were worried about issues around how Labor dealt with the corruption watchdog. Because some people were concerned about the amount of money being spent and borrowed against the future as part of the election campaign. That's a list I heard from people at work. In the end both parties have some pretty serious shortcomings and issues, however, and I understand people's passion, Reddit has been giving very loud Labor and Miles are Jesus/Gandhi equivalents and LNP and Crisafulli are Satan/Hitler - which beyond being simplistic and silly doesn't really get others talking and makes threads an echo chamber. FYI, that's an observation, not an invitation to start an argument.
6. Friend voted ALP, but still thinks the local LNP member will be good for the town. They have an active history working in the local area, and doing a lot for the community.
7. - If you like big holes in the ground, we'll be getting more of those - If you like car parks being available in the CBD, that'll happen - If you are a developer, cha-ching!
8. I worked in the Qld government for many years, and the stuff I saw over the last 7 or 8 years was pretty bad. There are a few ministers I worked under who cared more about getting themselves on the news rather than having stuff done properly. It is a shame for Steven Mike's as I do like him, and I hope he stays as leader.
9. has anyone given a genuine answer yet? Here are some good points: \- LNP raising the first home buyers grant from 700k-800k \- LNP to establish $2bil fund to help councils build infra for developers \- Clamp down on youth crime (as many have already mentioned \- Reducing surgery wait list for public hospitals \- Increase of ambos on the road \- a regulatory review into the building industry (much needed imo) \- $27mil towards free vision, hearing, speech checks for kids \- LNP promised to have a decision on the Olympic situation within 100 days Obviously both sides have some good points. but instead of everyone saying "we're doomed" and being negative i think an actual answer to the question is needed. The election happened. the LNP won. We need to deal with it and move on.
10. ‚ÄúI think Steven Miles is a twat.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù ‚ÄúBecause the Courier-Mail said so.‚Äù
11. The LNP have committed to scrapping the current Stage 4 route which will in effect wipe out the township of Elimbah. I voted to save my town. https://preview.redd.it/kz483j9ww8xd1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a81ff61d3dc21672f3c5d82d155b95c3f6640b6c
12. Someone I know voted Bree James because they liked her Hitler joke ü§£ü•≤üòÖ this person is not my friend
13. 1. Olympics 2. Crime 3. Promised to match 50c fares - ALP‚Äôs policy but would have been a dealbreaker for me they were going to remove it. 4. Promise to fix Union corruption Edit: added 4
14. Friends - some come from big, Christian, traditional, business-owning and property-owning families. I don't think it gets any more "core voting base" than that. I think the LNP objectively benefits them, I can't blame them on that. Not to say they always vote Liberal, mind, but they generally will when the country does.
15. My local member failed our community,it was time for a change‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs as simple as that
16. Probably one of the bright spots of the LNP is in the seat of Bonney, held by Sam O'Connor on the Gold Coast. From following his personal insta hes campaigned on keeping Jacks Law, (extra police power for on the spot checks for knives in late night precincts and train stations.) and funding for wildlife hospitals, I think the amount was $5 million. He was the shadow Environment and Science minister and if he keeps his role in the cabinet will be a young fresh face for the party. Although the environment will probably be completely destroyed under his role, I am hoping that it might not be as bad as Cambell Neumann. I used to live in his electorate but have since moved to Brisbane. Hes got genuine community support and does alot for his electorate, unlike the Fools seat just above his.
17. As a nurse, I‚Äôm interested to see what‚Äôs next. There is no mention of a pay increase to nurses or how they are going to help with daily occupational violence we experience. The truth is we are underpaid, over worked, physically and mentally abused, and have no real support. They keep saying they will deliver more nurses. But all the experienced nurses have left and are still leaving the industry in record numbers. A QNMU poll asking if you were thinking of leaving came back with 18,000+ responses saying they will leave by mid 2025. Nurses are more likely to be attacked on the job than corrections and police officers. We have no hazard pay and some administration officers are getting more money than bedside nurses. Yes, the nursing diploma is free in TAFE. But the registered nursing degree is $40,000+ for content that is way out of touch with industry. Education needs to come back to the hospital, bring that money back from universities into the public and private systems. Allow for paid placements without income stipulations. The current new grad from university are barely capable of safely caring for 1 patient when our ratio is 4. One of the LNP health plans is this: To identify where the pressure-points are and target funding to fix them: We will unlock transparent real-time hospital data within 100 days. We will provide Queenslanders with the truth about what‚Äôs happening in our hospitals, as it happens, not when it‚Äôs politically convenient. We will deliver accountability for wait times, the number of patients waiting at Emergency Departments and how many hospital beds are available. We will use real-time data to drive resources and frontline staff to where they are needed Every nurse needs to utilise the workload reporting form on their desktop or print out, depending on facility. As this real time data will become more valuable than ever with the LNP looking at what‚Äôs wrong. It will show our short staffing crisis and skill mix issues.
18. I was always told growing up to vote for LNP because they help people who want to work hard and make money , not people who just want hand outs
19. Bc their fking name was familiar. "I just voted for the names I knew" That's what we're living amongst.
20. It‚Äôs really weird to ask about people‚Äôs honest opinions here on reddit because the community is anything but accepting of different view points. Anyone who voted for parties progressive people of reddit don‚Äôt like are labeled ‚Äúwaste of space‚Äù and worse (just a beautiful little post in Queensland community). It‚Äôs very similar to how aggressive anti-Trump crowd is in America. They would literally scream at your toddler because you dare vote in ways they don‚Äôt approve. So the majority of people just vote quietly against people who repeatedly insult and berate them. Pretty understand position.
21. Most people don‚Äôt not have a clue on the policies of any party. They vote on who they like or dislike. Literally as we were sitting in front of the polling booth, my wife asked me who we‚Äôre voting for. I told her who I‚Äôm voting for and why. I told her the policies the two major parties were offering and she said ‚Äúoh!‚Äù She literally did not have a clue. She would‚Äôve voted LNP because that‚Äôs what her parents have always done. If everyday Australians just took an interest in what‚Äôs being offered then I don‚Äôt think the LNP would ever get in. Incidentally, the LNP are better for my line of work but ethically speaking I cannot bring myself to vote for them.
22. I voted independent. My entrenched ALP member certainly skirts the line between crook and politician, is a union crony and is constantly in the media at all levels for his 'shenanigans', failings and dodgy deals, and is probably lucky to have not been charged with multiple white collar offences. But he got back in again. If he was an LNP member and did the same things he had done over the last few terms, this sub would be calling for his head.
23. Here is my reasoning (not that it matters‚ÄîI was in an ultra-safe Labor seat). As a teacher, I am burnt out. Our pay has been stagnant, matching only inflation for the past six years, yet we are being asked to work longer hours and take on more administrative duties. The government has removed any viable method of disciplining students, and it‚Äôs now seen as a black mark for principals to suspend students, so they don‚Äôt. Education is in crisis, and Labor has been in charge of it. None of the eight-page policy documents they‚Äôve released address teachers‚Äô concerns. The focus is solely on students and parents. The LNP‚Äôs document, on the other hand, focuses on helping teachers. Whether they can deliver on that or not remains to be seen, but I am willing to give them my vote and a chance to try. I already know Labor won‚Äôt do anything for me, except make me more burnt out. The LNP government might backfire, but for my personal circumstances it was the best vote for me.
24. Not me but my mum works with someone and they voted because of something to do with solar panels
25. People didn't vote for the LNP. They remember how the ALP state government behaved during the pandemic, and, well... A whole lot of other reasons no doubt.
26. I dont align with a political party I HATE the fact people call themselves left or right, I think that‚Äôs complete gang mentality, cult like hive mind behaviour from both sides. I didn‚Äôt vote LNP, But my guess is the majority of people who are unhappy with what the government has done over the past 3 terms the ALP has been in power and they want things to change. they probably wouldn‚Äôt care what the LNP announced on the policy level, they just want change to the government that they are sick of not addressing their wants. Maybe if Steven miles had of taken over earlier from Anastasia and was able to make some more policy change or listened to the public in time they may still be in power? But I think it boils down to people being unhappy and wanting change and clearly the majority have lost faith in the ALP. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get downvoted to hell but I don‚Äôt care, you need to stop being hysterically politically aligned, change is okay, the country will still keep running no matter which party is in power. it‚Äôs a shame we all follow this left and right bullshit and there isn‚Äôt a party that actually cares about all people across the board. Left and right are both flawed.
27. If I still lived in my hometown of Mackay I might have voted for Nigel Dalton, the LNP candidate. I know him personally and have a lot of respect for him and I know he's there to serve his community because he did even when I was a kid. Although I disagree with his party's policies, he *personally* would have probably got my vote. People can lose my vote by lacking integrity and honesty, even if they represent my preferred party; I think the opposite can be true as well.
28. A government that allowed what was described as the biggest criminal forensic lab blunder in human history does not deserve another go.
29. i've been scrolling & reading for a while, have people realised what LNP will be doing??? like holy moly
30. Honestly‚Ä¶ no one I know will own up to voting LNP‚Ä¶ someone had to. And here we fucking are.
31. The labor government Olympics plan was a hunk of shit that they backed themselves into and weren‚Äôt able to back out of it without losing face. That doesn‚Äôt mean lnp will do anything better necessarily, but there is a good chance they will, because qsac is the stupidest idea ever
32. Some bloke very proudly posted on r/Australia that he voted LNP because he was basically taking the risk on a change of government making things better, didn't know about any of the policies and admitted that he knows he's going to be worse off financially with LNP in power, the stupidity is never ending
33. I swing far left and generally vote greens, I think Miles odd a pet good and honest bloke. Many feel in my circles that 10 years is enough for a good democracy. Also Greens only caring about Palestine and marching at CFMEU rallies didn't help.
34. I never vote LNP ever but if there‚Äôs one thing that hope comes out of this is that the ex car dealerships on Anzac Ave in Petrie get something done. They‚Äôve been a fucking eyesore for the entire last Labor government which refused to progress it at all. Genuinely 10 years of arson, vandalism and just bullshit. So it‚Äôd be nice if something happened with it. I‚Äôm sick of fucking looking at it.
35. Was more 100% bulkbilled gp clinics not a good ideaü§î
36. you are all sounding like Americans right now, with the position that you can't even be friends with someone who has a slightly different political perspective to you. It's been the downfall of America with extreme polarisation and echo chamber mentallity. Get a grip
37. I remember last time they got in.. I work in a public hospital. And it was baaaaad with all the cuts of staff.
38. I just wish there was a party that sat in the middle, I like some policies on both sides, and our only choice is to pick the least shit of the two.
39. I had someone tell me that ALP was protecting paedophiles because LNP was bringing forth Daniel's law.
40. I think the answer is people think on balance, the LNP may be better for at least the next term, having regard to what the ALP has been or has not been doing. I think it's lesser of two evils this time. Conventionally, my impression is that the LNP is harsher, so they are good at dealing with problems with harsher measures but people vote the ALP back in once those problems subside and we want a more socially progressive party to equalise the rights of various groups in the community.
41. They won‚Äôt waste $2b+ pa on a misguided ‚Äúschool lunch‚Äù program
42. To all the people saying 14000 healthcare workers lost their jobs last time around, well a lot of these were useless placemats. Clinical vs admin ratio has gotten worse and worse last few years, actually being a doctor and trying to get shit done at places like Ipswich or Logan is next to impossible. LNP might screw up sure, but I‚Äôm willing to give them a chance. Also the abortion thing is pure fear mongering from labour. If libs ever touched it they‚Äôd be voted out in a huge landslide next election. I think Crisafulli actually wants a legacy other than that of a 1 term premier.
43. **Briefly**, Youth Crime. **Longer response (Trigger warning):** Perhaps this sub's main residents are from well-to-do suburbs who have never first-hand faced these issues, but from what I've seen there has been (a) lot of inter-state immigrants, (b) teenagers seem to have crime immunity. Inter-state immigrants change voting demographics. The suburbs have been very closely fought, with ALP wins being with barely 500 to 1000 votes in many places. So, yes ALP has lost more ground than meets the eye. Secondly, there have been quite a few break-ins into logan, GC and other non-core brisbane suburbs by minors. Police don't register cases, and just let the teens go, even if the home residents try to hold them with evidence (like video). Worse, they get threatened/warned for unlawful withholding (like kidnapping) or assault on the youth even if the owners were just trying to defend themselves. Some suburbs like Pallara, the people took it on themselves and patrolled their own streets at night because neither did the police did anything (cos they couldn't due to the deliquents being minors) nor was their any recourse. This did go up on the news a while ago. Yes, there is statistics that this sub loves to quote *"buh buh buh stats says youth cime is reducing! Science no lie!"*. Tell that to the neigbourhood which was affected and maybe never included in the stat due to cops just letting them go without any reports (or as "unknown persons"). There was no politician or politics involved when your neighbourhood was robbed and you learn you are legally powerless. Stats take a back seat when you see a safety issue in your own locale, even if the even was once a year. I am sure no one wants the police to put kids in Jails. Their main hope with change in government is to bring the fear of the law into a demographic (youth), who currently appear to be legally immune. Note: These are votes from people who voted labor for their mayoral/council candidates. P.S: I don't have voting rights in Australia yet, so these are just observations.
44. Dont mind ALP but they seem to be soft as fuck on crime / sentencing minimums / general law and order. Thats only reason i voted LNP
45. I don't think it's too difficult to understand why people voted LNP given the cost of living and housing crisis. It's the same thing that's been seen all over the world when people will vote for someone else no matter how good or bad that other party is.
46. 1) Reduce union influence 2) Reduce number of youth crime victims 3) Reduce ideologically possessed lefties to tears
47. You might hate the LNP but the LNP does get stuff built, in all states and federally, they may run the state into the ground financially but they get the ball rolling. Just look at NSW, the LNP planned and started building a bunch of metro lines, then Labor got into power, saw the projects were bankrupting the state and canned a few of them. The LNP got the first few built. The olympics shenanigans would be more clear under LNP than Labor, probably one of the most promising outcomes of this election. Everything else though, not so much but hey atleast the next election will be a crushing defeat for them considering the LNP track record in QLD time after time again
48. I am passionate about politics, a post graduate economist and a swing voter at the state level. Typically I swing based on specific issues as I find both parties rarely stick to their 'values'. Last election I voted ALP due to assisted dying laws. This time I voted LNP as: 1. Stamp Duty is the most inefficient tax and appears to be the easiest lever to pull to improve housing affordability. LNP are removing it for first buyers of new builds. A step in the right direction but such an awful tax should be eliminated. 2. ALP were proposing price controls on petrol, state owned petrol stations and energy retailers. This is dangerous territory, expanding the role of government significantly out of the bounds of where it should be. The policy intent is a good one but the actual outcomes of these types of policies is the opposite. This announcement made voting LNP a no-brainer for me. I still feel sick voting for a party that had the gall to have a billboard with 'Adult Crime, Adult Time". I have a hope that it is more just fear mongering/vote grabbing rather than a slogan that will convert to actual policy.
49. i cant think of any good reason. maybe they hate women
50. The amount of times I saw street interviews with people saying ‚ÄúI voted liberal because I always have‚Äù or ‚ÄúI voted liberal because my family does‚Äù was infuriating. Having grown up in a family that were purely LNP voters because ‚Äúwe just are‚Äù to the point that anything that was said by Labor was instantly deemed worthless, I had to make the active effort to unlearn these biases and do at least some basic research. Voting because everyone you know voted that way is mob mentality, a concept that has proven incredibly dangerous and counterproductive throughout all of human development (barr the fucken cave men) It‚Äôs the same with all the people I saw voting against Labor because they didn‚Äôt like Miles‚Äô face. Like come ON. We are meant to be adults, that means actually taking responsibility for your actions and decisions. I am worried about losing the cheap public transport and the cost of living relief produced from the mining royalties, but weirdly enough I don‚Äôt really have a right to worry about myself when the election effectively turned into a race to become the US. I am so sorry to everyone that the liberals and the minor parties are going to hurt, and to the women of QLD, I can only hope that Crisafulli turns out to have some integrity and stick by his word that abortion will not actually change in his term. It‚Äôs been a disappointing and infuriating result for quite a lot of us, so all I am holding on to is the possibility that Crisafulli turns out to be a much different person when not in opposition, because his track record in both politics and business seem worrying.
51. Friend of mine today said he voted LNP because he hates unions. That's it. Didn't seem to.know what he'd actually be voted for in terms of policies.
52. Voted LNP to see Reddit go into melt-down. It's as if everyone here lost a personal gaurdian. Surprisingly, only 31% of Qld residents preferenced the ALP, so Reddit really is a weird little ALP enclave.
53. Time for a change if nothing else. The Reddit community ‚Äòbubble‚Äô is obviously overwhelmingly pro Labour, you need to leave the ‚Äòbubble,‚Äô in particular go out to the regions to see some of the issues people are facing outside the SE Qld ‚Äòbubble,‚Äô to get an understanding. Not everyone‚Äôs priority is abortion, and some of the other issues I‚Äôve seen people raging about on this forum, which I suspect reflects the Reddit demographic. You won‚Äôt get much understanding here in the Reddit echo chamber.
54. Brother thought labour was being pretty useless but he wasn't happy when I told him what the party he voted for was actually saying. He just wanted change but didn't actually look.
55. I‚Äôm sorry to be the student here guys but would any one be kind enough to give me a quick run down of what tf is going on in Australian politics lol Appreciate any ones help! (I‚Äôm from the uk)
56. "Sometimes you just need to change things up, even if it's not ideal"
57. My friend voted because he saw youth crime. Happen once, and thinks it‚Äôs on the rise and he is aging.
58. As if there's any difference. Both are inept, out of touch and most likely corrupt
59. I have my fingers crossed we get a kick ass new stadium for the Lions and Olympics. I hope it guarantees test cricket in Brisbane for at least half a century. That would be a decent legacy in itself imo.
60. Can anyone point to the major policies where these two bunch of numptys are any different ??? Like seriously what policy , did you feel truely was different and said I'd vote for you. Same same but different.
61. "Miles gave me the ick, I'd never date him" ü•≤
62. ALP signed up for the Commonwealth games and olympic games. Huge loss leaders. That's why. Billions of dollars lost at each of them when hosted. And everyone's worried about the economy because of LNP....
63. literally the only difference between Labor and liberals is 3 years
64. I think many older persons and those with families are very concerned about youth crime. Crime has also impacted many and people are sick of seeing news stories on it so a change was needed. I don‚Äôt think free lunches got people over the line at all. How many households would that even apply to in the scheme of things.
