Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. IDGAF who you vote for. IF, you're voting because you genuinely believe that person will do right by ALL Australians. The people I have zero respect for. Are the "team voters" The LNP is my team, the ALP are the enemy. Anyone who disagrees is the enemy. FMD grow up, nobody cares you were picked last for sports day. Idiots like that need to learn. Politics isn't a team sport. These political parties aren't your team. They're public servants, nothing more. The Federal LNP had 9, god damn years, to make Australia energy efficient. We were left with an energy crisis and 20+ failed energy policies. We were left with a housing crisis, a rental crisis. Hospital shortages, trade shortages and sooooo on. Weird how Federal Labor haven't built 9 years worth of housing, in 2.5 years. Or fixed our electricity grid, or hospitals, or job training. 9 god damn years. This QLD LNP mob. Will screw QLD'ers over for the sake of big business. And will leave Qld'ers worse off.
2. Agree. If nuclear had any possibility of being viable in any way, energy companies would be supporting the idea and pushing for contracts. Their long loud silence tells us everything we should need to know.
3. Like the issue was nuclear was viable when it was super unpopular due to the combo of Chernobyl and Fukushima, and it’s only now that that unpopularity is starting to fade, as it did make sense economically then. In countries that already have nuclear you can at least use experienced workers and thus make an argument for it, but here? It’s not like Dutton is saying construction starts the day he gets in which I would at least respect because then he’d be doing something, he’s saying we’ll think about it more in 4 years time. Then he’ll say i again and again and again. That’s what annoys me most.
4. Those fuckwits in the LNP for sure have fumbled this election in a big way, but I also gotta give props to Labor and my man Miles for clawing their way out of a seemingly unwinnable position. Reason and sanity may yet win out.
5. This is behind a paywall, but here is the key information: - Steven Miles is now Queensland’s preferred premier leading Crisafulli 45-42, huge reversal of Crisafulli’s 46-39 lead in September - TPP: 52.5-47.5 to LNP, would deliver a narrow 2 seat majority for Crisafulli LNP - Newspoll had LNP leading 55-45 in September
6. No matter what happens on Saturday the LNP are well and truly fucked. Just a few months ago polls were saying they would decimate Labor and now they’re staring down the possibility of a slim majority. They were handed a crushing victory on a silver platter and they’ve still fucked it. If Labor come out in second place (which is still very likely) they’ll have 4 years to hammer the LNP on every single thing they fuck up. At the very best, they’re destined to be a 1 term government and Crisafulli will be out of a job in 2028.
7. While I'm still here deluding myself that Labor might still win so I don't fall into a deep depression, I just have to say. Don't you just love to see the LNP shoot themselves in the foot? And the best thing is, they just keep doing it. And it never gets any less funny.
8. This was ALWAYS happening. You had an LNP who were running on the deep and complex platform of "We're not the ALP"... So the ALP running a 'We're actually competent" platform left the LNP with a massive issue.
9. LNP are McFucked if this goes the polls way. Very real chances of minority Govt for Labor, and possibly really bad fall out for the LNP should they lose. 4 years of reflection, 15000 ABC docos on how they did it wrong lol. Who knows, maybe fuckwittery will win though.
10. Every fibre of my being is telling me to not have hope that Labor scrapes a win with Milesy being awesome lately and Cristafullofshit & Co fumbling, but I can't help but hold my breath a little. It'd be a shit 4+ years with LNP, even with only a 2 seat majority.
11. The lnp is going to win. But i expect the alp to win the next election simply because the lnp can't help themselves and will end up selling out the entire state, they'll fire people and everyone will know someone that was affected by their bs.
12. It will depend on if it’s too late. Perhaps 40% of the vote is already cast.
13. i still fully expect LNP to win this year, but i think they will get utterly massacred in 2028 because i fully expect them to follow through on the Abortion restrictions
14. I think the LNP will still win, but they need a much better buffer than a few seats, when you get a lot of new parliamentarians in you often lose a few as they do stupid things, or forget to declare things they should have.
15. What a complete imbecile Christafulli or whatever his name is, all he had to say was "we promise not to roll back the abortion laws", even if he didn't personally agree with it, sometimes you need to make compromises in order to not get wedged, both parties do it, and so long as they stick by their word there's nothing wrong in it, it's just pragmatism. But he was so so sure of himself that he flew too close to the sun.
16. i was going to put 50k on ALP winning but they're too far behind in the polls :| YouGov is pretty accurate for predicting elections about a week before they happen. if they ALP was in a slight lead i'd put money on it. the sentiment in mainstream social media (e.g. facebook, twitter, instagram, reddit) is generally favorable to ALP but it's those offline boomers that scare me. i fear the senile grandma who has heart palpitations whenever someone with broccoli hair passes by her at woolworths. if u want to make money, put money on metropolitan electorates. alp is going to smash the majority of it. it's everywhere else im not sureabout.
17. My local LNP candidate and his team can’t even write coherent sentences in their public media. My local candidate wants to close the deposit gap for 1000 Queenslands! A huge multidimensional undertaking IMO.
18. absolute wishful thinking here bordering on delusion. This election is going one way. If you actually think Labor has a chance (which they dont) sportsbet is currently paying $8 for a Labor win. Honestly the most skewed odds I have ever seen in an election.
19. Fumbling is the LNP. Fumbling with kiddies, fumbling your tax returns, fumbling your allowance claims.
20. Question: given that you’d gives me hope that we may not end up with LNP, but I usually support Greens, am I better off voting 1 for Labor this time? Does that give them more than voting for Greens and then having preferentially voting going to Labor?
21. Amazing how easy it was for the façade to come down. *Axe the tax* *Stop the boats* *Faster Cheaper Sooner* *Time For Change...*
22. I said it 2 weeks ago and will say so again now - Chrisafuckli is Queensland's very own Bill Shorten. He might still win, but holy moly with a bunch of morons... all they had to do was keep their mouths shut.
23. Really weasly lookin fella, I wouldn't trust him with my lunch money
24. Sportsbet still paying $8 for labour seems either a steal or its still certain
25. This whole campaign has been a generational fuckup on Crissafulli's part regardless of the result - not only the abortion thing but also the push on youth crime as if any voter actually cares about that.
26. The poll was a lie, only their viewers vote and only media illiterate people still watch them
27. Crying shame. The ALP are just crap. We need them gone & if this absolute nonsense which is just all spin & rubbish change the election result. It's just such a shame.
28. i want to lnp to fumble my cock and balls just like their priests fumbled theirs 40 years ago.
29. Robbie Katter seemed to put his abortion idea forward with the assumption that they'd win as a given. Delightful to see the LNP have gone and done the same. Get out and vote, people of Queensland!
30. Lol. I trust Miles about as much as I trust a Catholic priest from the 70's. I'm going to enjoy having a drink this evening to every labor politican out of a job. 🍸🍸🍸
31. I guess the hope for Labor is the regional/urban differences. There’s a world where there’s biggish swings in LNP strongholds and regional areas yet Labor just holds on in a bunch of marginal seats in greater Brisbane. Kevin Bonham who is a very respected election academic (think Antony Green) said on twitter his model has it being only slightly more likely that it’s an LNP majority than it is a hung parliament based on the numbers. Things could get interesting
32. Man, a 2 seat majority would technically be a victory for the LNP, but given how up until recently they were heading for a landslide victory, that'd have to feel pretty disappointing. Meanwhile Labor would probably be elated if the LNP only ended up with a 2 seat majority. Crisafulli has had one of the worst campaigns I've seen in years. It's like he's pulling a Campbell Newman and squandering his massive lead, but doing so *before* he even gets a term in government.
33. > They were handed a crushing victory on a silver platter and they’ve still fucked it. The fun part is, all they had to do was sit there and pretend to be normal until election day. But they couldn't control themselves. The less fun part is, if they couldn't control themselves when things were smooth sailing, what are they going to be like when in power but with poor opinion polling?
34. That’s kind of the problem though. The LNP will have time to booby trap the Olympics budgets just in time for Steven to get back in 2028…. The LNP can still do a shitload of damage.
35. I mean, in a way, this result might be for the best. Wafer thin majority LNP government will have to watch its back, and (hopefully) not do anything too drastic. Labor get back in next time because they've shaken off the "it's time" factor.
36. Reading this makes me happy like a child on Christmas morning 😁
37. Yeah, if anything it will be a pyrrhic victory for the LNP. To fall from grace so hard so quickly will definitely force them to shelve some of the more extreme ambitions I suspect. In a weird way I was almost hoping they did get their predicted landslide victory so they could let their own hubris destroy any chance of a two-term government.
38. while I get the joke (and will laugh) I disagree. I don't find it funny at all. Having one side in power for 30 odd years is not good for democracy. It's about time the LNP in Qld pulled their heads out of their asses and had a real look at who they want to be as a party
39. There's a chance of a Katter ALP coalition maybe. Labor coalition'd with them in 2010 during the Rudd/Gillard government. They are a socialist party after all.
40. Yeah, the one thing you can always count on the LNP doing is allowing the unfettered power that comes with the unicameral system to fuck up their second term chances.
41. Hey, I work in the public service and it definitely needs a clean out. Efficiency is a dirty word in the service.
42. Yeah, but the poll was conducted over the past week, so the ALP still have a fighting chance.
43. Yep good point. A prime example of why early voting shouldn’t exist IMO.
44. They'll have wound back mining royalties, devastated investment in green energy and trashed Queensland health for Labor to fix. "...and since I'd achieved all of my goals as [Premier] in one term, there was no need for a second."
45. I just want abortion equality If 2000 women can't have one, then 2000 women should be forced to have them. That's fair for all. Or they could just let them decide for themselves
46. Haha, a couple of by-elections over four years isn’t completely outside the realm of possibility.
47. I watched a snippet of the debate and he explicitly said abortion laws will not change. Unless I am missing something, he has basically fulfilled exactly what you said.
48. So you have a lazy $50k to drop on a bet?
49. Don’t all polls have margins of error? Guess we’ll have to wait and see
50. I mean a few weeks ago it was paying $26, so I have seen more skewed odds haha
51. No. You can vote greens 1 and Labor 2 and your vote will still count the same for Labor if greens don't make it in as if Labor was 1 on your ballot
52. The only time this matters is if your seat is a close race between greens and Labor. If you live in an electorate like that, you may want to consider if it would be better to vote Labor 1st so that they don't lose a seat to the greens. That's very few electorates though, and even with that you may prefer the green candidate. Otherwise no, your vote will move down your list as numbered.
53. Like it's pretty well know that just punishing youth offenders more doesn't work - Crissafulli just wants QLD to turn into a US Red State, complete with a high recidivism rate from adults who were traumatised by the carceral system as kids.
54. Surely he put it forward to weaken the LNP, giving himself a better chance at having real power in helping the LNP to form parliament?
55. Unfortunately they can indeed still do a lot of damage. They aren’t out of the woods on their own though, they still have to be the ones to make the call about knocking down the Gabba and the school next door, somehow finding money for all the commitments that they’ve made especially around roads, outlining how they’ll pay for their non existent pumped hydro plan and a bunch of other big ticket items all seemingly without billions in coal royalties. If they cut the public service like Newman, they’re fucked. If they cut infrastructure spending they’re fucked (many of the biggest infrastructure projects are in marginal seats), if they cut 50c fares or energy rebates they’re fucked. Labor have been pretty smart in setting their own cost of living “booby traps” which directly help people and will massively hurt the LNP if wound back. The shadow treasurer was already floundering in front of the media yesterday when he released their miserable “costings”, budget time is going to be very interesting because nobody seems to know where they’ll find the money.
56. They'd need to promote a mayor to premier to do that, wouldn't they?
57. No they didn’t. In 2010, Katter supported Abbott. Oakeshott, Windsor, Wilkie and Bandt gave Gillard a majority.
58. A socialist party? Katter? Can you show me exactly where in their manifesto they say they want the working class to own the means of production? Also the ALP won't make coalition with them because they've campaigned off the back of this abortion bill the Katter party wants to get through.
59. I always feel like qld lnp behaviour is like, let's let Labor build up the state, then when we win once every 10 years, let's just ransack the place as though we won the lottery and when we lose the next election, it's ok we're all set for the next 10 years. Let Labor build up the place again and then we can rinse and repeat.
60. what a weird reason for the reason why ur an opponent of early voting lmfao.. why not just have the polls include an additional questions asking if the person has already voted (early)?
61. Let's just fine everyone who works on election day and prevent them from voting, or start engaging in the voter suppression of the US. What could possibly go wrong?
62. oh i know its going to fucking suck, Labor voter here, but just trying to look for the tiny tiny positives in what i am still expecting going to be a shit 4 years
63. oh i fully agree with abortion rights, but i also expect the LNP to be idiots, and not realise how badly they will get crucified for restricting them, because it is definitely appearing to be a wider trend among countries that Abortion is becoming increasingly popular among the general populace
64. or a couple of LNPs turning into Independents, KAPS or Palmers or whatever
65. “It’s not part of our plan” is so obviously weasel words to technically not lie, in the event that a private member bill gets introduced and then he allows a conscience vote. Just too bad for him that everyone (well almost everyone I guess) saw through it immediately. What he needed to do is say he wouldn’t allow a conscience vote on the matter, or at least be more definite in his response (e.g. the law will not be changed under the LNP vs it’s not part of our plan).
66. “It’s not part of our plan” means “I’ll let Katter introduce the bill and call for a conscience vote while knowing full well pretty much all my guys will vote to criminalise abortion”.
67. He said that the laws will not change but refused to say whether it will be a conscience vote on any bills initiated. It was LNP party policy in 2018 not to vote for the currently existing laws. Unless the whole party has flipped its position in just 6 years it’s likely that the rest of the party will vote for changes to repeal such laws even if he says that the laws will not change now
68. the YouGov one i looked at did [https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/201024\_QLD\_Public\_Polling\_Methodology\_Statement.pdf](https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/201024_QLD_Public_Polling_Methodology_Statement.pdf) so give or take 3.1% from the results. this survey had ALP 10% behind LNP for both the primary vote and the two-party-preferred-vote. you can see the survey results without going through a courier mail pay wall here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024\_Queensland\_state\_election#Opinion\_polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Queensland_state_election#Opinion_polling) (10–16 October 2024 - YouGov) feel free to check it out, maybe i missed something and you can cyber-bully me for being a gay retard.
69. Definitely, or at least to force the LNP's hand on the topic.
70. That was my thinking. Katter also wanted to be Deputy and Acting Premier.
71. I agree. Miles has left a minefield of booby traps to spring on LNP. Miles may not be charismatic like Ana, but this guy is bold and smart even when he's destined to lose. Why didn't Ana step down earlier for Miles!?
72. Ahhh Tony Windsor was a bloody giant. Was a sad day when he stepped down. Rob Oakeshott turned a bloody safe National seat into a national seat... Bloody brilliant too.
73. Katter is a weird one, actively calls himself an [agrarian socialist](https://theconversation.com/bob-katter-the-man-with-friends-in-odd-places-12809), is progressive in some social topics but also incredibly conservative in others. To reuse an old comment of mine. >He is not a fan of gay marriage, but very [aggressively attacked](https://www.thenewdaily.com.au/news/politics/australian-politics/2021/11/12/bob-katter-voter-id-laws) the LNP (our major conservative coalition) for attempting to introduce voter ID laws, rightly calling them out as a racist attack on marginalised communities. >He is an [active member of the Construction, Forestry and Maritime Employees Union and spends significant political effort push back on attacks to both union representation and attempts to reduce site safety requirements](https://web.archive.org/web/20200416143209/https://www.bobkatter.com.au/media/letters/view/729/katter-almost-a-death-a-week-on-a-construction-site-in-australia-and-you-want-to-crucify-the-cfmeu/media-releases). He consistently votes against [privatising government-owned assets](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/people/representatives/kennedy/bob_katter/policies/21), [increasing consumer protections](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/people/representatives/kennedy/bob_katter/policies/45) and vote [government administered paid parental leave](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/people/representatives/kennedy/bob_katter/policies/5). >He actively calls himself an [agrarian socialist](https://theconversation.com/bob-katter-the-man-with-friends-in-odd-places-12809) and split with the conservative National party due to their turn into [neoliberal economic policies](https://www.tallyroom.com.au/9528#)
74. Think of a parallel universe where the national party wasn't bought out and corrupted by mining and big business. That's pretty much what the Katter family represent and why they'll always be voted in by their voters. Traditional (not conservative) values, socialist, old school Christians (not prosperity bs).
75. You can look on their website, they're pro renewable energy, pro union, want more public transport, anti privatisation, forests to be open to everyone, higher immigration into Northern Australia, anti monopoly. But they're also pro gun and extremely Christian because that's the people they represent.
76. Dumb question here, but how much of the farms in Queensland are family owned and operated? KAP are pretty into farmers and stuff, I hear
77. Sorry? How is suggesting that polls shouldn’t open until all of the campaigning has concluded in case key developments arise (eg. LNP MPs saying they are secretly going to push to change abortion laws after the election) a weird reason?
78. Not suggesting that extreme approach at all. But I think it’s reasonable to question timeframes. Current early voting period of a fortnight exists in Qld — is that the best option for people to make an informed decision? Arguably, a lot has happened within the past two weeks, so I’d be interested to know how many of the 1 million + votes that have already been cast would be different now knowing what we know.
79. Excellent analysis, but I'll bully you for your use of the last two words there bud...
80. Polls are definitely an interesting subject coming into this. Labor seems to be progressing by the day against LNP and your typical swing voter won’t be early voting. Guessing it’s gonna get closer and closer as we keep progressing. Who’d ya have down for the metro electorates?
81. Really? They are so bad you can’t even give me one bad thing?
82. She’s Labor Right and he’s Labor Left. People forget that Labor isn’t one homogeneous entity.
83. Point of order. Can we leave off the US politics and ‘touchpoints’ seeping into Australia language, and this QLD election. Also, we don’t say ‘booby’. We say “tits”, or “tits up”. Although to be fair, “tits trap” for the LNP could be misinterpreted.
84. Yeah right. How odd. Thanks for the info. I can't say I know too much about the party but some of that stuff sounds good.
85. I have a theory that if Katter was better at growing & managing a party (it seems a lot of his political instincts that served him well as an independent don’t carry across into this other area so well), the KAP could devastate the Nationals in their heartland regional seats. The Nats are so completely controlled by large corporate interests and their candidates are so clearly just cosplaying a being part of the region (Matt Canavan is perhaps the most egregious example) that if they could get organised, get some proper party infrastructure in place and get their candidate selection sorted properly, a hell of a lot of those seats would be very much in play. I can acknowledge that this is partly hopeful thinking (as someone of the far left of the Labour party, they would be a hell of a step up from the Nat’s), but these seats aren't falling to labour or the greens anytime soon, and it’s hard to imagine these communities are happy with the job the nationals are doing, constantly selling them out the moment that a corporation wants anything.
86. yeah the KAP is just a bit weird because they are genuinely representative of their electorates, like i don't agree with the KAP, but can't deny that they do work in the interests of the people who vote for them
87. Wasn't Katter the one railing against wind turbines? "A wall of death up and down QLD." ??
88. Yeah right. I get that these things are associated with socialism, but the core of it, is workers owning the means of production and the abolition of private property. I doubt the Katters want either. Therefore it's just a weird mix of progressive conservatism.
89. I get your reasoning, but the practicality for early/postal/phone voting is that there are plenty of valid reasons why a subset of the population simply can't make it to a vote on the day itself. And it's not like other parties aren't bound by the same rules and can't hold off announcing things themselves until it is politically advantageous to do so. It would be nice if the LNP had a few more weeks to keep shooting themselves in the foot but that's just life. I just don't think doing away with early voting is worth it.
90. find someone who is dumb enough to bet against Labor in Woodridge. that's going nowhere. [https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/qld/2024/guide/wood](https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/qld/2024/guide/wood)
91. Ignore them. They’re always on here, one time they said that they didn’t feel the effects of the Liberal gutting of public services in 2012. Told other nurses here who were laid off that they were ‘shit’ and ‘probably not good at their jobs anyway.’ Gives off big “well I wasn’t affected therefore others didn’t have it as bad !” energy.
