Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. A lot of people have relatives who are alive today because of those decisions that otherwise wouldn’t be. Fuck off with your “audacity” bullshit - people would genuinely empathise with your position because, truly, it was a shit one and for me personally I’m sorry you had to go through that, but lives were saved because of it. Could there have been more empathy in an exemption process, managed in such a way to ensure public safety but also respect people’s needs? Abso-fucking-lutely. But you’re going to get shitcanned when you say Labor failed COVID management because _they didn’t_. Also, fuck you for supporting the LNP who will absolutely sell out our state and roll back individual rights.
2. They’re all butthurt lefties who tried to sway the election with scare tactics and false narratives over the last few weeks here in this sub. It didn’t work. ALP lost fair and square. Deal with it like adults. Nearly need to leave a box of tissues here for you all.

4. Abusing someone for having a differing view to yourself, that doesn’t seem healthy. Head outside and get some vitamin B, it’s good for the body and mind.
5. Katter confirmed last night on ABC he's still coming for abortion.
6. Ok so Bob Katter said that... not the LNP. So my original comment stands as does your paranoia
7. LNP has a slim majority and is made up of both social progressives and social conservatives. Even if a conscience vote is allowed, there are too many progressives for the vote to get up. I don’t understand why people are freaking out over this.
8. Exactly.. it was Katter. Not the LNP. The LNP would surely know its political suicide to try and change that.
9. I highly doubt they are going to risk another term by doing this. The topic was thrust on them, not brought up by them.
10. Good insult shit head 💀, Definitely not smart enough to know what Ad hominem is
11. There was a place in the valley called the family planning clinic.
12. 50 is a gen X. Be careful who you call out.
13. they are a moron trying to launder far right talking points, that is their aim
14. not my list - it's from [Countries Where Abortion Is Illegal 2024](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/countries-where-abortion-is-illegal) but point was to highlight that the USA doesn't "ban" it. that's a falsity (even though OP didn't explicitly state it) and that other countries do - so if one is unhappy with the USA the one should be more unhappy with those countries and say so.
15. The great stripping of online comments begins it seems… 😂😁
16. Tim Nicholls Clayfield voted with Labour for decrim. I dont know who the other two were
17. Oh that's right she got voted out 2020 but was in before that! I totally forgot that. I used to live in that seat and voted against her twice I should remember lol. In that case maybe she's not as moderate as I thought. I'm glad you dug into that.
18. Is that the first time an election promise has been broken before the election even happened? Lol
19. Youth crime is already falling. If you look at the actual statistics it’s the lowest it’s been in 20 years. My partner is a police officer and he agrees it’s not an issue. Each area may have a few kids who cause the ‘majority’ of youth crime. It’s not as out of control as the media makes out. So it will ‘fall’ and he won’t need to resign. Empty promise to make.
20. > if youth crime doesn't fall It's been falling 'per capita' for a decade or so, but not in raw numbers - we've been growing faster than it's falling. Couldn't have that come out too early in the campaign though.
21. At least he back-pedalled before the election, not after it.
22. We’re talking about two different people here. You’re talking about David.
23. For all the complaints about Senate obstruction there is value in having one when it comes to removing the extremes from the legislation process
24. Whoever the fuck decided fixed 4 year terms in a parliament with 1 chamber is a good idea is absolutely nuts. Oh wait, it was the whole of qld 💀
25. Did you catch when she had to stop talking and change what she was about to say?
26. Amanda Stoker also got pissed at abc questions about abortion. They thanked her for her time she she said "seeya!" with what I thought was a menacing smile lol
27. There are US evangelicals that directly fund anti-abortion groups here. It's not just that the locals are 'inspired' by the US precedents.
28. In America you can safe drop your child, no questions asked. Here you go to jail for 7 years. If they are going to make abortion illegal they need to make child safe drop legal.
29. I don’t get it, abortion laws don’t affect those that disagree because those that don’t agree with abortion can still go ahead with their pregnancies! And like my hubby says, no man gets a say in a woman’s body decisions… why is this so hard to understand in the 21st century
30. Let the north go. Seriously become its own state. In fact I’ll help with the campaigning.
31. A person I spoke to yesterday said it best - you can’t criminalise abortion, you can only criminalise _safe_ abortion.
32. No it would be Katter's can't you read? It's like a baby bird as long as I get it in there before it sees me it will imprint on him when he goes to grab the paper.
33. The particular brand of copium I'm on today is telling me they didn't want to commit either way in case they needed KAP support to form government. But time will tell I guess
34. By cancel the Olympics did you mean push all the budget blowouts to shell and construction companies associated with them and their friends? If so you would be correct. How people can’t see a pattern that’s happened 100x times before with this party I’ll never know
35. It should be taught in high school along with things like taxation and life skills. ... In a perfect world
36. Ummm. Nah. [Economic and Fiscal Overview - Queensland Budget 2024-25](https://budget.qld.gov.au/overview/economic-and-fiscal-overview/#:~:text=RESPONSIBLE%20BUDGET%20MANAGEMENT%20%E2%80%93%20FISCAL%20OVERVIEW&text=A%20strong%20net%20operating%20surplus,in%20the%202023%E2%80%9324%20Budget.) >**A strong net operating surplus of $564 million is expected for 2023–24 compared to the deficit of $2.182 billion estimated in the 2023–24 Budget**. This estimated outcome is the result of careful management of revenue improvements, including royalties and taxes, so that a surplus has been achieved at the same time as providing additional electricity bill support for Queensland households and small businesses in 2024–25. **The 2023–24 estimated actual represents the third consecutive operating surplus of this term of government and follows a record surplus of $13.9 billion in 2022–23.**
37. hey hey, boomsauce is back getting basic facts wrong again everyone!
38. Wow, running a state is expensive! Who'd have thought? And I wonder how that could be paid back? Maybe with some of the ~8bn/yr from royalties? Jesus Christ you people love to wank off over capitalism, but apparently only private sector concerns can do things like take out loans and get finance for things. The moment the public sector does it, you piss your pants and squeal like someone stole your copy of Atlas Shrugged.
39. Thanks for taking the time to reply, and with all that info too. Yeah that makes a lot more sense. Yeah I agree it would seem a bit mad to touch those higher surcharges, well particularly the $300 one. At least at that point both the mining companies and the government would be making big money, win for everybody. Actually makes me wonder if they’d have to raise the levels of those lower thresholds ($150 and $175) eventually if there was cost inflation and production costs started to rise towards those levels. I guess it could make sense to leave them for thermal coal if a government wants to phase that out eventually, but presumably Queensland will want to keep exporting met coal for a long time yet.
40. There's a lot of dumb reactionary bogans who genuinely vote directly against their self interest though :S
41. Sadly you are probably 100% on the money. Another sign of the 2 tier society we are now living in where those that won’t notice and voted for this will at worse walk away with even more (just a little though), where as those that can’t afford to live, will find it harder and harder as the rich start pulling back any support they may have given to ensure the “user pays” system comes into effect.
42. Except that's not how parliamentary debate happens. The only way something comes up for debate and vote is if the manager of government business and/or the speaker allows it to be. It would only happen if the powers that be within the Coalition government want it. Only THEN do the members of the coalition have the freedom to vote according to the conscience, if that's what the party decides is appropriate in the situation.
43. Time to make a change where SEQ doesn't pay for NQ choices and SPLIT QUEENSLAND https://www.reddit.com/r/queensland/s/2KUNEmXAnZ
44. There is very little the state gov can do to ease the cost of living. The main cause is inflation and that's part of a global issue with the reserve bank and feral govt holding some levers to try to control it. The tough times we are facing at all from the Covid lockdowns and all the money that was printed. The consequences of those lockdowns is now being fully felt. The next couple years will be tough no matter who is in govt.
45. Likely, but I think Labor won't bounce back that hard, because they lost a lot of margin fat but not many seats. Hopefully it's not Newman 2.0 (but Crisafulli can't possibly be that dumb, when his whole campaign was we won't be that dumb). Their best bet is to be incremental, establish that they can govern on a few promises and deal with whatever policy curve ball hits this term. The one advantage they have is that they under promised like crazy and still snuck home, which could be a boon in disguise for them, because the more vocal ideologues can now be shit down by moderates if they exist. Ironically, I think their blueprint for the next four years is not that dissimilar to who they kicked out - softly, slowly and deliberately, without boasting. The more you try to beat on the other side, the worse it will get, because they can just say you don't remember how to govern.
46. That and their pet newspapers will tell people they've fixed the problem. It's politics on easy mode.
47. Labor’s response that crime had decreased is disingenuous though and that’s the problem. It’s not down, it’s down in some areas, but it’s up significantly in assaults, b&e and motor theft relative to the previous 4 years. Absolutely the LNP and right wing media’s hennypennying is bad, but Labor and the Guardian’s “there’s nothing to see here everything is fine” response is equally as bad as it makes people align with the LNP because what Labor is saying is not people’s reality on the ground. The LNP and rw media then play to that mistake. The AFR did a survey a few weeks back and 46% of people had been a victim of crime in the past year or directly knew someone that had been. People’s experience was just doesn’t align with what the government were telling them, and that’s always a recipe for a bad time for a government
48. Crime can be lower but still too high You can try and target poor kids at risk before they turn to crime while at the same time punish those who commit serious offences
49. Again, just because you don’t react to something some way, doesn’t mean others will be fine with it too. You have so much empathy for the petty criminals, try having some for the victims too, who are often not going to be as resilient as you. Fear is the problem here and you saying “you shouldn’t be scared because I’m not” comes across as dismissive for people who have different experiences than you, in the same way you’re upset people aren’t considering your experiences. Also, youth crime is not significantly down in assaults, breaking and entering and motor theft and you have to stop saying it is because it doesn’t help your case. The stats don’t support you unless you lump “all crime” in there — all crime is not the problem, the problem is specifically the things I listed and they are what people see. And there is a need to treat *some* of these kids more forcefully than others, not so much putting them into adult prisons but being able to keep them out of society for a while because with no ability for sentencing for high risk offenders many will take it that the law is not a risk for them and they will just do it again… until they are *are* adults at which time they have a mindset they can get away with anything and then they get proper sentences - which is not good for them. This is the whole thing, not being able to treat any of them differently to the others despite different offenders carrying different types of risk is silly. For some of them, their actions are extreme enough that they need to be separated from society, regardless of how sad their upbringing is. The challenge is how do you do it in away that rehabilitates rather than just punishes. And that is a long term problem. And most of the voters evidently think you can’t just say “ah well it might be better in 20 years” they want to feel safe now. And people wanting to feel safe in their own home is a powerful motivator and not a stupid one at all.
50. I’ve just moved back to Townsville from Brisbane. Our “nice home in a nice suburb” in Brisbane had multiple break ins - seperate occasions my partner had his car vandalised - had his plates stolen - all these things cost us money and time. We have ring doorbells and cameras and provide everything for the police yet all we got back every single time was we don’t know exactly who did this so the case is archived. I barely sleep anymore. The dog sneezes and I’m on high alert, the wind will even wake me up now and good luck going back to sleep. My justice or peace is not some child with no consequences and a fed belly. My grandmother who I’ve moved back in with to look after works for the Townsville juvie and even she says the kids aren’t getting better. They’re more brazen and some even spit at her and all she does is their laundry. Very grateful we live out in the sticks even by Townsville standards How long can you expect people to watch themselves, their friends and their families be victims of crimes where there is either no culprit found or the culprit is found and gets at most a stern talking to and then do it again A 5 year old child in cairns got a fractured skull by a boy who was already facing 9 other chargers prior to throwing the rock How long do you expect people to “trust the process” before actually getting angry and wanting real things done about it? I didn’t even vote LNP first but I think these takes on crime really do delegitimise people’s genuine concerns for their safety
51. Wow. One wonders if next they'll try to sue organisations tackling teenage alcohol use, for the same reason (pregnancy). Or if they'll sue each states' education department for educating girls **at all**, given the inverse link between a society's female education rates and teen pregnancy.
52. Good on you! That must have taken a lot of work, and I'm glad you had that mentorship available. A lot of people are acting like jailing kids will teach them respect and self-worth, when it's actually the complete opposite. Yet without respect for others and respect/self-worth for themselves, nothing is gonna change for these kids and they'll just dig the hole deeper.
53. > What helped me was having decent support at school, proactive interactions from teachers and members of the community, and as an adult, a lot of therapy. Which is precisely where the primary focus should be - proactive interventions to stop criminals becoming criminals in the first place. QPS should not be the first line of defence!
54. How is letting an attempted murder during a break in walk away without incarceration the best result of the justice system? You can treat poverty at the same time as punishing crime, they aren't exclusive Majority of people know right from wrong, and making excuses for people is gaslighting the victims and quite frankly insulting
55. If they have nothing to lose, hand over their freedom to roam the streets and get back to me
56. I've been to far too many epic parties to ever be allowed to run for parliment
57. Singapore (with one of the lowest crime rate in the world) may disagree with you. They use strict punishments as a deterrent for committing crimes and it seems to work.
58. Seems like the parents need jail if their under age kids are committing violence or property theft. They should at least be automatically financially responsible for the damage and secondary effects. Working decades in retail, I've never seen bad kids that didn't have enabling parents. Adult crime, parents do time.
59. And they are repealing those laws in the US after realising that they were inhumane.
60. What? The comment said LNP was voted in because of people like Debbie, but literally up until the day before the election people said Debbies were made up and an agenda pushed by the media. So which is it? Debbie’s are made up or Debbie’s voted in the LNP?
61. she’s not old enough. she’s only 62 so they told us to rely on ndis. ndis are saying that her diagnosis isn’t strong enough. they don’t believe us that she’s about as capable of caring for herself as a newborn, even with ex phys, gp, O.T backing. the neurologist hasn’t got a concrete diagnosis so we’re on our own
62. Ramping in Qld is the worst in the country, currently.
63. And cut mining royalties which were funding some of the hospital upgrades!
64. You're blaming a party that has been in power for 3 of the last 30 years? Instead of the one who's been in power for 27 years, including the last decade, for the state of the health system? That's truely delusional.
65. Our local base hospital in one area has a short wait list. It is always within the acceptable number of patients. A specialist we saw was lamenting that he has waiting to have their referrals opened for extended periods. I didn't get it, until he explained they are fudging wait times by not opening new referrals until one clears their system to make the statistics look better. Literally they are putting peoples lives at risk to give good reports on wait times. I'm not saying this is common, but its a sad state of affairs that this is what people have to do.
66. That’s the problem. Everyone is like LNP will only make one term when everyone realises what a dumb decision they made but 4 years is enough time to absolutely wreak havoc.
67. Energy rebates, 50c public transport, and reduced vehicle registration were brought in by Miles. Mining royalties were raised that help fund public infrastructure. Mining companies pay very little comparative to profits. It's Australia's land, and international companies reap the rewards. I know the state doesn't control interest rates. I meant we are coming into a better economic period due to factors outside of what state LNP would have caused. But they will take the credit and push the narrative that they are superior. Labor brought us through and out of the pandemic.
68. If you read my comment after I said this one, I know the RBA controls interest rates you highly regarded person. My point is that rate cuts are coming and the LNP will claim benefits. Do you think the average LNP voter knows the difference between state and federal governments?
69. Yes, I know this is a federal issue. I addressed this in my next comment. The average LNP voter will not understand the difference when LNP jumps up and down about the cost of living stabilising and interest rates dropping. This probably won't happen anyway as LNP (Federal) wants to keep immigration high.
70. It’s the only state with universally free ambulance too - even Tasmania has criteria where they sometimes will issue a bill to its own residents.
71. >*"NOOoNOOOO NOOOOURR NOURRR* >*I NEVA LEAVE MY HOUSEE SO NURBURD CURS ABURT URRTSS FURNDINGGGG I HAF DIS FING CULD A CUMPUTR N FISSBOOK WE DURN NEED IT!!!!!!"*
72. As a reminder, if you get an ambulance bill from any other state as well, you can send it to QAS, _and [they will pay it](https://www.qld.gov.au/emergency/emergencies-services/interstate-ambulance-treatment)_. This is unique to Queensland - even Tasmania won’t pay your ambo invoice if you get one from, say, QAS.
73. Bro, the level of environmental destruction is going to be absolutely wild. When you look back at the levels it was under newman and then where it came down to, they are going to have to 10x it just to get back to where it was back then. They are going to absolutely hog wild it will be crazy rofl
74. And insect numbers are plummeting alarmingly. And also spiders. Every year in my parents yard for the last 40 years we had heaps of golden orb weavers. I haven't seen any for two years now. I've seen one single brown beetle in two years, never seen a Christmas beetle. And we live in a regional area! I look at the caterpillars in the garden and wonder if they're a fucking endangered species :S
75. i said, that is everywhere regardless of what party is in, when i said everywhere i meant qld.
76. I bet they all love the fireworks & jet flyovers… Part of the Brisbane Festival. Funded by STATE & Local Government 🙄
77. I can guarantee you that the many who rail against tax-funded cultural infrastructure are the same people who complain about our lack of nightlife.
78. Ah another mindless redditor who thinks someone who votes conservative must be a Christian!!
79. were pretty dumb as a nation though, we voted for austerity in 1996 and haven't looked back since
80. That's the thing though. I grew up on the Gold coast, there's heaps of poor cunts who are super conservative there too. They vote against their best interests, it's so bizarre to me.
81. Yep. 4 is probably going to be the main focus of a lot of local branches over the coming months.
82. Simultaneously both all powerful, and powerless. It’s a rhetoric that seems very familiar if you look out over the Pacific Ocean.
83. He actually said this I’m paraphrasing go watch it on YouTube
84. Lmao hahahahah race wasn't part of my thinking. In my area there are heaps of white kids breaking into things and stealing cars. Great way to show yourself as a racist
85. Oh absolutely. That's why I said 'typically' not every or all
86. That's true but that is like saying that the younger generation have parents and grandparents and voting LNP would be better for them. Of course this is very general and your point stands for the abortion debate alone.
87. Yeah, I’m at Griffith so I can only get the 50% fares through TransLink by registering as a tertiary student. Helps a bit, but not much when I’m going through 3 zones. Appreciate the tip, hopefully someone else who can take advantage of it sees it.
88. Wow, legit haven't heard. I can't find anything googling though - do you know who's mentioned it?
89. Yeah, I don't think it's SUPER likely, but I'm just thinking of the worst case scenario. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
90. Again thered no steps to do either of these things so stop being so dramatic about something that may never happen.
91. sure mate, watch the next 4 year feel just the same if not better or slightly worse than the previous.
92. They very much have stated it many times since the issue arose. I have heard those words clearly out of DC mouth more than once. Several times in the last week. Along with Katter saying they weren't going to put in a private members bill. That it had no priority to KAP. What part of "we will not be changing any abortion or VAD laws" don't you understand? And "no laws on Abortion will change during our term of government" and "we have no intention of changing any laws in abortion" Not sure how they could be much clearer? Along with several other LNP pollies, including Ros Bates. The LNP NEVER bought up this entire nonsense. It was Robbie Katter.
