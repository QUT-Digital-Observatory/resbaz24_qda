Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. IMHO The Greens are driving themselves into oblivion, they either present policies that they cant pay for like free school lunches or closing all the coal mines... or they oppose everything the majors (or at least the LNP) propose. What do they stand for? I'm pissed off at the Greens because they can drive real change by compromising, but they wont/cant for fear of losing their core 9.5% of the electorate whose votes pay for them, and who don't want them to compromise. Like great, close all coal mines in QLD, OK where do you get the revenue to cover one third of the budget, while simultaneously finding another 2 billion a year to pay for school lunches. people aren't stupid.
2. Anyone who voted greens saw what Labor was doing and worked to back that. Meanwhile the Greens divided many people, their RBA demands, not sending patients to hospitals that don't perform abortions, are two very unpopular stances.
3. Labor forgot their bread and butter, the working poor. 1. Most low income workers do not work in the cbd or live/work close enough to trains and bus stations to make 50c fares a viable cost cutting measure, also many low income workers rely on their vehicle as a tool of their trade. 2. 20% rego discounts do not help if you can’t afford to pay 12 months at a time. Which most people on the bread line cannot afford. To inner city dinks, these seem like wonderful gestures, and it’s nice to think that the poors can now afford to visit Southbank on the weekend, the reality is that the working poor continue to cop it in the arse while welfare recipients and middle class get the treats. To top it off, Feds pulled the only windfall struggling people had to get back on their feet each year in the tax LMITO.
4. I thought labor saw what the greens were saying about school lunches which was taken from the US VP candidate (which obviously has been getting promoted world wide) who did it in his home state. Hence being able to cite the impact not just being an idea. He in turn probably got it somewhere else but that is the flow from where I heard it. The VP dude, then the Greens before Labor.
5. The far left greens have use in our country and the people have spoken. Congratulations everybody who voted with their heads.
6. The greens don't focus on their policies. They are professional devils advocates...always taking a position just to try to get a little screen time. Standing with the CFMEU had a huge negative impact on them as well as Palestine etc. perceived support is not the same as support when people have that ballet paper in their hands.
7. I live in what was a safe Labor seat with a minister who hasn't had a good four years. Apart from the obvious (put FFP last and ONP second last), it was surprisingly tough for me to order the top three. Rewarding poor performance felt bad, the Oppo candidate hadn't done anything to sway me and I had reservations on her views, and the Green's candidate was unimpressive when we talked. Labor may have benefited from the Greens not looking great at the moment, people still squinting at the Libs for Campbell, and a decent campaign to save the furniture in the Brisbane and satellites area plus a desire to not landslide another Newman government in (so we trusted the regions to do the dirty work for us.) We now have a deeply divide state - Brisbane/Logan/Ipswich/Redlands/MBC on one side, and GC, SC, Toowoomba and rest of QLD on the other. Not sure what it means electorally; does Labor need a country party ally to run against the Nats, if they've become the party of Sydmeladperbrisho? Do the Greens want to be that party (or a reformed LCP/SXP) or do they want to be the party of uni students and inner city residents (nothing wrong with that if that's what they want, just asking the question of their goals), as far from the environment they wish to protect as is possible, ironically? If they don't, who is taking up the farmer's role to counter the miner's party? Is it KAP as a less conservative, agrarian-social rural party?
8. "Letting the perfect be the enemy of the good" should be their party motto. I used to vote for them on principle and Labor 2nd but they've shown their incompetence too many times now. Went Cannabis-Labor this time.
9. Completely agree. My electorate is most likely to go green (a toss up between Greens and LNP, who’d have thought?) but our candidate didn’t show up as much as I’d have liked. Part of the problem is the changes LNP and ALP made in the “protecting democracy act” (bullshit) which made it harder for third parties to get enough revenue to compete via advertisement etc. I saw like 2 greens ads the entire election campaign, and maybe 200 ALP/LNP ones. It’s also very true that many of labours most popular policies are just adapted greens policies, and many of them (especially regarding housing!) wouldn’t have happened if Greens hadn’t pushed labour over and over again. They need to cut the shit and focus their energy on showing everyone that their policies are popular.
10. So true. They have a inability to look at their own behaviour. I was thinking of voting for them but after they backed the CFMEU I thought they were crazy 😧
11. The greens were the ones who also pushed Labor for the national vaping bans which are a complete and utter failure on every level..
12. I mean, this is me every time. Voting is always just trying to figure out the lesser of two (or more) evils and working backwards. At what point are political parties going to actually represent anyone?
13. I just looked at the results on the ABC. Literally every seat but 3 had a swing to the LNP. The ALP needed to campaign in every seat because clearly the baseball bats were out for them.
14. It’s even weirder because he seems to be suggesting that labor should’ve just given up and handed over McConnell, Cooper and Greenslopes? No one party is entitled to any seat and those seats they had their eyes on were all labor seats so even if the greens had won, Crisafulli would still be premier.
15. I live in Berkman's electorate. There's no way ALP were going to win here so Greens and ALP taking pot shots at each other only serves to swing people to LNP.
16. Also, hasn't this been the Greens strategy forever??? Didn't they deliberately go after Jackie Trad last state election?
17. I often hear this about what the ALP say but I think the more general criticism from them toward Green's members is the constant posturing and scrutiny that seems almost entirely one sided.
18. As a Greens volunteer on Max's campaign in 2022. We got yelled at by Labor volunteers because it was "antifeminist" to be campaigning so hard in a safe Labor seat where a woman was the elected official. So yes, Labor are guilty of this. What gets me though, I had Labor volunteers tell me the only way to guarantee women's rights was to vote for Labor. Miles said himself he'd rather an LNP government than form a minority with the Greens. But don't you think if Labor were genuine about protecting reproductive rights, they'd have preferenced the party that consistently supports progressive change and will always protect a woman's right to choose? To me, Labor seemed completely disingenuous about this because they preferenced the LNP over the Greens in a number of seats. So their actions tell me they don't support Greens values, such as reproductive rights, the free kids lunches, greater access to affordable healthcare.... Oh wait, those are also Labor policies, that the Greens would have supported... So what the hell are Labor doing? If they wanted to achieve these things they possibly could have if they weren't so staunch about throwing the Greens in the trash. Anyway, that's my thoughts. I am an avid Greens supporter who preferences Labor obviously, so I am feeling let down by their strong arm tactics. I know Miles is a unit, but come on.
19. Well maybe you should write to Bandt and MCM, as a member.
20. I’ve been voting green, then labor for the last decade or so (and did again this election) not because I agree with all the greens policies but I’ve wanted Labor to flow more left. I’m glad it has started to happen, not sure where this leaves the greens…
21. The Greens aren't exactly going to be governing in their own right any time soon, so *the whole point* is for them to have enough influence to pull the ruling parties to the left, and the fact that that's what they did - to the point of Labor straight-up copying their policies - is a success to be celebrated, surely?
22. That's exactly why I voted Greens. I know they won't get in, but I want to encourage Labor left as strongly as possible. There's no way they would be implementing progressive policies like public transport and school lunches without encouragement from people voting progressively.
23. That’s exactly what they’re doing. But major parties only adopt greens ideas if it looks like residents will otherwise vote Greens. That’s why there’s a sudden ‘progressive’ shift by qld labor in a historically conservative state.
24. Of course, but in order to keep being relevant you may need excuses about "bad" election results. If the story is just "the greens are unpopular" that's quite different to "green ideas are popular."
25. Agreed. We need more political parties on both sides that adhere to pragmatism.
26. Except these good ideas were proposed by the greens for more than a decade. Even in 2020 labor was laughing off cheap public transport as lunacy. Even in 2022 labor voted against free school lunches, saying there was no evidence it was needed.
27. The issue is giving credit. I might be sensitive to this topic as a woman, because history is littered with examples of men taking credit for women's work (eg. Watson and Crick instead of Rosalind Franklin, Charles Babbage instead of Ada Lovelace, Scott F Fitzgerald instead of Zelda Fitzgerald) but it's important to acknowledge where ideas come from.
28. I normally vote Greens, but Miles has honestly been doing exactly as they say - implementing policies that are Green-aligned. So I voted Labor in an attempt to send a stronger message. The Greens have become a little too extremist in my eyes over the last few years. Either that or I've become more of a realist.
29. This is a great take. Greens senators are excellent. I still miss Ludlum :(
30. Yes, this is one of the reasons I really wish Queensland would re-introduce an upper house. Not only would it potentially act as a check upon the lower house, which I think is really vital, but it would also give smaller parties a chance to participate more in the parliamentary process. In other words, a bicameral parliament would not only introduce greater accountability but would introduce a greater variety of voices and, in a democracy, I think that's a really important thing to have.
31. We have a preferential voting system; people shouldn't be voting somebody to stop somebody else getting in. No, the KAP learned the lesson that The Greens should have from their end of the spectrum. The LNP started adopting the KAP's policies, so they threw out Abortion to win back Right Wing votes from the LNP and push the overton window further right. What The Greens should have done when Labor began adopting their policies was campaign for even further left ideals and make new policies to push the overton window left. Instead, they sat there and complained as sore losers.
32. worth noting they do it in the ACT quite well (labour greens coalition just got voted in again). very different playing field but I sometimes wonder how much of the "greens don't negotiate" line is Murdoch propaganda.
33. The Greens party itself is so disorganised I'm surprised it's cohesive.
34. Agreed. Miles even said he'd rather an LNP government than form a minority with the Greens. Seems like they're shooting themselves in the foot in this regard when the Greens would be willing to pass all their progressive policies like affordable healthcare, abortion access and free lunches etc. But nah, can't have those far left commies in parliament hey
35. The ALP are mostly conservative, with a slight lean towards progressive. Think centrist, but on the progressive side if you really force it. The public is centre right, and the Libs are strongly right of centre. We can argue over whether one side dragged the other or pushed them there, but Labor isn't a force for change any more; they are what John Howard tried to claim the Libs were (anti-change stewards, trying to make things not break, rather than improving them or breaking them if it's worthy).
36. The reason we like Miles is because he went left to try and go after the Greens. Don't try and suggest we'd have 50c fares if the Greens didn't exist
37. >Labor will be elected to clean up the mess in another three years * 4 years
38. Mate, what? There is a youth crime crisis. The data that has come out supports an argument of less offences, but what it doesn’t show (and what rightly people are upset about) is the increase of severe crimes. It’s hard to argue that we have had so many repeat offenders over the past few years out on bail go on to carry out more serious offences and in a few cases, people have lost their lives. Also please explain yourself about a “license to kill people” or remove it. No one is interested in either side of politics in making life actively worse for people.
39. Every month, my Greens MP writes to me (and everyone) about how bad Labor is. It's a tad bit disingenuous to also blame them when they then implement 'good' policy.
40. The Greens logic is flawed. You're saying the ALP has to give up on communities that they already represent, just because the Greens want them? That's outrageous. If the Greens didn't want ALP to have to funnel resources into seats like McConnell and Cooper, they didn't have to declare them target seats and go after sitting members. No reason the Greens couldn't focus on the regions. They have no right to inner city seats just because they want them.
41. Are you joking? Labor had been in for over a DECADE, it was time for them to leave regardless if they told you they'd give you a million dollars personally, they were not winning this election. "If only they did x and y they'd be in" is nonsense when the political agenda of the LNP was openyl cartoonishly evil. The voters were heavily influenced by the media's demonisation of youth crime and its relevance. Fucking Greens voters insist on doing everything but reflecting on their failures as their own. Even in this instance of a major LNP win you're insinuating Labor caused the Green's demise? Do you actually hear yourself?
42. Doesn't the result show the opposite? They won 15 more seats than predicted thanks to Miles' progressive policies.
43. Stop watching TikToks of Max Chandler-Mather saying what you want to hear and start actually analysing and researching Labor policies because this reeks of a very absolutist, populist opinion that is fundamentally not true.
44. I was on the ground in Cooper all prepoll and election day and you've got it wrong, smear campaigns came from Greens. They need to stop targeting progressive women like Jonty Bush (and Terri Butler and Jackie Trad) and go after some conservative men for a change.
45. They did provide their own reasonable housing policy, and labours housing policy would have only helped 0.02% of first horm buyers. If the point of the independents is to keep the big parties in check how is demanding a reasonable housing bill an issue?
46. It’s been a Greens policy for a few years now
47. They've had free school lunches in the USA since 1946. Trump and Vance have promised to get rid of free school lunches because it's socialism. "The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (79 P.L. 396, 60 Stat. 230) is a 1946 United States federal law that created the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) to provide low-cost or free school lunch meals to qualified students through subsidies to schools."
48. The Greens face bigger challenges in the bush, because that's the place they most want to change, than in the cities. They're not a rural companion party.
49. >as far from the environment they wish to protect as is possible, ironically It is ironic but not an uncommon or surprising pattern. It's easy to hold an opinion, even a strong opinion, about something you're not exposed to or impacted by every day. The opinions are also more homogenous because they're informed by someone else's perspective instead of first hand experience. When you are exposed to the reality of such situations your perspective becomes much more ambivalent, pragmatic, and considered. People in inner city cohorts, especially university students - well educated, well off, and well isolated - often have strong opinions about animal rights, the environment, refugees, farming and mining practices, etc. Put them on a farm, a mine site, etc and watch them change with first hand experience.
50. Me too. I swing between Labor and the Greens (70:30 if I had to average) but between CFMEU backing and what felt like constant attempts to wade in on Palestine (regardless of where their support in that conflict lay, it's not relevant at a state level) I think they've lost me for life unless they really reign it in and oust the clowns.
51. Well, obviously you prioritise winnable seats (especially in a contest with no Senate race). That's just life in a representative democracy. To be fair, the ALP did a very good job of saving the furniture in what could have been a complete wipeout.
52. Yes but that's still a workable strategy for ALP under a preference based system. Provided LNP primaries start from a very low base LNP voters will preference ALP ahead of greens most of the time without there being a risk of LNP winning the seat
53. I don't know which side you mean, to be honest. The parties both criticise each other, as they should.
54. Both parties need to accept that they are opponents. There's this faux-outrage every time they oppose each other, and IMO it's not reasonable.
55. Terri Butler was a grub take it from me as a safe Labour voter. Problem is now greens are a party of gunnas and the public have seen that. Their inaction following through on their promises has led to their own demise.
56. But wasn’t it the Greens who came up with the free lunches first? Then Grace Grace who was Education Minister at the time laughed at the idea.
57. I already have a list for the next big meeting pre-fed election
58. Yup, this is why I still vote for them even though their actions don't impress me all the time. Gotta shift that Overton Window back to the left. I was incredibly happy with Miles and Labor over the last 8 months. It was a good balance IMO.
59. Arguable Labor going left while picking up Greens voters is costing them support on the other side to LNP. Greens are the loudest but numerically are only a small fraction of the voter-base.
60. But isn't the goal of the greens to be a pressure group that shifts policy left? Isn't Labor stealing their policies and moving left literally the goal?
61. What. This isn't true at all. Labor routinely and consistently has progressive policies and moreso has done a great job at slowly but surely turning the bullshit mining monopoly our state is into something profitable for all of us. The Greens bitch and moan about this all the time but fundamentally have not offered any meaningufl policies federally or state-wide. This shit is just more 'both major parties do x and y' which creates the immediate false equivalency that the two parties share major similarities, when realistically they're both just big government. One side utilises its professionals, anaylists and policy makers in relevant fields and the other party is creating policy purely for its donors and itself.
62. Doesn't that mean it will automatically correct by next election?
63. Actually mostly no, the removal of a conservative right wing premier (Palaszczuk) and installation of a left wing one (Miles) by the factions. Palasczuk was a true conservative- little change, softly softly, don’t frighten the horses. Miles is of the left (tho more from rank opportunism than belief) and of course his group were going to want to see change in direction. But I concede, yes, governing parties can and should steal good ideas from anywhere. That’s how you govern well and stay in office
64. The whole point of being a minority party is to try and use your influence to get your ideas adopted. It is *insane* for the greens to complain about it. If they're not in favour world their ideas being adopted by majority parties then they have literally no reason to exist. It's batshit.
65. Proposed but as the problem with greens is, details and implementation. They can provide the idea but ironing out the implementation at scale is better left to the bigger party. For example, cheap public transport. If the original greens plan was implemented we wouldn't have any data or visibility on which route to plan for expansion, which segments are needed to be more direct. Details and planning 2 steps ahead is their weakness.
66. Yes, Labor is factional. Right wing faction in control means more right wing policy. Miles is Labor Left. I think you’ll find that Labor Left have been fighting for these things for a long time. ‘Copying the Greens’ please, they don’t have a monopoly on social policy nor should they. You don’t want Labor to be right wing? Then join the party and bolster the ranks of Labor Left.
67. That's cool, maybe a Greens government can implement policies that the Greens want if they Greens want credit for it.
68. If all they're complaining about is not being seats instead of not having change, they can get fucked as they're no different anyway, which is exactly why they didn't get voted in. The Greens should be cheering Labor for being fashionably late and then should be making new policies pushing the overton window further, not complaining that they came up with a good idea and people recognised it was a good idea.
69. Thats because the 'right wing' of the labor faction are in the capital and used to run QLD. Legit the only 2 things that Stevan did was propose free school lunches and cutting transport fairs (though alot of the lost revenue was made up by the massive spike in usage), and people are using that to say Labor shifted massively left wing Miles does not support rent caps or rent freezes, or $18,000 tax cuts (thats a greens policy, look it up), Again none of these policys were stolen and the greens didnt even pressure labor to take the policy of 50 cent fares. The left wing of the party has ALWAYS had these policys in mind (my source is working for Meaghan Scanlon a while back)
70. The ideas weren’t original to the Greens though, nor were the Greens the only ones to advocate for them, so it’s either give credit to a very long list of individuals and groups, or be pragmatic and not bog the communications with that.
71. I think a realist. In my early 20s I 100% was a bleeding heart greenie. Call it as you said being a realist or maybe we are more cynical - but I'm tired of perfect being the enemy of progress when it comes to the greens and other lefties. If it's not 100% resolved within 3 months, then it's a cause not worth. Last year it was Ukraine, now it's isreal/Palestine. And as much as I support a ceasefire and getting isreal away from Palestine, we are living in Australia. We need to focus on Australian issues, and the greens while focusing on Housing are intense on the Gaza issue + getting a bit weird too. It just cause the cause seem disingenuous as it's just looks like they are going form disaster to disaster to get points off that
72. That's sort of my view of the Greens as well, they can come up with some great progressive policies, but they can also lose sight of reality as well. Most people on all sides of the political spectrum want affordable housing solutions, and cost of living relief policies, even recent LNP voters. Nobody ultimately cares who comes up with the idea. If the TV show The West Wing should have taught us all anything, it's that there is no reward in politics if it's done properly.
73. I vote greens and support a lot of their policies. They have always generally been batshit insane though. Just as you have the far right nutters like One Nation you have a lot of far left nutters in the Greens party. Many decent people who want good things but definitely a decent number of insane hypocritical people too.
