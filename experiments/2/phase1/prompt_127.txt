Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. I am very sorry to hear that you had suffered rape, you have my sincere sympathies. I have no issue with a morning after pill type treatment after such an instance. My impression is that is that they are part of a "rape kit" that hospitals have to treat and collect evidence after such a crime, however you would know better than me. I wish you well in your life.
2. I said if there was ever one near me I don’t really care about the ones not close to me or that are in dedicated areas those I have no problem with and think it’s good people can voice their opinion I mean the random ones which stem from these in public spaces blocking roads and streets
3. Yeah that’s the point not sure what else you expect out of it
4. Standard woman blaiming, clearly you cant understand a male *and* a female is required to make a baby, shocking i know. Also rape is a thing and failed birth control happens. Doesnt make a woman a mandatory incubator.
5. This is what I meant though, I wasn’t looking to bolster anti-abortion. I the 100% ‘pro-life’ position should be off the table. There should be an option for choice. If you take the 100% ‘pro-choice’ to the illogical extent then you could terminate at 9 months. Thats not what ppl want and so that’s obviously ridiculous and a bad argument against abortion rights. So there’ll always be a governed limit on ‘choice’. That’s where I don’t get the “my body my choice” counter argument, shouldn’t the discussion be how far the choice is allowed? Is the current 22 weeks enough? As I understand it there are still options after that with doctor approval. Do ppl want more choice or it to be left as is? Are there any valid arguments to tighten things, other than the religious angle…? I’ve not read into or care what Katter wants. You hit the nail on the head in the last bit. The discussion should be around not having ridiculously short timeframes and are requirements adequate or too burdensome.
6. Nothing like what I am saying. Crisafoolery is deliberately using his beliefs to affect Queenslanders rights.
7. Yeah I think that’s a good comparison. They are both nuts. Probably not the point you were trying to make.
8. 1. Babies are innocent humans 2. Ending the life of an innocent human is morally wrong 3. The ending of a innocent humans life is murder 4. Murder is morally wrong. There for: Abortion is murder and morally wrong.
9. This sexual emergencies are health care, if you don’t want to get roped just consent
10. Just becuse it’s a “medical decision” does not make it moral. Abortion is no more moral then the aztecs sacrificing their children to the sun god.
11. Happy, if you find out you’re pregnant early, and you do t have the capacity then make the decision early on. Don’t wait
12. They've restricted panadeine which was the only medication helped my sciatica I'm very responsible about taking meds. The doctor was more than happy to keep me on them but then the stupid government banned it. Prescription only now.
13. I believe this is all related to the opioid epidemic in the US? They are cracking down in Australia too even though Australia never had the same problems and never had doctors prescribing opioids with the same strength.
14. Exactly, I’ve suffered from frequent (weekly) awful skull-crushin, debilitating headaches and cluster migraines since inwas a teen. The ONLY thing that helps is if i take a couple of Nurofen+ when i feel the first signs of it, and nip it in the bud. Now it’s been taken off shelves and made prescription only, which means i have to now pay $100 to see and my awful dismissive GP who made me feel like a drug fiend, and literally told me “l’ll give you this one box, but no more after that”. Like buddy that’s not how chronic pain works! It’s literally the weakest opioid, you don’t get any sort of ‘buzz’ from taking them and by taking the ‘opioid hysteria’ straight from Murica (whose problem is with the STRONGEST shit like fentanyl & oxy! No one is dying from codeine ffs) they’re just making it harder for millions of ppl who suffer to get relief.
15. But if you want something for your horrendous pain they'll treat you like a drug addict
16. Since tools wanted to use the term "murder" as a form of propaganda
17. Since a human is conceived. We are an enlightened species ( albeit questionably so) i see terminating a baby as murder and something that scarrs the mother for life. How about men take more responsibility.
18. True and them not having the Labor party policy of being forced to vote with the party line or face being booted means there is wiggle room. Hypothetically given I would assume all KAP support the bill if introduced, and all Labor, Green, and Sandy Bolton oppose it. Thats 21 LNP members who would at least need to vote against the bill. Entirely possible, that’s all provided all members at present for the vote. Something which isn’t guaranteed either. So lots of unknowns except Robbie’s willingness to introduce the bill previously. He has made that clear. Numbers and my maths I’m working off could be wrong…as there assumed of where counting currently stands for the 10 undecided seats. LNP 53 Alp 34 Green 1 KAP 4 IND 1
19. Vast majority don’t support banning abortion. Even in the 2018, a lot of them voted against the legislation due to the 22 week limit. They wanted it lower at around 18 for abortion on demand. This was based on survivability. The youngest premature baby born was 21 weeks. In fact, under Frecklington, the policy was to review the 22 week limit. The estimates of the party room in this view (plus the 3 I believe that supported the legislation at the time) was around 35%. This was an LNP parliamentary team by the way that leaned further right than its current makeup post-election 2 elections. Had they won more seats (particularly in Brisbane), the majority of the party would have either voted down the 22 week limit changing or have had it change to something like 18 weeks. There was never going to be an abortion ban.
20. Why do we have to keep going over and over this? 1. No one is having a ‘Late Term’ abortion for shits and giggles. 2. No one is leaving a developed baby to die alone in a metal tray.
21. Site your sources because this sounds, smells and looks like a load of BS
22. This is absolute bullshit. The official guidance for this situation was posted and it is the complete opposite of what you are suggesting.
23. It’s about sending a message. Isn’t that the point of any protest? We’re watching and we’re paying attention.
24. Because if they push it, we want the guys with the seats to say no
25. Because ultimately it would be LNP that would actually vote it in assuming they would vote again as they have before. Some have also publicly indicated a ‘pro-life’ stance.
26. Because how the LNP votes will determine if it passes. If the LNP confidently says it would not pass, that would kill scare mongering like this cold dead. The scare mongering works because they refused to commit to that as part of their party policy. That leaves uncertainty, and when you look at how they would vote based on their personal beliefs, well, that would be for restricting abortion. I give it a 60% chance they go for a concious vote. 40% chance I am pleasantly surprised. Not sure where it is comming from, but there has been a lot more stiring up of this issue in several states, feels like some one is trying to strike up a divisive tone and in warry of that. I don't inherently dislike the LNP or Liberal party. I do wish they were less...kind of basket cases though. They could have easily won the last Victroian election, if they had put forth positive policy and ideas, instead of negative culture war and conspiracy theory bullshit they went with. When I worked there a few years ago, I had backers of the Liberal party there tell me unironically that they should be fighting the election on trans people.
27. Because KAP only has a handful of seats, they can't pass it without significant support from LNP members.
28. It feels like the LNP apologists are shifting the goal posts. "They won't touch abortion rights" -> "They're just touching *some* abortion rights".
29. I have read it, and also trust the views of our expert medical professionals on it >Whether intended or not, the bill will undoubtedly limit access to abortion services, discouraging practitioners from providing abortions due to fear of prosecution," RANZCOG said. If you actually read the study that KAP refer to, you will find the following: >The study said most terminations were performed because of medical issues with the baby, including structural malformations or genetic abnormalities. There are a number of rather horrific genetic anomalies that produce nightmarish deformations that are not compatible with life. The terminations in study were not undertaken on a whim, but were likely deeply traumatic for the mother, and required consultation and confirmation from multiple doctors. Katter wants to further traumatise the mother as well as the medical staff by forcing them to use IV drips and intensive care methods on nightmare fuel lumps of flesh that are going to die slowly and horribly. So now every one gets to suffer more because the Law gets to override the specific circumstances and ignore expert medical advice. Oh, and if they don't contribute to this horror parade the medical staff can face criminal charges. Colour me not fucking impressed.
30. I apologise for the vehemence in my last sentence, and should really go to sleep.
31. “It’s not part of our plan”, until all of a sudden it is. Promises mean jack shit. That’s the point.
32. >The LNP has been fairly and lawfully elected by a clear majority. Of fucking idiots.
33. So why did you vote for the lnp if not to restrict abortion rights? That's about the only thing they've actually come close to proposing
34. The argument being made here doesn’t make sense unless you assume the LNP was elected on the premise of criminalising abortion which they weren’t. It’s no secret in the Australian system that people make compromises on who they vote for and a grand majority of Queenslanders seemed opposed to the idea of criminalising abortion to the point that the LNP had to say multiple times they wouldn’t bring it forward. That at the very minimum seems to indicate that there is a fairly popular mandate to not recriminalise abortion Adding on to that, that would mean the LNP criminalising it (even if they do do via a conscious vote) would be going directly against the mandate of what they promised voters on the lead up to the election and against the democratic wishes of the public at large. I’m sure no one thinks just because a party is elected they have the right to do whatever policy they want. But let’s say we don’t know for sure what the public wants at large, well ironically legally protesting a specific policy is the main method given to the public when it comes to indicating opposition to a specific policy while not necessarily opposing the current government. So even if we do assume that we can assume nothing about pre-existing mandates against recriminalisation, making it publicly heard just how unpopular a policy it would be is quite literally the best way to challenge a particular policy while respecting the results of an election.
35. You know they can say "no" if they're approaching or in the ovulation window. What happened to self control & abstaining for a week or so? Apparently that's too much to ask & immediate gratification is valued more highly than a life.
36. my point was that the nuance you are arguing for people to take already exists in the pro choice camp, there is no pro choice extreme that actually exists and while there are differing agreements on points where abortion isnt the right path medically thats an internal argument that isnt really touched on by the argument of pro choice v anti abortion advocates. Being anti abortion is just what it is, while there are some variations of how anti abortion legislation forms, its generally either one of two ways, totally outlawing access to abortion or making access so prohibitively difficult that it amounts to the same thing. The debate that occurs in that regard is completely around how heavily they can restrict abortion access. While I understand what you are saying I dont thinks its valid to "both sides" this thing when the issue that is often discussed and the position that Katter and most of the LNP want to take is primarily that of an outdated extreme stance that serves only to harm women. The nuance you want is already fundamentally on one side of the debate, that being the pro choice side, it is not an idea that Katter and much of the LNP support
37. Don’t we vote for conviction in our leaders. Surely a man who has strong values has got to be good for the state.
38. Please show where a 1-20 week clump of cells can live independently of a host (that’s 5 months and not a candidate for abortion, baring life threatening abnormalities)? FYI 21 weeks is the earliest on record for it to survive. If it’s not able to live outside its host, it’s not a human life, it’s a clump of cellular potential, but it isn’t a baby.
39. Medicine and the law disagree with you. Get a doctor to explain it to you.
40. That could just be the most braindead take I think I’ve ever heard
41. That is almost always what happens. Late term abortions just because are exceedingly rare and there’s no point to your hypothetical because it just takes away from the situation.
42. You have a post history talking about getting off ketamine. Are you sure your doctor doesn’t have a right to be concerned?
43. It's not a solution of course, but you might have a better time if you change doctors. It's not codeine, by my doc gives me repeat prescriptions for medicine so I don't have to go back very often
44. Katter’s planning to reintroduce his failed bill from earlier this year, titled “Termination of Pregnancy (Live Births) Amendment Bill 2024”. According to [this](https://amp.abc.net.au/article/104502092) ABC article. You can read the previous bill [here](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/pdf/bill.first.exp/bill-2024-003)
45. Whats the message? People are aware of abortion and have their personal values. Awareness campaigns about shit people are already aware of is such virtue signalling rubbish. So what message is conveyed in the protest other than ‘my view is more important than your view’? And I am 1000% pro choice so save me that bullshit vector of attack.
46. >Because how the LNP votes will determine if it passes. If the LNP confidently says it would not pass, that would kill scare mongering like this cold dead. And killing the scare mongering is the easiest thing in the world at this point. "We will not vote for any bill by KAP about abortion". Instead they don't do that. And you have to ask "Why"?
47. how does a legal precedent set by the courts at a federal level in the us and not the legislature have anything to do with that?
48. The sort of mature & emotionally stable response we've seen repeated ad nauseam on this forum since last night. The epic seething is delicious.
49. There's more to voting than just abortion rights ffs 🙄
50. To ensure the state is properly governed. I quite frankly don’t care either way about abortion
51. Reproductive rights are a family issue and are not isolated to women. It affects fathers, siblings, and the unborn. Saying that men don’t have a say or aren’t affected is inaccurate and insulting (Also there are boomers in the ALP). That would be like saying women don’t get a say in men’s rights, which would be equally inaccurate and insulting. It’s just designed to further divide us Also, I’m not against abortion but I do think it needs to be regulated somewhat. Seeking an abortion in the third trimester just because you have decided you don’t want to be a mum anymore is just sad 😢, or having a carte Blanche abort whenever you like is not ideal. Have caveats such as medical reasons, pregnancy as a result of rape and so on. The abortion debate has become very emotive and been labelled as this “you’re either for it all the way to birth or against it completely - either banned or not”. It is more complex than that. I recommend anyone see a little baby inside a womb during the second trimester and ask themselves if they would be happy to terminate their little life. Anyway I’m happy to have a discussion about it - conversations are better than violence
52. I was born at 29 weeks. At the time I was given a small chance to survive. The doctors gave me a blood transfusion without even asking my parents. I spent over 3 months in hospital. Nowadays babies are surviving at 21-24 weeks. If technology keeps improving and we are able to save even younger premature babies outside of the womb, does this affect the age you consider it "a human"?
53. A 20 week old foetus is more than a clump of cells. It looks very much like a human baby. They look like a human from 12-14 weeks. A clump of cells would be called an embryo. From 9 weeks onwards they are a foetus.
54. Well news flash everyone on earth are clumps of cells. We’re still human. The second the the sperm cell touches the egg it becomes a human. Just because it can’t survive outside the mother does not mean it’s not a human being. The ability to survive without life support does not define a human being.
55. Just because the law disagrees with me does not make it morally right. Most immoral things throughout history were once reinforced by law.
56. Not really. Abortion is sacrifice upon the alter of selfishness.
57. What if the man wants it but the woman doesn’t?
58. So we then get stuck on morality. As blokes our only control mechanisms are the costs out weigh the pleasure. I don’t know why the government doesn’t run advertising campaigns advising young men that if you get a girl pregnant you will be paying for 18 years for that child. Sometimes advertising does help.
59. According to a statement from RANZCOG in that same article “Practitioners have an existing duty of care to all their patients, including babies born alive, whether this happens following an abortion or otherwise.” As RANZCOG stated, there’s no point of introducing this bill when practioners are already mandated to care for a baby in this (extremely rare) circumstance. If a practitioner doesn’t follow this and leaves them “on a cold metal try in pain until they die” they are risking their entire livelihood. Would they do that? I don’t think so. Ultimately, this bill won’t add anything other than fear. Fear that practitioners are putting themselves at risk to perform necessary medical procedures (that are often needed to cases where the fetus is incompatible with life anyways!).
60. Is Labor out of touch with the working class? No, the workers are all idiots and hicks! They don’t know what’s good for them! - average Labor stooge logic. The loss It’s everyone’s fault but the labor parties. God forbid they critically examine their own parties failures.
61. It might not be a big issue to you, but to the women forced to birth humans they do not want and are not prepared for, it is.
62. So you voted for them so the state is properly governed but the LNP spent more time dodging questions about abortion than they did actually talking about their plans for the state
63. I ate a hotdog, then took a shit, that looked like a sausage. By your logic, it's still a hotdog. Also if its called a fetus, it's not called a baby, because it isn't one.
64. > The ability to survive without life support does not define a human being. So by that logic, switching off someone's life support after medical consultation and consent of next of kin is also murder?
65. That’s the point. No one wants babies to be left to die in the circumstances the other commenter described. So theoretically if you wanted to make a bill that limits abortion without explicitly coming out and saying it. It would be really easy to try and limit practitioners willingness to perform abortions over something that RANZCOG has already said that practitioners must be doing (that is, caring for a baby in these circumstances). If an abortion is successful late term, what’s stopping someone from saying “you left that baby to die” and then punishing those who performed the abortion? Please take a look at RANZCOG’s statement in the full article from the ABC ❤️
66. its not a metaphor at all, and it couldnt happen here because abortion isnt federally legal by legislation or supreme court edict. its a really shallow and baseless tale and shows a very immature and shallow understanding of australia and also the us legal issue you referenced
67. Yeah the LNP are famously in touch with the workers.
68. I’m happy with the outcome and my vote, I don’t need commentary from the left
69. I care about women, but I’m also entitled to my view which is impartial.
70. I am unsure if you have the maturity level to be discussing and deciding on such complex issues. If born beyond 20 weeks of gestation it is classed as a human baby. P.S. If you took a shit, it would half your intellect hey Shit For Brains?
71. abortion is very different than taking someone off life support. And the main difference, in my opinion, is the cause of death. So let me try to explain this. The definition of abortion is the intentional killing of an unborn human being. Now, taking someone off life support can be done for many reasons. Let’s just take one type of scenario when the person has suffered a serious medical condition like heart attack, or a stroke, or had a serious brain injury or something like that. They are now terminal or even perhaps brain-dead, but they’re on life support, meaning their body is being kept alive by machines, and no further medical treatment will provide a reasonable hope of benefit. Now, if a doctor takes a person off life support in that case, their body will die. The cause of death in that case, however, is not brought about by the doctor, but rather the disease or the injury that put the person in the grave medical condition they were in. So in both abortion and in taking someone off life support, the end result is the same. You have a dead body. But the critical difference is that in abortion you intend to kill the person and are the cause of death.
72. True so what is the answer. No one wants more intrusion in our lives by big brother government. We have enough rules however An app available to men and women that the other party signs on their phone something like: Intimacy agreement I agree I’m using contraception I will wear condom If I get pregnant I take full responsibility for the child and associated cost. I understand if I get pregnant that it is illegal to get an abortion unless prescribed by a doctor that mother’s health is at risk or baby’s quality of life is at risk. Re deformities etc Man guarantees he will respect no is know and girl signs to say she wants to have sex . There is obviously a way of simplifying this however it certainly leaves young people quite aware of there obligations.
73. You’re an idiot. SCOTUS judges claim they won’t change anything about abortion, then proceed to do so. Crisafulli claims he won’t change anything related to abortion but I can guarantee if the opportunity comes up, he’ll try to. That’s the comparison I’m making - that promises or claims mean nothing. Nothing to do with judicial systems or court decisions or anything. Can I make it any clearer?
74. Who’s talking about the LNP? I’m talking about labors biggest voting base which has resoundingly voted them out this election
75. I'd pity any women you know but I'd be surprised if you know any
76. Pretty much all anti-abortion rhetoric comes from the religious part of society, which by way of its existence, shows a lack of maturity and intellect. Smart people operate from facts, dumb people operate from emotion. Which is why you, implying a fetus born at 20 weeks, is a baby, despite the fact it will 100% die. As no baby has survived being born at 20 weeks, because it's not a fully formed. Hence not a full baby. Like my shit wasn't a full hotdog.
