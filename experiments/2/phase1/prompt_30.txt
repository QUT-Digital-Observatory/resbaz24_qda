Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. The sad thing is, Australia is probably the best country for Asian people in the Anglosphere due to proximity and Asian people being the largest minority group. I cant imagine being in America and also having to go through the social struggles of interacting with other minority groups like Hispanics, and black Americans. But yes, as an ethnic minority I want to leave Australia when I finish my degree. This country has no ambition or hard-workers, with terrible public transport. I literally can't overstate how bad this shitty bus system is. This country is full of white bogans living in their privileged secluded bubble, I don't see a future here, especially when surrounded in a workplace by only white people in a corporate workplace. Actual living hell. What is Australian culture exactly? It sure isn't the amazing food, or the smart people, or the amazing manmade tourist destinations, all of which are nonexistent. This place has no culture, since the white colonizers plundered the land due to their greed. Australian culture is commonly described as laidback, chill, welcoming, all of which are false. At this point, Australia is just a watered down version of the USA. It's an embarassing culture, with no originality or respect, and blatant racism towards the Aboriginals. Like let's be honest, what culture have Australians built here? Literally nothing. The most boring culture on Earth definitely. Australia loves to rag on New Zealand but they incorporate the Maori far better than whatever Australia has. No ambition, no work-ethic, no nothing, just a.false sense of pride and superiority. White people here love to rag on the Aboriginals, despite them being the colonziers, immigrants and newcomers. The humour here is also trash. Just being snarky and thinking they're all funny, when it's just sad and pathetic. The only thing good about this country is the amazing nature, which the people did not build or create. Not gonna give you points there. Especially Brisbane, this place actually sucks so much. I can't believe this city was chosen for the Olympics, 😂 😂 😂, the entire world will laugh at this city and for good reason. Can't even get a fucking bus to arrive on time or even within 15 minutes, but think they can host the Olympics 😂 😂, it's so funny and sad. I feel sorry for you Australians. People are gonna downvote me, but I'm right. Or I'm gonna get a snarky reply that is "sooo funny and original". But they're just salty because they think Australia is some kind of amazing unique country with a great culture. It's none of those things. This place actually is terrible.
2. I was thinking the same. Not an environmental party any longer.
3. Ah yes, the one I swear is moderated by Rita the angry Chihuahua and Andrew Dolt
4. this sub isn’t much better tbh, the downvotes are proof of that
5. Informal votes are kinda stupid. Elections don't come around that often, at least put in the minimal amount of effort to learn about our political process and participate in it properly. Informal voting is lazy and entitled. If you informally vote, you shouldn't be complaining or talking about really anything that happens due to political forces because you chose not to participate in the process of influencing it.
6. In what ways do One Nation help single disenfranchised dads? Last I saw all they care about is muslims
7. I love how all these muppets call the greens marxists but they have no clue about what marxism is. The greens are so fucking far from marxist it's insane. They're ideologically opposed to gun ownership for a start. Marxism isn't. 'marxist' is just a buzzword used by idiots to describe anything they don't like but can't explain why they don't like it
8. Yes, dumbass, environmentalists tend to be leftists. How is that at all suprising lmao
9. Let me get this straight - non renewable energy which is pretty damn difficult to convert to electricity and, you know, not renewable, will lead to more expensive living than panels creating power from the sun? In the sunshine state...? I mean maybe in the very very short term, but any kind of long term view? Solar + EV = gone from $400/month on fuel to $50/month on charging when I need a top-up in a hurry
10. Lol, family court issues are federal issues. If you voted One Nation in a state election for that, you're a racist and a moron. Seriously have to be brain dead to vote One Nation.
11. Foreign investment is already regulated though? Only approved foreign buyers can buy property here
12. r/thatHappened Also "mom" gives you away as someone who probably doesn't live in Australia.
13. And you think that voting One Nation in a state election for a middle power stops world wars...how?
14. You two being all witty really sticks in my craw
15. You using the expression ‘crushes my tomatoes’ really chokes my chicken.
16. Conversely, I was going to suggest it fluffs my buttons.
17. This was backlash on the Borbidge Nationals over the compulsory Gun Buybacks wasn’t it?
18. Hating gay kids is a pretty big vote winner in a lot of immigrant communities.
19. Legit I live in a suburb full of immigrants and there were soooo many LNP yard signs around... Like besties they hate you and want you deported 😭
20. Maybe they realised they're in a crowded housing market and more immigration *also* hurts them? Not that hard to understand
21. I'm pretty sure people who vote that are immigrants can speak English 🤓
22. How does this happen? Aren't there minimum English requirements to become a citizen?
23. Nothing is coming up under google search for that, do you have a link?
24. 100% Always was and always will be about the grift.
25. As if it's any different for any of the other politicians? It's the only reason any of them do it 🤣
26. A bit ludicrous and personally didn't agree but not an election breaker.
27. You mean the bills that would have made it more expensive to buy a house? We need policies that actually address the issues instead of giving handouts to companies that only build luxury apartments. If we want to actually do something about the housing crisis, then we need to actually do something that will increase the amount of affordable housing
28. I lived in the UK for 3 years and that wasn't my experience
29. Hey, I am Indian origin and live in Brisbane. I moved up here from Melbourne and expected some racism. To my relief, nothing like that has happened. My white Aussie neighbours are welcoming and speak nicely. The local tradies that I contracted were very nicely behaved. Everyone at work, including born and bought up Brisbane old timers and younger ones do not go after me in any way. Even the qld public service that I interact with are respectful. Yes someday some rando in train will not doubt shout at me and I will chalk it up as exception. So please do not talk Brisbane down. Bus punctuality is an occasional issue I admit.
30. You sound racist as hell. If you hate white people that's not their fault.
31. You've obviously not had good experiences in Brisbane. Sorry it hasn't been welcoming. There's no sense being miserable and getting angrier and angrier by staying here. Why not transfer to somewhere else in Australia or elsewhere where you can be happy? Somewhere that's more in line with what you're looking for? I've travelled and lived in many countries and no country or place is perfect, there's always pros and cons that either suit you or don't. If you're looking for culture, Brisbane is not the place for you. You should have done a bit of research about Brisbane first and you wouldn't be so surprised when we have mullets and no shoes here mate. That's not why anyone would come to Brisbane, it's a big country town. People will downvote you because you're being snarky and making ridiculous sweeping statements about how everyone is a certain way, which obviously isn't possible, and it's the very thing you're deriding all Australians for being.
32. "If you don't like it you can leave" actually applies here. Australia is a safe, beautiful country with endless natural sites to explore, high-quality food (of all different kinds), and friendly people. Is it perfect? No. But it doesn't need your negativity, which helps nothing and no one.
33. Take a chill pill. As an minority living here, i didn't faced racism here in Brisbane. Maybe beacuse i live in the city and outside in the rural areas there's more chances to face it. The racism situation is very similar to Canada, in the city people are are open and progressive,outside in the rural there's a bunch of rednecks/bogans.But it's getting better everywhere now. I feel sorry for your small brain to not understand how public transportation works and not being happy in one of the nicest cities in the world, just gtfo and let people live their life.
34. With all due respect, millions of people pay significant sums of money to migrate here and live among "white bogans".
35. Still far more focused on environmental issues than any other party though...
36. Yeah the radical extremists we have in this country really take offence when you call out their sub (r/Australian)
37. I’m not sure they actually help them, but they are pretending to listen and forwarding proposals to change the family law court’s bias against them. Contentious issue I get that, but dismissing it is how one nation has grown to its current most popular state, imo.
38. Marxism accurately describes the political views of the leader of the Greens. Perhaps you should go and read up about your leader. Now, would he be the only one in the Greens with those views, or would he be in the leadership position because he best exemplifies the views of his party?
39. So just ignore all the stuff inside the solar panels as renewable?
40. reading this guys comments he doesn’t seem remotely educated at all lol
41. The woke agenda of the left is unacceptable to me. I have never seen colours and never been racist - well, the left agenda managed to bring the worst out of me (just being honest)
42. I grew up outside of Australia. It's almost like this country was built off immigration I interchange between mom and mum. But some evidence. Happened in Logan. Mom was wearing a tie dye shirt. Daughter had converse, black jeans and a baseball jacket. Sometimes, the improbable is true.
43. OP mentioned the environment.... where did I mention about voting for One Nation?
44. You using the expression 'chokes my chicken' really rumples my stiltkin.
45. Not Queensland, but I remember reading that an area of Sydney with a large Maltese population being mad at the Labor MP for voting for gay marriage.
46. You can't deport someone who can vote. They are a citizen
47. Every western democracy is in a crowded housing market. It is a global issue not a state issue and the ‘solutions’ put forth by the LNP will exacerbate the problem not solve it. It is hard to understand because usually personal experience is the easiest way for people to understand and not fall for the lies of liberal policy.
48. You would be surprised then. There are plenty of places that operate on getting people visas/citizenship in the same way licensing firms work, they give you the answers and walk you through the tests to make sure you pass.
49. Sure, but the same as any license there are places you can go to that just give you the answers if you have the money to pay for it.
50. [Here](https://www.onenation.org.au/sex-discrimination-bill-2024)'s the statement. Thankfully, looks like [it got thrown out](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard/Hansard_Display?bid=chamber/hansards/28051/&sid=0008)?
51. I lived there for 8. Yes they are. I'm white and speak english 1st langsuge, but was told to "fuck off back to wherever". I was born with a British passport. Multiple times I have had to rescue Indians and Africans from mobs of cavs. The Welsh are worse than the English. Further North you go, the worse it gets.
52. That’s how right wing populism always works. Pretend to listen and provide easy solutions to complex issues, like stopping immigration and blaming minority groups, to attract disenfranchised men who just want someone to blame other than themselves. It’s the exact same strategy the Nazi party used. It’s not that left wing parties dismiss men’s struggles, they’re the only ones with tangible systemic solutions that aren’t just blaming it all on everyone else. But the right wing parties embrace fear-mongering and lying to get these men on their side.
53. most pv cells are made of coated silicon, one of the most abundant elements around (second after oxygen i think). there is more glass used to protect the cells than used to create the panel itself, meaning when a panel is swapped out every 25-30 years, a majority of that glass stays right where it is. the biggest *real* issue with solar/wind is enough energy storage to shift off-peak production to peak demand, with chemical batteries being very very expensive right now and hydro batteries being reliant on geography. Either way, renewables require an initial investment the same way coal and gas did when they were first used to power the grid. Only this time, that investment lasts longer than coal ever could and you dont need to pay for the unnecessary labour required to burn a million+ tons of the stuff every year per plant.
54. Solar panels last 20-30 years; petrol lasts for the second it burns. Recycling the components at the end of their lifetimes is a huge focus for the renewable energy sector. The power from my solar panels doesn't need to get dug out of the ground, trucked around, and burned. It goes from my roof to my car. But we're not really going to pretend that you're against renewables because they aren't environmentally friendly *enough*, are we?
55. 'woke agenda' lmaoooooo what does that even mean in this context? please give actual examples of 'the left' and their 'woke agenda'
56. Ah now that you’ve listed what they were wearing there’s no way you’re lying. Thanks for confirming.
57. I can’t see how liberal make it worse labor actively opened the doors to hundreds of thousands and crushed our rental market
58. As far as I am concerned they do not give you citizenship unless you have a good job and are qualified. They only give you a visa where you have to find the job yourself. My parents are Indian and obtained Aussie citizenship by going back to school and getting jobs that are reputable and are actually facing a shortage in Australia i.e healthcare. And the people who did obtain some form of citizenship this way are illegal and should be deported. It must be some sort of forgery.
59. Fair enough. Although whether the Brits are worse than us or not, it's still a problem here.
60. Agreed, I’m not pushing to promote what theyr doing, but I think the picture is far more complex now then assuming they only attract racist supporters. There’s a reason they continue to win more seats every election, but idk, maybe that’s just reactionary to those arguments about the left pushing too far (I’m sure u know the one, I don’t care to entertain it, I’m an openly gay man and pushing an agenda on kids is in no ally’s interest, and can only think it’s genuinely the influence of Russian bots spouting seeds of division).
61. The very environmentally friendly chemicals that are forever abundant? We’re going to have a problem with the toxic batteries that’ll make asbestos look like a baby in the near future. And also look into actually how much and who owns the key components of batteries. There isn’t enough friendly toxic chemicals to last a few decades - and the owners will be able to increase the prices dramatically
62. I don’t think you understand how much energy it takes to make glass. And the massive amounts of concrete and steel in a base of a wind turbine. They will never be recycled- ever. If you cared about using less energy, you’d realise that 70% of the energy is lost in transmission. Construction is less than 8% of energy usage. If you made the massive building landlords change the leasing rules to increase air conditioning temperatures by 1 degree in commercial buildings, you’d save way more than all renewable efforts. When people feel so strongly about things that have such little impact, you play with the fringe without tackling the bigger problem. Exactly what the coal companies want
63. The left is woke, pro union and a group of losers re foreign policy, immigration etc. - and I doubt people really care about whether an individual in red is the same or different (I don’t)
64. Jeans and a baseball jacket in that heat? Yeah sure hahaha
65. Your plugger wouldn’t be bust if you didn’t clench so hard.
66. Immigration didn’t crush the rental market, that is a scapegoat. The population would be within 10% with or without the immigration policies. What crushed the rental market is a lack of government housing to provide a floor for rent and negative gearing skewing the investment market. No developer is going to increase supply in a constrained market enough to lower their returns or waste realestate on providing lower cost housing when they could sell them at higher rates to investors
67. It isn't forgery, it is playing exactly by the written rules and wholesale ignoring the spirit. The rules say you have to pass an english test so they teach exactly to the test the same as in every other industry. The reputable places who fail their students go out of business because the dodgy ones have 100% pass rates so everyone goes to them.
68. I don’t think every One Nation supporter is a racist, but they have all decided to support a racist party with racist leaders, which I would argue makes them racist, even if they aren’t actively personally racist. But I do get what you’re saying. It’s all based on material conditions. And yes the bots too.
69. > look into actually how much and who owns the key components of batteries i don't really understand what you're getting at here, but chemical batteries are not the only form of battery storage, they just happen to be the easiest to implement directly into the grid. Li-ion/LiFePo4 batteries are also not the only chemical batteries out there, hydrogen fuel cell technology is already powering translink busses and electrolysis is the perfect thing for dumping a bunch of useless off-peak generation for later use. We have several very viable and proven technologies at our disposal here, we'd be stupid to waste something as free and limitless as the sun.
70. People do. Not everything revolves around you. Unions do a lot of good unless you're an abusive employer.
71. 'Plugger' is a slang term for thong or flip flop in Australia ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|smile)
72. Which is exactly why we should reduce immigration, so that people don't come to this country unqualified. Coming to a foreign country with dodgy results isn't illegal? For you to obtain a job, it requires a working level of English. Your argument about the people faking IELTS is correct, but they are mainly students who do it to study abroad. Not people with degrees who are educated. Most Indians who have obtain citizenship are educated and know the voting system mate and I can assure that they vote conservative on purpose. However, I can't speak for all immigrants
73. Unions were relevant in the early of child labour etc. Not anymore They do nothing other than maintaining the Australian national sport of mediocrity through unnecessary protections I understand why you find them important - there are almost 300 million Indonesians living next door who would be happy to do your job for $100 per day. That’s the value of your time and skills - if you make more than that through being protected by the unions then I understand that you’re truly grateful. … but you’re not competitive at the global level
74. I think you misunderstand. These businesses are in Australia working with people who already have visas and are working on permanent residence status or citizenship. In theory they are a good thing as they cater to people working on obtaining citizenship/permanent residence but in practice they are a rort just like all of the other outsourced government programs. Australia runs on immigrant labour and immigrant scapegoating. Without immigrants to do service and production work and to be the enemy in political discussions the true state of the economy would be exposed and collapse.
75. My friend voted LNP because their MP is actually well known in the region and has advocated multiple times in parliament based on letters and correspondence sent in by individuals and business in the electorate. Meanwhile the Labor candidate was just some random person without much of a track record of anything. Not hard to see which is a more convincing proposition I guess. In the 2022 Federal Election, someone in the community who was well known ran as a progressive independent and almost took the seat from the LNP so it’s not like the seat is staunchly pro-LNP.
76. Apparently a friend I spoke to last night voted LNP because he 'hates mining companies"...
77. I asked my 4 family members who all voted LNP and here are their reasons: 1. Youth Crime & Labour had been in too long 2. Has always voted LNP at every level because their parents have always done that 3. Just picked the one that looked the cutest/coolest 4. Didn't know anything about any of the parties (it was their first election)
78. “Steven miles had a smug face during Covid” Stupid hurts sometimes
79. Sister who works in government in HR hated dealing with union shit all the time. She also has 2 daughters....
80. A nurse i know voted lnp because it's Labors fault the interest rates went up. I tried to argue the point and that this is a state election but no joy. Looking forward to fighting hard for our next EB agreement and striking next year.
81. [Didn't think I was going to get another use out of this so soon.](https://giphy.com/embed/12ETcAyWE6TjHy)
82. Asked mum what she was hoping for from an LNP government. Answer; increased public housing build by state government and a freeze on council rates and insurance costs. So yeah, let’s just leave it there.
83. A lot of my family are rusted on lib supporters. Some just wanted something different. Few of them will see any benefit I’m sure, as my nan said “why vote conservative if you’ve got nothing to conserve”
84. How about the Olympics??? … surely there’s ALP voters who were absolutely embarrassed at the idea that we weren’t getting a legacy stadium build for lions/cricket but QSAC was getting a 1.4 million temporary renovation. We might still have a dud Olympics but least it won’t be at Mt Gravatt
85. I'm actually worried about my job, I'm on a contract and work for P.A Hospital... Apparently last time lnp got elected they got rid of a lot of Qld Gov workers in the hospital...
86. Dead ass the parents of a kid at my son's school voted LNP because: Labour are getting rid of bulk billing, they want to charge $250 for a doctor's appointment. Another voted for one nation because: She just says what we are all thinking.
87. I have one cousin who apparently didn't like Steven Miles' 'vibe'. True story.
88. A friend voted LNP because he’s in the ADF, that is all
89. I didnt vote for them, but the new sex offender registery is a good idea. I think they're going to name it Daniel's law after Daniel Morcombe
90. -Apparently 50c train fares are misappropriation of funds and we should stop that. How dare the elderly and low income people (checks notes) go places. - something unintelligible about Ukraine inaudible muttering about Russia, mumble rumble, hezbollah needing to be shown what’s what and other incoherent babble. -Disney brainwashing children into being trans -the state school system being complicit in said transing of the youths -a woman should never have been made police commissioner for reasons -institutional misogyny doesn’t exist. Men and women are inherently different and just suited to different things. For example men are just better at being leaders and running countries and companies. Because statistically throughout history it’s been men and not women doing the leadership stuff. Check mate drop mic. -institutional racism doesn’t exist and anyone who is trying to say it does is just trying to blame me personally for colonisation -forced vaccinations and how everyone has compromised immune systems now that has nothing to do with contracting a virus that causes autoimmune disruption multiple times and everything to do with having to wear masks. (Actual conversations with conservative family members And no I don’t know how labor/greens etc are responsible for any of this stuff.)
91. Might finally get that new primary school on the west side. Might get disabled abscess to Taringa station Might Address over crowding at state high schools Might get a public transport option on the centenary highway Might get cooperation between the BCC and the state government for once Might get a decent Olympic plan Might get none of that 🤷🏻‍♀️
