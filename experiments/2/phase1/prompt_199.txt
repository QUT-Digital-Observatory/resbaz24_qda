Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. I‚Äôm really sorry. I‚Äôm not even from Queensland and it makes me feel the same. All you can do is get involved, talk to people, try and get them engaged in what‚Äôs going on and look beyond media spin.
2. I have already voted againt this discriminitory policy and the dominators who back it.
3. I guess we'll have to agree to disagree, you seem like a very caring person though.
4. Seriously can someone inform me what lnp have done/said regarding women‚Äôs rights? All I can find (I admit it‚Äôs sad) is cropped Tik toks by Steven miles.
5. I think it‚Äôs been an attempt at dragging a party through the mud. Personally I don‚Äôt believe you have anything to worry about. But if it does seem to go that way, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be one of many man protesting against it.
6. I worked in hospital obstetric units and I witnessed women who had to make terrible decisions when it was discovered the baby they were carrying had deformities or a medical condition that would make its life a misery if it survived at all. These women and their partners go through real anguish. They need the help and support of their medical advisors and the government needs to keep its nose out of this. I've witnessed doctors crying when they have a still-birth, they are trying to do the best thing for these women and their partners and the child but sometimes terrible decisions have to be made. I asked a friend who has turned anti-abortion and she said well women who have casual sex are at fault and that's what this is really about - punishing and controlling women. No way do I want this happening in Australia.
7. As someone who migrated from the US to escape all that B.S. I am very disappointed that it is being imported more and more by the local right. When my wife and I voted on Thursday we refused the LNP how to vote papers telling the LNP volunteers in no uncertain terms that we would not consider voting for LNP given their overall track record and stance on the right for women to choose.
8. I voted Labor for the first time ever, purely because what they‚Äôve done to help with cost of living and women‚Äôs reproductive rights. All the LNP seems to be focused on is crime which is all good and well, but you‚Äôre not gonna reduce crime unless you address the underlying issues which is what Labor seems to be focusing on.
9. Oh no, you will have to take accountability for getting pregnant! How terrible! Abortion rights are usually such a non-issue it's ridiculous. And PS this is not even the case. Abortion rights are still in your hands and will likely never change in Australia due to the degenerate left underbelly. You can choose to be a total hoe and killing your future children if you want to continue doing so. Let it reign heavy upon your subconscious for what you could have had if you were not such a terrible person.
10. The last thing I needed was to look at your comment history. But glad to know you ran out of ideas so had to go searching for SOMETHING. Firstly, your attitude and bias towards a political ideal gives me enough to know that you're a bottom feeder. Secondly, I have no interest in anything you say - I am simply enjoying the fact that something which will have little or no affect on most QLDer's lives will haunt you for the entire time the LNP are in office, which will be many, many years ahead! Enjoy your tuna bake! We're having rib eye on the bone ü•© with sauteed vegetables and will wash it down with a glass of 2015 Penfolds Shiraz üç∑, as we are still in celebratory mode after the election result.
11. Go out there and change people's minds and votes. You can sit at home being worri d or do something about it.
12. Is it actually on the ballot? I have yet to have anyone point me to a policy they want to implement. It‚Äôs all just guesswork
13. Welcome to gutter journalism. See who‚Äôs controlling the narrative now?
14. As a woman who has had terminations & is very pro choice and i now have 2 daughters...i am not the slightest bit concerned.
15. I swear this topic is just American politics / anti trump sentiment infiltrating Nothing going to happen to your abortions.
16. Try not to worry about it until after we see the results
17. The problem is that it is another life you want to terminate
18. Stop watching the US and have a chat with anyone on here, or most Australians in general. Regardless of anyone's personal views on abortion, it is undeniable that the overwhelming majority of Australians strongly support a women's right to choose and are prepared to throw in their support behind that from conception all the way up until birth. Even Crisafulli has come out and said he supports the right to choose - you will NEVER hear the equivalent from US conservatives. Never, or not for many many decades at least. Please, this is not the US; the more we worry about it becoming that way, ironically, the more like the US it becomes.
19. It may be a focal point but the reality is of the 2 major parties - the law won‚Äôt change on abortion.
20. I see you have fallen victim to the scare campaign.
21. Relax. Nothing is going to happen to women's rights. The whole thing truly is nonsense. Bloody Robbie Katter just fired off to shit stir cause he was pissed off at LNP for saying they did not want to form govt with KAP. The LNP have NEVER said they have any intention of changing abortion / VAD laws. Now even Robbie / KAP have backed off. It's just not going to happen. The ALP OF COURSE! Ran with it cause they NEED to stir up panic. Please don't buy into the hysteria. It truly is just utter nonsense.
22. No one actually believes this will happen, right? There was zero mention of changes to reproductive rights until Labor brought it up. Playing on people‚Äôs emotions like this is grubby stuff from a desperate ALP.
23. " How the fuck did we get here?" We are a Democracy . That is how we got here . In a Democracy you should respect the rights of others to hold views which are not aligned with your own. doesn't matter if they are Male / Female / Non Binary / Millenial / Boomer / GenZ Everyone of legal age has a say in legislation that affects the country . That is how it works . Maybe we should only let Drug users vote on substance legislation or Car Drivers have a say in legislation regarding speed limits . Or even more silly , perhaps only Criminals should have a say in any issue related to crime . Abortion is a societal issue and in a Democracy everyone has an input. What is REALLY worrying is extremist views of people who want to restrict Democracy. People to whom important issues like Abortion are either black or white . Either you are PRO abortion at any time for any reason or you want it banned . I think most Australians would support Abortion but NOT Abortion at any time for any reason.
24. The Queensland election has nothing to do with women‚Äôs reproductive rights. Australia isn‚Äôt the US. Don‚Äôt spread gossip.
25. look you got nothing to fear about, the LNP will not be criminalizing abortion, the ALP just been running a fear campaign because they are struggling to gain ground, the LNP have repeated stated that abortion laws will not change, KAP throwing out what they did was just to cause a stir, I would be more concern with the Self-ID bill that labor/green passed that erased your biological sex rights.
26. Even as someone voting the LNP last, I don't really think there's much to worry about on the abortion issue. It's really easy to get caught up in it, but I really don't think they'd change.
27. I wonder where all these people were when Labor was and still are because of their health cutbacks forcing women to have babies on the side of roads. Funny they were not out protesting about women's reproductive rights then and now. They seemed to not give a shit about women at all.
28. Well the paper yesterday should make you feel less anxious. In south Australia it wqs the labor party driving this exact same issue so its not party political. Aldo, we have to balance all arguments with the rights of the baby which is where the argument actually is with late term abortion. Ie women's rights AND baby's rights. It shouldn't be politicized but it is. Peace.
29. I wouldn‚Äôt vote for LNP, but reproductive rights are a family issue and are not isolated to women. It affects fathers and siblings. Saying that men don‚Äôt have a say or aren‚Äôt affected is inaccurate and insulting (Also there are boomers in the ALP). That would be like saying women don‚Äôt get a say in men‚Äôs rights, which would be equally inaccurate and insulting. It‚Äôs just designed to further divide us Also, I‚Äôm not against abortion but I do think it needs to be regulated somewhat. Seeking an abortion in the third trimester just because you have decided you don‚Äôt want to be a mum anymore is just sad üò¢, or having a carte Blanche abort whenever you like is not ideal. Have caveats such as medical reasons, pregnancy as a result of rape and so on. The abortion debate has become very emotive and been labelled as this ‚Äúyou‚Äôre either for it all the way to birth or against it completely‚Äù. It is more complex than that. I recommend anyone see a little baby inside a womb during the second trimester and ask themselves if they would be happy to terminate their little life
30. I‚Äôm not 100% certain on every individual member of the LNP & their beliefs. But please keep in mind that there is a lot of misinformation & fear tactics being implemented by the Labor Party in a desperate attempt to swing votes in their favour‚Ä¶ Firstly KAP isn‚Äôt introducing a bill to ban abortion, they are introducing a bill to amend current legislation to allow medical treatment/care to FAILED late term abortions (developed babies born alive); currently, if a developed baby is born alive due to a failed late term abortion, they are left on a metal tray, cold, in pain & crying until they slowly eventually die. QLD alongside VIC currently have the weakest abortion laws in Australia, as there are many minor flaws in the legislation, the pro-life community are outraged and as a result, Bob Katter (KAP) has pledged to amend the legislation inline with basic moral beliefs. Many members in conservative parties within QLD have accepted the fact that completely banning abortion is now off the table, but still strive to make adjustments to the current laws, this includes members of the LNP. Now please keep in mind that I am pro-choice & not a supporter of the LNP, however, because I am a normal human being with empathy, I believe that the current situation regarding ‚Äòfailed late term abortions‚Äô is inhumane, so do other Australian states where abortion is legal but have made it law to provide medical treatment to babies born in that situation. Food for thought‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt believe political advertising, do your own research & make an informed judgement.
31. I feel your pain but labor supporters prefer that we keep talking about this issue because it takes the heat of their own issues. This issue you refer to was brought up by the Katter party not LNP. The media storm that has followed this issue has damaged the LNPs chances of winning even when it was never suggested as one of their priorities. The media loves a good beat up and they have focussed so much on this issue and given labor a helping hand in the process. A few years of LNP in Qld would allow labor to reset and come back strong just like last time. It won‚Äôt be the end of the world despite what the majority of people on this sub believe. The Katter party has a good chance of winning seats in NW queensland regardless of what they say. They have succeeded in driving a wedge into the conservative vote once again while labor can sit and watch the carnage and probably win as a result. Funny thing is that even the Katter party has changed their stance in the last couple of days.
32. As a woman, I am not one bit worried because I can recognise that it‚Äôs nothing but a Labor smear campaign. Nothing will happen with abortion. Stop blindly believing everything spoon fed to you on reddit and the media.
33. If recent history has taught me something, election result fears usually don‚Äôt eventuate to the hype before it. Above all: *Mr Crisafulli has said there would be ‚Äúno changes to abortion law‚Äù* Normally that would dispel concerns, however it doesn‚Äôt seem to in 2024 [Yes it‚Äôs Sky News but that in itself probably is a good thing.](https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/politics/premier-steven-miles-and-lnp-leader-david-crisafulli-spar-on-queensland-abortion-law-in-final-debate-before-state-election/news-story/577c49c29b7604e9bb24fda76df676c5?amp)
34. Selling the fear is working by the looks of it. Elections are won on emotional appeals not logical ones. Turn the socials off and go touch some grass. No party is touching abortion laws, it's just an importation of American political drama and fear by a party that was in the trash poll wise 6 weeks ago.
35. Takes 2 people to create a baby . How bout dad gets a say whether his child has earned a death sentence
36. I voted liberal this time. I‚Äôm a woman but I‚Äôm just sick of paying so much for home insurance. Liberals are supposed to be getting the reinsurance pool sorted. We needed a change in my area so will see what happens.
37. Its disappointing that the left has imported US culture wars to an Australian stste election. The scare campaign on this issue is disgraceful and the Labor party should he ashamed of itself for needlessly causing people such as yourself to worry.
38. Personally I really don‚Äôt have an opinion on the matter but I do tend to have a different view on abortion. It seems very medieval and archaic in my eyes.
39. At worse a half dozen clinics will pop up at tweed. Don‚Äôt let it stress you out. All you can do is vote.
40. I am astounded that so many people don't understand how law making in this country works. If ANYONE thinks that a law preventing late term abortions will pass through our Parliament then you are either deluded or you have been caught up in the media spin and are totally incapable of thinking for yourself... Geezus, people Wake Up! This is QLD, Australia, not the USA ü§¶
41. The mad Katter raised it and it somehow became a wedge issue that has been pushed in a desperate bid for a party on its back foot to claw back ground. Crisafulli has publicly stated he supports the right to choose and that there will be no changes to legislation. Federal LNP has also stated they have no interest in unwinding womens reproductive rights in response to fringe dwellers on the topic attempting to make it a Federal issue. IMO this is pure political maneuvering and will get zero oxygen in Qld after Saturday.
42. Roe V wayde isnt a bad thing, the state no longer has final say on your body. You can now harass and bother local admins until they cave in. For once the constitution was upheld but the media will spin the facts to make it way worse than it actually is.
43. Nothing to be concerned about. The Liberals have always been very caring people. Thats why many Liberal candidates are doctors, while many Labor candidates are Lawyers or former union officials. You‚Äôre in safe hands with the Liberals, caring, safe and loving hands. Don‚Äôt stress. Breathe deep and relax.
44. Unless you are planning to get a late term abortion of a viable pregnancy you have nothing to worry about even if the laws are repealed. Even pre-liberalising of the laws you could get an abortion in QLD with the sign off of a Dr, which included abortionists. Which essentially meant there were no practical limits anyway.
45. I‚Äôm a centrist and just listen to the policies outlined at each election. I have 2 older teen sons and pretty much closed up shop on the child bearing front. I‚Äôll be voting against LNP for their significant others and any future grandchildren and nieces.
46. Not that i believe they are that good for the economy - but even if one does - LNP are full of social conservatives that want to roll back the clock of the rights of women, queers, lock kids up, protect religious peoples right to discriminate. They dont make a secret of it and that isnt the society we should want in a modern Australia.
47. It was only legalised 6 years ago in Queensland. It's still a very shaky issue which is wrong but true.
48. If they went back to the 2018 laws, you could of still gotten that, right
49. LNP ARE NOT CHANGING THE ABORTION LAWS, they have said it enough time, labor has been running on a fear campaign to gain ground because they have nothing else.
50. Thank you. It means so much to so many women.
51. Also almost, not quite a boomer and I second this comment.
52. Make sure you check who they will fall under when elected. A lot of independents vote will go towards either labour or liberal at the end. So make sure your voting for the independent were your vote will make the most difference. 100% pro woman, and pro woman's rights. It's horrifying Australia going down the same route of America. Disgusting country.
53. ACT hasn't voted Libs for over 23 years and the last time they did they blew up a hospital and killed a child..... Still its annoying Labor can be so useless also, not as racist or homophobic but generally useless.
54. If all the progressives in Qld could swap places with the old liberals in Tassie so we can finally get rid of these fuckwits from my beautiful state, that would be amazing. Edit: I'm Tasmanian in case that wasn't clear and it looked like I was calling Qld progressives fuckwits
55. Absolutely!! I would gladly protest any change that takes us backwards. Makes me angry that this would need to happen though.
56. Or mass exodus the state and let them have it. More LNP cronies move in, making it better everywhere else to live üëå They can lock up they own kids and I guess they can afford all the mass inflation that would hit due them all trying to fuck each other over and force each other to rent out they're own shit
57. > protesting is dangerous in this country Not compared to almost any other country in the world.
58. Full English soccer fan riot loud? That kinda loud seems to be appropriate.
59. Protesting is dangerous in this country? Where are you planning on protesting, Tiananmen Square?? This would have to go down as the dumbest comment I've seen on socials in a long, long time! And typical leftard... 'If you disagree with me I'm going to just yell at you'
60. I doubt you ever had voted LNP just from the fact you call them a hate based party, lefty lol.
61. And this right here is why we need to stop them getting in. It‚Äôs not just about babies and birth, it‚Äôs about health care, miscarriages that don‚Äôt complete, ectopic pregnancy that is life threatening. There is so much more to reproductive health care than reactive banning of a medical procedure. Women have died from not having this procedure and the only people it should concern are the Drs, nurses and the patients. Not old white men who want to police woman‚Äôs bodies.
62. I just saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/s/F9nzO0Y5XO) Kamala Harris abortion ad and thought how it fits with our fight too.
63. Thank you. It means a lot to so many women you'll never meet or know.
64. I also have a brain, and those wanting to 'punish' women for having sex, which is obviously all the so-called 'pro-life' movement cares about based on all their actions, insults my intelligence so much that it makes me their enemy just to hear their dumb lies. When they can't even lie well, it embarrassed humanity, and I don't like how they embarrass me. Most of us are only held back by some sort of morality. They're not held back and still absolutely suck at it. The worst of humanity who make me lose faith in my own species every time they open their mouths for another dumb lie.
65. Just make sure you tell your daughter it's Labor, not Labour.
66. Agreed. Lets be real, we are talking about human rights and mens rights are next. The sooner men of Australia understand this the better. Stop being selfish or naive because they're not going to make exceptions for men.
67. Ima buy late to the party. What are the libs actually proposing? Gimmie the facts no emotion please. I was gonna go vote lnp tomorrow but let me know what the go is? Yeah I could google but you good people seem to know. I want a legit run down.
68. Can tell you have swallowed labor fear campaign hook line and sinker.
69. I think they‚Äôre still favourites but the polls say it‚Äôs going to be a bit closer apparently
70. They have "solving youth crime" on their page. Great to know they dont do their research; anyone who did would know that criminologists have found youth crime to be down not up
71. I have private health, because I'm still eligible to be on my parents (who have it because of the penalties) and it's a complete waste of money. Private hospitals are not equipped to deal with complex issues and if you go private, and have complications you end up in the public hospital anyway. Private health basically speeds up the process or gives you the flexibility to schedule surgeries on a timeline that suits you. Outside of that the benefits are few and far between and lots of people still use public services anyway.
72. You are penalised if you don‚Äôt have private health due the MC surcharge. Basically everyone has private health.
73. Pretty much every LNP campaign I have seen or heard... Going back for almost 20 years actually now I think about it... Coincidence..? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
74. I think I know the one you're talking about- she's all over social media. I saw a clip of her going up to Miles and questioning him- it was odd, she's quite aggressive. I didn't realise she's head of a university department üòµ
75. God the bullshit selective memory of the ‚Äúgood ol‚Äôdays‚Äù pisses me off. I like to ask those asking for that if they are also ok with returning to having hash, heroin and cocaine available over the counter from any pharmacy just like the ‚Äúgood ol day days‚Äù. Of course they are not in favour of those good ol days, just the ones that let them treat certain people as less than people and control their women folk like cattle.
76. And the LNP candidates are absolutely getting smashed by this issue. I hope they get smashed in the results.
77. Cairns here. I have a few left you can stick on your fence too
78. Labour? Why not the Greens? Labour is alright but they are screwing the pooch when it comes to the housing crisis. /genuine
79. labor fear campaign on abortion will not happen the LNP has said enough times they will not be changing the laws on them.
80. Umm that's the minister of Economic Development. Is there a reason you said the 'prime minister'
81. leave amercia media alone mate sounds like its really rotten your brain, and labor fear campaign on abortion will not happen the LNP has said enough times they will not be changing the laws on them.
82. Go one better and vote Green! Not enough people use our preferential voting system to its fullest advantage.
83. That would feel like a betrayal. Especially considering your circumstances. It's a real shame that friend of yours lacks perspective. That cognitive dissonance could be something they could think about and change, but they don't. While I'd like to say you possibly could change their mind, reality is if they haven't given you a consideration after that chat, why would they later?
84. You live here? You have a valid say. Just can‚Äôt register that point.
85. Because, like the Cannabis debate, they trot out the bullshit concept of ‚Äúwell it was different in my time‚Äù. No. Crime was crime. And some young people going slightly off the rails don‚Äôt need draconian jail sentences to graduate them to full qualified social terrorists, they are more in need of rehabilitation. Using the government to tackle the underlying issues that lead to juvenile delinquency (which Miles is actually doing by directly tackling cost of living issues) is by far the best use of tax payer resources.
86. 100%. I‚Äôd go higher, but sadly I tap out at full and total support.
