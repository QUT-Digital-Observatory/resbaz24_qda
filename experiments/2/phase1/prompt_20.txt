Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Yeah, it's been a nice read. Watching people argue about how the greens failed was also a good read. Lots of seethe. I'm pretty sure most leftists don't understand there is a Queensland north and west of the local bus network. The next Federal election will be good value as well.
2. > only offering pencils to write with Why is that an issue?
3. Are you suggesting it was rigged? Are you so blind to the fact that policy effects all people of all circumstance and what is important to you means nothing to others? The majority voted for the policies that most affect them and you can blame ignorance or sky news all you like. How many people and from what walk of life did you speak to out of interest? Over 2 million?
4. I'm going to have to disagree here. I know that I'm coming into an age where I am going to be labelled as a "doofus" for my strong yet naive political opinions, but I do know this - voter apathy is the death of democracy. If we all were to succumb to this mentality, then we become complacent to the bullshit that some political groups will push, because they know that the general public will not care. This is what gets abortion laws reversed, and other stupid shit to get introduced. So I encourage you, when the next election happens, spread the word, it doesn't have to be much. It could be something as silly as a rumour you heard, like, "Did you hear about Crisafulli's public spotify account?". And then you don't have to do it for another 4 or so years. That's all.
5. Doesn't make me uncomfortable at all, I'm pointing out that if you want your shit post to actually be read by the people that put the LNP into power, go post on those subreddits.
6. Something you must understand is QLD is that unlike SA people actually live outside the capital. And for whatever reasons they chose LNP and outvoted us.
7. go back to south australia where you belong you alien!
8. They're implying that someone could rub out his vote and change it.
9. In true fairness there should be no room for doubt. If you want to have blind faith in a system, seek religion, and stay out of politics.
10. I figured that, I just wanted them to say it.
11. You would have been the first one to laugh at trump for blaming election rigging. Now you're trying to do it yourself. You're also pretending to speak for 5.2 million people in a lefty subreddit. Time to grow up. Your problems aren't the states problems.
12. Yep, thats why im not a teacher, hate dealing with children.
13. Well, that, and teachers have to have some kind of intelligence to pass along.
14. Good, the QSAC proposal was an absolutely brain dead concept
15. The only, and I mean only, positive thing that came with the election result for me. I hope they go forward with a Gabba rebuild but the second best option would be a new stadium in Vic Park imo. For everything else with the new LNP government, god help us.
16. Damn, was looking forward to the opening ceremony showing off the beautiful QSAC stadium with the cemetery in the background.
17. Thank god what an awful decision this was by the previous government
18. Interesting choice of language at the end of the article "The conservative party will now rule for a four-year term until 2028." In a democracy governments are meant to 'govern' not 'rule' but hey...
19. Lol, mods shut me down this morning for creating an Olympic thread now that QSAC won't be going ahead. https://preview.redd.it/hbik9z988axd1.jpeg?width=1337&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=331d318469c3c32838b43ecbc80c223c2de2e851
20. Yeah fuck you Townsville, we're getting a 2 billion dollar sports ground, you guys can live in tents.
21. New government - actually invest in a legacy stadium please. We are still benefitting from the game changer that was Expo and its legacy, and the Gabba is at end of life. The last review made it clear Vic Park was the best option… so do that!
22. Good on him. QSAC is the kind of place you hold high school athletics.
23. I voted for labour but if the libs can pull a good stadium plan out of their ass and begin construction I’ll have to give them credit.
24. The first and only good thing to come from the LNP government.
25. Very keen for a potential Portside redevelopment. 160 acres is publicly owned land, athletes village can be turned into housing afterwards (airport noise may be an issue), massive upgrade and development of that part of the river, state of the art stadium built by people that have recent accomplishments in some of the most high tech stadiums in the world, increase in public transport to an area that lacks it, and according to plans, to no cost to the tax payer. https://ministryofsport.com/6-billion-northshore-proposal-to-solve-brisbane-2032-olympic-infrastructure-challenges/#:~:text=The%20proposed%20plan%20addresses%20Brisbane's,affordable%20and%20market%2Drate%20housing.
26. If he scraps the Olympics I MIGHT hate him a tiny fraction less
27. The Olympics we had to have but moreover the olympics that Brisbane can’t look outside the box to host. Not surprised.
28. Right decision, still worried about his royalties tax cut and the public sector
29. Northside still has my vote. Gabba has no room for more amenities such as restaurants whereas Northside will
30. I still think Toombul shopping centre isn't completely done and dusted as an option yet.
31. Seemed like LNP were angling for a power move all along. LNP says the Gabba reno sucks - makes everyone hate the idea (because they don’t want the Olympics). Labor stupidly tries to placate the public by saying oh well we'll build it somewhere else, like say QSAC (maybe, maybe not, we’re still running numbers). LNP wins election, does a 100-day review and announces they’re going to do a big reno on the Gabba!
32. Gabba precinct will be brilliant with no stadium there. Apartments surrounding a nice park with lots of restaurants and bars. Close to CRR. Makes sense. And VIC Park makes sense. In 10 years everyone should look back and say it was a great decision. Now for them to fuck it up same as Miles did. 🤦🏻‍♂️
33. New Olympic stadium to be built on the old Toombul shopping centre site near the airport. Watch this space.
34. Putting my money on Vic Park. Gabba site is too small
35. That’s one thing he and I agree on. For a grand total of one thing.
36. Did anyone consider the option of building an Olympic park between Rocklea and Corinda?
37. I'd prefer a Gabba rebuild but I can see why it's troublesome especially since they stupidly built Highrise apartments directly opposite, but is there some reason why we can't shuffle a bit to the left(west) and just build a New Gabba over the Transport Hub and prob also over Stanly st by taking out some of those small businesses. Then tear down the old Gabba and turn that into the green space and social housing. Solves the space issues, transport issues, NIMBY school issues and allows sports to continue in the old while they build the new.
38. We should never have bid for the olympics. ALP deserved to get shithoused for that alone.
39. Maan this guy looks shady AF. I bet by the end of his term there'll be inquiry on this guy. It's almost certain
40. So not waiting for an independent review, just hiding the fact from regional Queenslanders that they were going to go for a more expensive stadium with less funding being covered by the IOC
41. Oh no he should’ve done all of the things that the current government did that’s why people voted otherwise. What an outrage.
42. Common sense prevails here. Hopefully the Gabba gets knocked down and rebuilt and they remove some seats at QSAC so it can be turned into an oval for the Lions to play at in the meantime.
43. Good, and Labor would have done the same thing I reckon. It was a nonsense political squabble during the election, so I’m glad they can get on with things now.
44. But why? Good access, especially with metro, much better access than the gabba or suncorp. Less disruptive to the city for construction. Room to grow.
45. Yep, the one thing I woke up this morning that I could find a positive with was the Olympic stadium plan.
46. Don't think they can't ballz up a stadium plan. Their private property developers and investors will have them making bad decisions in no time.
47. Barrambin really doesn't have the space for a stadium without it being the only thing there. It might look like a big park on the map, but the elevation changes are massive.
48. Libs ruled out any new stadia, many of them re-iterated this under questioning on election night
49. these are both horrible plans. especially victoria park. why my fellow queenslanders hate green space is beyond me.
50. Its only day one so i guess thats pretty good.
51. How stadiums are a priority for anyone at the moment is ridiculous.
52. North shoes Hamilton would be an amazing option, and wouldn’t cost us much because the private company said they’ll completely build it
53. Oh well you got your wish. Be happy with the rest. But you’re not the only one that can’t look outside the box. Queenslanders definitely lack vision.
54. I look forward to the "Crisafulli scraps himself" when he can't keep the promise to lower youth crime. I'm pretty sure he promised to resign if he won and failed on that promise.
55. Single house and clear majority means they are basically ruling.
56. Doesn’t take long for the Murdoch media to fall back in to the mould when the libs get in to power. Remember it’s the birth right of the libs to rule us.
57. Didn’t Brownsville get a new stadium a few years back?
58. Vic park isn't the best option, it's superficially the easiest option. Contrary to the review, the Gabba rebuild could be done if the State Government was willing to play around with the idea of either deleting or cut/ covering Stanley St or Vulture St. That may seem like an absurdly high additional expense, but it may be the lesser evil - If Vic park is the site, we would have two stadiums within 2km of each other, and would certainly need to invest significant amounts into upgrading the already critically strained and dated inner west road and public transport networks. And Wooloongabba without a stadium would make the past 40 years of townplanning and investment in that precinct wasted. Wooloongabba would be a CBD adjacent precint of 5 lane urban highways and highrises - a soulless and irrelevant suburb to drive through on the way to Southbank.
59. What do you propose is done with the decaying skeleton of the Gabba once it reaches end of life?
60. Developers are already putting all their money into the gabba area and are among LNP's biggest donors. Victoria park ain't happening. If the review says vic park is the way to go they will just keep doing more reviews until someone says the gabba is the way to go. How else do you explain every review that was occurred yet more are happening.
61. They also promised to get rail to Maroochydore by 2032. An ambitious achievement, which I doubt they will manage anyway, but hats off to them if they do
62. They were already planning to build the athletes village in Hamilton anyway. I’ve come around to the idea of the Stadium being in Hamilton too, plenty of space and good chance to further redevelop the area. They just need to extend the Doomben Line. And maybe extend the Metro to the airport via Hamilton to give direct access.
63. Too expensive to be palatable to voters in north Queensland
64. Gabba already has tons of good restaurants around, easily walkable, and transport links
65. Unfortunately, the Gabba doesn't even have anywhere in the athletes can warm up.
66. Main Street Maccas is all the restaurant I’ll ever need when heading to the Gabba
67. Problem is without the Gabba developers don’t see a reason to invest in the area. You will see all proposals drop like flies. There’s a reason developers land banked for over 10 years in parts around the Gabba.
68. It's not the worst idea, add a new air train station to go with the Toombul station and you have good public transport access But Mirvac won't be keen on selling.
69. I believe it's all flood plain their...that doesn't stop them from building houses etc...but I have heard its just flood area
70. Why there? Nothing's interesting around the area. Transport system is even worse than QSAC.
71. The QSAC plan was so bad it doesn't really deserve further consideration.
72. The games are less than eight years away now. Frankly, another review is time time wasting.
73. Good access? Gabba is next door to the CRR train.
74. Good access, especially with the metro? Where’s the metro stop? QSAC also doesn’t have the public transport capabilities it used to have when it was QE2. Gabba makes much more sense, especially with the purpose built transit hub you may or may not have seen already underway.
75. Good access for who? I lived out there for years and it was horrible to commute to or from. Even with a new busway connection(that wasn’t part of the $1.6billion), Suncorp and Gabba both have heavy rail stations with commuter capacity several times greater than any busway service will ever provide. It will take hours to clear capacity crowds from QSAC via the Busway.. I’ve been there and experienced it through ACDC concert. Gabba and Suncorp are both centrally located meaning they’re more accessible to both sides of the river, and Ipswich region also.
76. >Good access, especially with metro, much better access than the gabba or suncorp. What absolute dribble! For a start, "Metro" 🙄 doesn't serve QSAC. It also only has a capacity of ~180 people. NGR Trains carry 964. Gabba will have a railway station AND a busway station. It is far more accessible than QSAC. QSAC is a relic of 1980s urban planning.
77. >much better access than the gabba or sun This is really funny
78. Are you dense? The stadium is over 10kms from the city, nearby one of the worst intersections in SEQ, has no effective public transport options besides buses, and it’s in a completely urban sprawled section of the outer metro area. Room to grow? Where?
79. God, if LNP can just settle this debate I’d vote for them. Great news is making wildly unpopular decisions is like water off a ducks back for LNP. They got this.
80. And relying on expanding the park by building over the ICB would be the first thing cut to save money
81. The proposal from Archipelago results in no net loss of publicly accessible green open space. https://archipelago-interactive.com.au/
82. The plan is to build over the ICB and use the flatter area in the dip. They are not carving out the hillside
83. Their policy is to have a 100 day review. They ruled out a new stadium for now but if they review is similar to the one commissioned earlier, I believe they will switch to it. It’s theatrics to make the decision palatable I reckon.
84. If you read the plan, it’ll actually increase greenhouse gas emissions space because they’ll be putting gardens all around the stadium
85. It has to be a priority now. Now that they've won the right to host the games. They shouldn't have bid for it in the first place without working all this stuff out though. Ridiculous that we're still talking about where the stadium will be.
86. He walked that back on Friday and broke an election promise before he was even premier.
87. I feel like Stanly and Vulture need to go even if they don't put a stadium there, especially as it is to become a public transport hub now. Those roads restrict active transport access to that transport hub.
88. I can't see any way of doing the Gabba without sending one or both of those roads underground. The Gabba isn't my preferred option (I think Vic Park is the all round best solution) but I wouldn't be too mad about it, but imo they have to do that with Vulture/Stanley, otherwise it'll still just have all the same traffic and pedestrian problems but with even more people. One of the big difficulties (and costs) of doing the Gabba is building a suitable temporary home for the Lions & cricket while they build it, one that won't result in a decimation of their membership. I'm a lions member and if I had to travel to Springfield or the Gold Coast, I simply wouldn't renew, and neither would most other members I know. Vic Park solves that. It's already within 20 min walking distance of like 50 platforms of heavy rail, and multiple bus & metro stations.
89. I mean, they were going to tear it down for the rebuild anyway so giving the space to developers to build apartments for overseas investors seems like a thing the government would do.
90. Make the site a PDA and get EDQ to bulldoze it and subdivide it. Renovate & improve the school. Build some social housing on part of the land. Sell the rest to developers to build mixed use commercial, retail & residential buildings. Use that revenue to help fund the new stadium.
91. Serious question here, I go to the Gabba a few times a year and I dont see any major reason to demolish it? Its facilities seem ok? Im no structural engineer but whats the issue (eg has it got concrete cancer?) that prevents them just renovating/expanding it and maintaining some of the existing structure to save money?
92. Knock it down and meticulously transplant the pitch square into the new Vic Park stadium.
93. Send a very nastily worded letter to the muppets who decided to build a stadium with a 30 year life span? There is literally nothing wrong with the stadium, it’s absolutely fit for purpose.
94. The problem I have is that every review found that Barrambin was the best option because an Olympic stadium doesn't fit at the Gabba - because geometry. The only kind of review that will recommend the Gabba must first prove that a square is a circle and 1+1=3. I wouldn't put it past corrupt Crissafuli to make that happen, but still..
95. Didn't agree with Labor about qsac and really want Maroochydore rail asap. If they at least change those 2 things I'll be a little happy. Not enough to make me. Vote lnp, but maybe I won't be as diappointed in them as I would otherwise be.
96. Not even close to it, IOC would pay for all the other stands except the main side Instead of regurgitating something that someone who can't think for themself says. Tell me, if QSAC was the most expensive option forthe government for the "worst" option , why wasn't this "slam dunk" policy announced during the campaign, surely all of Queensland would have loved it.
97. Well if you don't like it, seems like a good enough reason to outright exclude our only athletics stadium from the consoderation of where to build a multibillion dollar athletics stadium, of what is meant to be an independent review
98. Quite possibly, would be nice if the Quirk review actually released the mapping and more details of what they reviewed, rather than leaving the Archipelago designs as the only image that all news pieces use when referring to the Vic Park plan, when we have no idea where the stadium was meant to be sited
99. QSAC is only 3 km from the train line. It is surely possible to build something like Olympic Park line in Sydney?
100. Lane closures on vulture St, mains Rd, Wellington rd and Stanley St, for upgrades? Hasn't crr and metro been enough of a disruption?
101. I'd argue that suncorp is not compatible with pedestrian traffic from trains, most people commute to and from there by bus or rides hare.
102. For comm games on the gc, almost everything was delayed, because a lot of it was hosted in high traffic areas.
103. Hi. Building over the ICB was not put forward by Quirk in his stadium report. It was not included in the $3.4 billion. It’s an idea pushed by Archipelago Architects and others in the property sector. If you look at the park and then at Archipelago Architect pictures you will see that the placing of the stadium etc don’t even take into account the topography nor the fact that there is heritage listing in many of the area he proposed to throw a build over.
104. No net loss? Is not the same as no loss.
105. There's a million more important things to focus on than a freaking sports stadium.
106. I mean we should give this guy a shot to see how he behaves. The next election is 4 years away. Plenty of time to call him out between now and then. Love or hate him, he’s here to stay, we’re under one team now, team Queensland.
107. That’s the best cricket pitch in the country you wanna tear down and replace with a lame drop in pitch.
108. This is actually exactly what happened when Arsenal football club moved form Highbury stadium to Emirates in the early 2000s in London. But the team got a far superior stadium…
109. Why would they not just get revenue from selling land elsewhere to developers and put a world class stadium right next to the brand new CRR train station rather than gut that area of the one major economic asset that it has? Could you imagine how irrelevant woolloongabba would be without the Gabba?
110. Surely social housing next to a primary school is a bad idea?
111. I've had these same questions. As a spectator, apart from the bloody sun shining right in your eyes in the late afternoon at the eastern end, there's nothing wrong with the Gabba. And I'm pretty sure everyone parroting the line that it's not fit for purpose has no clue what the real issues are because nobody ever fucking says why. So I read the government's review, and, well, now I know. From the perspective of the Gabba staff and the athletes, it's shithouse. I'm just going to plagiarise bits of the report here: \* The roof structure (especially the tensioned fabric construction) is coming to the end of its design life, noting that some of the roof failed in 2008 and required replacement and strengthening. \* There is localised degradation in sections of the steel structure which will need to be further assessed and addressed. \* Steel structure corrosion protection is at the end of its protective life with areas of surface corrosion needing repair as part of regular maintenance. \* Cooling and ventilation plant and equipment is at the end of its life and requires replacement. \* Lighting and services infrastructure needs upgrading to meet changes in sporting requirements. \* Lifts and vertical transport suffer from performance and reliability issues. \* Fire life safety systems will require upgrading to meet changes in standards following further assessment. Then there's functionality: \* An ambulance is unable to enter the field of play because the structure is too low for the height of ambulances. Due to the narrowness of back-of-house corridors, even the much smaller Medicab cannot take players all the way to medical rooms. Instead, injured players must be carried by stretcher because of the narrowness of spaces. \* AFL player facilities for the home team, including warm up spaces, fall well short of being acceptable. The facilities for visiting teams are appalling, with rooms too small for players, no air conditioning and the need for makeshift ice baths outside toilet cubicles. \* There are no female change or WC areas in the current stadium which means female athletes are required to change in men’s changing and WC/shower areas. \* Facilities for catering staff are second rate. Lack of dedicated ‘break out’ space at the venue often means that staff do not get breaks simply because it is too far for them to walk to the single staff rest area. \* Moving food and drinks to various outlets around the stadium is challenging, not in keeping with modern expectations and highly inefficient. This issue is compounded by a lack of storage spaces, which means food outlets have to be restocked several times during events. This is made worse by the fact that there is no back-of-house circular delivery system which results in staff using the general public concourse to transfer goods. \* There is generally little access to the field of play. Any large items requiring installation need to be located in advance of event operations and require the removal of part of the concourse floor, making it inaccessible for patrons and staff to move around the venue. \* The loading dock is too small and inefficient and removal of waste from the site is difficult. \* Lounges and corporate suites are ageing and are not considered in line with contemporary stadiums nationally. There's plenty more. Like u/Pearlsam said, google the review and it's all there in black and white.
112. A comments section on reddit is probably not the best place to get an answer from. Google the "Sport Venue Review" the state government put out in march. It runs through the reasons the Gabba isn't good.
