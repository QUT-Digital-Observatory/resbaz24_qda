Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. I mean, they can _say_ whatever they want, however laws are federal and sentencing up to individual magistrates/judges. There‚Äôs also international bodies who would start action about this. So it sounds great but the location probably won‚Äôt happen like they ‚Äúpromised‚Äù.
2. You think too old, its like NT where they arrest 10 year olds now. We need to throw them in jail when they are young.
3. It has worked. It got the LNP elected. That was the goal.
4. When your 5 year old commits tax evasion, stealing millions from the public, he gets off with a slap on the wrist. But if he steals something from Woolies, 15 years in prison
5. It won‚Äôt lol, it‚Äôs taking an issue and making it worse under the guise of added ‚Äúhard time and punishment‚Äù without you know the rehabilitation part or addressing the economic issues as to why these kids are the way they are.
6. Is funneling money into a business you become sole director for considered an adult crime? ü§î He knows that by the time the kids get out of jail it will be a Labor problem
7. The LNP probably should of read this report from 1992, when we had these same issues. https://www.ccc.qld.gov.au/sites/default/files/Docs/Publications/CJC/Youth-crime-and-justice-in-qld-Report-1992.pdf
8. I must be cynical - I was thinking they have a buddy or two with privatised prisons but there arent any in QLD.
9. Sounds like a good way to indoctrinate impressionable teenagers into organised crime networks in prisons.
10. >After 16 years we have a 30 year old who hasn‚Äôt been part of society Pretty sure that's the point, plenty of contracts for private prisons and then a nice retirement package after office. Also as a bonus it creates larger issues that a tough on crime political party needs to be voted in to solve.
11. They should transport them to a colony at the far end of the world.
12. Maybe, and I'm just speculating, when 13/14/15 year olds see other teens their age going to prison for 15+ years instead of getting sent home after committing serious crimes, they might possibly reconsider their own behaviour. I'm not necessarily advocating it as the ideal deterrent or solution, but I'm guessing that's the idea they're going with.
13. Youth detention is a known causative effect of later reoffending. Not that there's just a correlation; if a kid is put in detention, from that act alone there is a MUCH greater chance they commit more crimes later in life. Just another way the LNP is going to fuck QLD for future generations.
14. The 30 year old gets out and starts a dysfunctional family of his own. 14 years later he‚Äôs helped create the youth crime problem for the LNP to campaign on in 2056. It actually is long term thinking.
15. They won't do anything. Statistically youth crime is lower than it's every been. I don't think they will do shit, crisafuckface put his job on the line... But they will just regurgitate current data and say that it's down and take credit
16. Not to rag on the LNP, but this policy, for me at least, was a bizarre slogan to campaign on. As an ‚Äúambulance at the bottom of the cliff‚Äù policy, its only potential value seems to be as a deterrent, which doesn‚Äôt address the problem. Government people aren‚Äôt known for their creative solutions and this one is par for the course. Everything you said was right about a 30 year old dysfunctional adult being released into society.
17. nobody knows, not even crisafooli we just gotta wait and find out, and then he will resign if it fails, but then he won't because it wasn't a core promise, it's non-core
18. The same kids that apparently aren't mature enough to use social media, are at the same time mature enough to do "adult time".
19. It won't work, and it'll be even harder for Crisafooli to implement now that he's forcing the QLD Police to cut millions of dollars in costs not even two full days into his term as premier. Something about them being "over budget" even though the state was in a multi-billion-dollar surplus...
20. Adult crime is committed by someone with an adult brain. Kids don't have that.
21. Presumably, it means that elderly people are no longer considered for lighter sentences? Studies around the world have found that it is the elderly that benefit most from age consideration during sentencing. Sucks for them that they will now lose that perk.
22. It‚Äôs a slogan not a policy. Now LNP problem to work all that out. Sucks to suck.
23. It won't work, that's the thing. It's a "solution" put forward by bigots & people completely ignorant of what actually causes crime.
24. The LNP haven't defined anything actually. They won their campaign by slandering Labor and producing youth crime scare campaigns on public television. They can't even provide a concrete stance on abortion, does anyone know what they plan to do other than drain the surplus?
25. Don't stress. It's a political promise and won't happen. Then at the next election, it'll be the other party's fault and "We need more time. Stop them from undoing all of our good work, that you can't see the results of yet because we've been undoing all the damage the last lot caused!" Then guess what happens...
26. All good. It's only for the poor who can't afford a good lawyer.
27. It was a beat-up, a piece of propaganda and misinformation, aided & abetted by the Murdoch media.. the data doesn‚Äôt lie and it clearly shows ‚Äòyouth crime‚Äô has dropped statewide.. it just gets lots of clicks on news.com and the other junk news sites that most rednecks and hicks get their content from‚Ä¶ Sky news broadcasts into regional Qld for free for Fucksake and it‚Äôs nothing but venal bigotry & ignorance packaged up in a thin veneer of sloppy makeup and contradictory logic. Until we wrest control of our media back from Murdoch the maggot, nothing will change.
28. It‚Äôs really stupid bc while some crimes are youth offenders, the majority of crimes are mostly all 18+ years old. So the ‚Äúadult time‚Äù bs is just that= complete bs. It was just a campaign tactic. And if you look at America where they lock kids up like adults it actually has the opposite effect and creates more crime and more career criminals. That‚Äôs the data and has been for decades. But the US is okay with that bc the penal system is mostly run by for-profit private prisons.
29. Apparently the QLD police have been told to make cuts to reel their budget back in. So we will have to catch them first.
30. Let's be real here - this is a catch cry to appease the general public who crave retribution and perceived justice, rolled out in order to get someone elected. By the time these kids are at the age of committing crime, most have come from a less than loving home with less-than-ideal morals - no amount of "Adult Time" will fix this as its ingrained into them and their way of life. Adult Time is not a deterrent when you are high, breaking into houses in order to fund your habit. What are your options at that point? Get a job that you can't hold down because a) you have an addiction, and b) work ethic and social morals were dirty words in your home growing up? Prison is just part of the cycle. We'll see a small improvement as the ones who would have currently been incarcerated for 6 months are now in prison for 2 years, postponing their reoffending. The stats will look good for the short term, and victory will be claimed, but ultimately the cycle will continue.
31. It is a recipe for creating hardened criminals. We have plenty of studies and research that shows that exact outcome. We also have research that shows that harsh penalties don't do a good job of deterring children from crimes. A 30 year sentence versus 4 year sentence has almost no difference in deterrent value for young kids. Their executive functions and frontal lobes aren't fully developed yet, so they make irrational and impulsive decisions. So not only are we creating hardened adult criminals, likely with mental health issues, but we aren't deterring crime in the first place. The only impact is more kids behind bars which will reduce crime until they get out....likely after Crisafulli has left office.
32. The cynical part of me thinks that older people voted for the LNP to lock away kids (just not their own grandkids of course) and have them kept behind bars until‚Ä¶ well until they‚Äôre dead and it‚Äôs not their problem? It feels like an extension of nymbism. As long as their neighbourhood is safe and clean they don‚Äôt really give a fuck what happens to all the kids who probably have shit home lives and 0 guidance and support to become functioning members of society. In reality I think the LNP will be stuck in a bureaucratic nightmare trying to make this a thing and end up spending a lot of taxpayer money for no tangible benefits
33. Simple : It wont. the only solution is massive increases of funding to education and youth support services. But to do that they would require tax of mining areas.
34. Most up to date parenting advice suggests that a time out longer than 5-10 minutes (i.e. long enough to think about what they've done) is counterproductive. Not sure that 5 years+ is going to make the kid more responsible.
35. Simple. It won‚Äôt work. The research is very clear that it doesn‚Äôt work as a deterrent, but that‚Äôs not the only purpose of custodial sentences. It doesn‚Äôt rehabilitate them either as your post points out. It might protect society for a while, but prisons are known for teaching people how to be better criminals. That only leaves denouncement (letting them know they did a bad thing) and punishment. Those can be achieved with other methods of sentencing. I can only assume it‚Äôs designed to achieve ‚Äòout of sight, out of mind‚Äô.
36. Not trying to turn this into a US politics post, but this comment from Gov Walz I believe hits the nail on the head. "You either pay for school buses and school lunches or prison buses and prison meals. It makes more sense to book on the front end." [https://youtube.com/shorts/9iiRwuRkVv4?si=O\_kXE9jv5R6y-3i3](https://youtube.com/shorts/9iiRwuRkVv4?si=O_kXE9jv5R6y-3i3)
37. It's another conservative slogan. A bit like the US, these conservatives love simple 'solutions' to complex problems.
38. Why are you asking logical questions? It's not about finding solutions or preventing crime, it's about hiding the results of crime. Putting someone in a place so they can forget about them. Just don't tell them what the financial cost will be.
39. I work in this space, in reality I don‚Äôt think anyone knows yet, if someone says they do, they‚Äôre probably bullshitting. It‚Äôs a case of ‚Äòwait and see.‚Äô
40. What would you propose as an alternative? We could adopt the norwegian form of rehab, enormously expensive though
41. While said offender is incarcerated, they are not invading homes and murdering mothers. THAT is the point. Their friends learn that the court system is no longer a revolving door/minor inconvenience which theyll be out of in an hour, and start modifying their behaviour. THAT is the point. A juvenile who has no family support finally gets the beginning of an education while inside, and decides to make a change. THAT is the point. Focusing solely on the offender and their hypothetical position more than a decade after an admittedly heinous offence is a clear indication that victims are irrelevant, and the reality of impact to victims has been downplayed so much that a complete absence of personal responsibility is somehow ok now
42. Yeah the long term consequences of that approach will be catastrophic.
43. Using the recent NT change to lower the age of criminal responsibility will mean that a child will spend their entire youth and adulthood in jail. If the tough on crime goes even further, said 10 year old could well spend the rest of their lives in prison
44. God why don't people ask the basic obvious questions BEFORE they vote for fools? This is n excellent question. The answer, long or short of it, is NO. It will not work. I have yet to be convinced what is actually "adult" crime. Stealing is a crime, whether you're an adult or not.
45. it wont. its just a catchy slogan for boomers and braindead morons to latch on to.
46. Oh yeah... Literally the only impact it will have on "youth" crime will be that some youth criminals won't be able to commit crimes for a time because they will be in prison. Then they will be released, and go on to commit far more serious crimes as adults. So a few years from now, we'll see an increase in serious adult crimes... probably long after the LNP have been booted from office, and the LNP will no doubt blame it all on Labor.
47. How long should the child who stabbed and killed the grandma Infront of her granddaughter be put away for? Until he's 18? Surely they will have straightened out by then right? I'd prefer he stays behind bars until he's 30 personally. Minimum. I don't really give two shots about the perpetrators, if you can't be reasonably confident they won't reoffend the safety of non violent innocent civilians comes before that of someone willing to murder someone over a fkn bag or car
48. They will have plenty of opportunity to better themselves in prison. If they choose to become a hardened criminal and continue to prey on people then that‚Äôs on them and they will likely have the shit life they deserve. The justice system is already far too lenient.
49. 1) Put 14 year old in prison for 16 years. 2) Privatise prisons. 3) Wait for institutionalised 30 year old to reoffend. 4) Profit.
50. If LNP were to do it properly, it would mean providing proper in-'patient' care for youth offenders. I.e. youth workers, education, mental and physical health care, etc. These centers would ideally be located in community, to help reintegrate the offender. They shouldn't be left to rot.
51. That 14 year old, won‚Äôt commit crimes for the 16 year period. They won‚Äôt bash, stab, steal from anyone during this time. There is a very small percentage of youths committing most of the offences. Locking two or three of these criminals up will probably make their mates think twice, but maybe not.
52. Sure, it is actually pretty easy. You arrest children, give them adult sentences and then imprison them in a for profit prison where they are hardened into criminals and released as dangerous adults with no skills. Then you arrest them after they inevitably reoffend and then do it all over again. Repeat customers for your private prison mates and then you're vindicated when you say crime is worse than ever and only you have what it takes to keep people safe - just look how many people you've already arrested and put in jail. Edit: many Autocorrect typos
53. The current law states: "In Queensland, if a child commits an offence, the law says that the child should generally be kept out of the criminal justice system, unless this is not appropriate because of the type of offence they've committed and their previous offending history." This leads to situations such as the one in Northlakes a few years back, where a teenager convicted of 84 offences related to break-ins or attempted break-ins of homes or cars murdered a woman during a home invasion. Or the one where teenagers driving a stolen car crashed into an innocent driver killing them. No one is saying we should lock up little Jimmy for stealing a loaf of bread, or for spray painting a wall. But at some point between the 1st and 84th conviction the judicial system needs to step in, punishment needs to be issued, or the very least the perpetrator removed from society (locked up) to protect society. And ideally before they end up killing someone. One kids wellbeing does not outweigh the massive harm they can cause to everyone else around them. I grew up in Mount Isa and now live in Brisbane, and look I get it. Youth crime is not a problem here. It's hard to imagine sweet innocent children as criminals. But reality is harsh in the regions. Kids are roaming the streets with no parental figures, breaking into homes, brandishing knifes, and stealing cars. They face no consequences for their actions, they are untouchable, and they know it. If you think that kids should be able to roam the streets and commit crimes with impunity, then you are part of the problem.
54. "Youth crime" is just another LNP money laundering scam so that when they give all the money to mining companies and people ask, where did my bloody taxes go? they can say they made the streets safer (they won't)
55. It won‚Äôt work on crime It‚Äôs to sound good for the bogans
56. Under the current system violent recidivist criminals were never held accountable for anything, remember these little darlings commit an absolute shit load of violent crimes long before any judge puts them behind bars. Take for example Mrs Lovetts murdering piece of shit sub human Many many crimes involving violence, but not until he did his first home invasion with an knife and attempting to kill the home owner did he even look like jail time. And no it wasnt her. He went to court initially for attempted murder, which what it was, much discussion with the judge and the lawyers and a long look at Sect 150 (2) YJA and it was decided it was best for all involved that the charges would be heavily down graded and he would get 4 months Four month goes by and out he goes, 2 weeks goes by and since the first home invasion with violence was so much fun, he and his mate gave it another go. As we know everyones favourite little rascal has gutted a mother in front her daughters and husband. Second trial this one for actual murder, life in prison should be on the cards right, no it is not. The YJA still hasnt been changed and everything remains the same. This is the worst crime the judge has ever seen and gives him 8 years, probably out in 5. Who wants to bet that after all the free walks he isnt going to change. This is not trying to rehabilitate violent sociopaths, because you cannot, this is about removing them for as long as possible
57. It won't work. Crime is regional areas has increased. I call Bullshit on the ALP for saying it hasn't. Adult time for adult crime won't fix it. I call Bullshit on the LNP for saying it will.
58. 16 years prison, what offence do you think someone is getting 16 years for?
59. I can not give much more details about this, but... Currently, there is a 13 year old male who has a list of sexual assault crimes he has done to other children. Under current laws, sexual based crimes are only prosecuted if the person is over 18 years old. This 13 year old is not the only one. There are roughly 90 that I am aware of. But they all are not in institutions, nor are they facing any extreme criminal charges.
60. Jail is already a place that churns out criminals. It‚Äôs a business itself. They want them back. Our prisons aren‚Äôt the worst but we don‚Äôt have the resources in place countries like Norway etc do, that try everything to help reformation.
61. We have infrastructure to build, right? It's not about locking them away, it's about rehabilitation. With the exception of things like murder. Just life them. They lost their opportunity to be a functional member of society when they took a life. But steal a car? Look in a victim of this and I have hope. I can replace a car.
62. Even adults shop lift. But that often considered a youth crime issue. I guess the intentions are if someone keeps stealing cars at some point they are going to face an adult type sentencing arrangement with incarceration instead of them simply getting a maximum minor punishment due to being under age. You can see this will create a life time problem for the child, others will be happy they screw up big enough they go to prison for 20 years. I think there is a healthy middle ground between ALP and LNP policies, let's give LNP the chance I guess to see if they can tune it right while also providing suitable rehabilitation to youth offenders. I am a big believer in giving people an opportunity to redeem themselves if they make the right choices with actions to correct their past behaviors. Sometimes people do things out of desperation, i.e. a parent stealing food because they have no money to feed their kids, crime yes, but if they had a job and a steady income likely that person wouldn't have done it.
63. The LNP answer is ‚Äúhow is this worse than the current situation?‚Äù. The kids currently doing breaking and entering and auto theft typically aren‚Äôt going to school and getting qualifications and becoming well adjusted members of society. They already grow up hanging with other criminals, with weak ties to community and outside of normal society. At least in prison they can be forced to engage in education, even if it is out of sheer boredom. It‚Äôs also a pretty serious crime to get you sixteen years actually in prison in Australia. Most of the crimes the LNP is targeting will have significantly shorter sentences.
64. it means when they turn 18 they do adult crime for the stuff they did with labor they get clean sheet
65. Multiple innocent people not victimised over the course of the 16 years ?
66. Really good questions and will be interesting to see how all of this plays out. One thing is for certain though, we can't continue to the home invasions and car theft/joy riding at the rates these little shitbags are. We cannot have people being attacked in their own homes. Hiding weapons in our homes in the chance there is a home invasions is not the answer. All that will happen then is that the kids will carry more weapons and be far more intent on using them if confronted. The parents aren't controlling them, the police aren't allowed to touch them so it now must fall on the courts to apply sufficient penalty to at least get them off the streets and halt the reoffending. How they are rehabilitated after that is also critical, so I'm guessing there'll be plenty of psychological consultation to go along with this program.
67. Don‚Äôt be silly, we‚Äôll send them to work in the mines!
68. This is anecdotal but I know a kid who was constantly on drugs when he was out, stealing cars and constantly getting into fights. He did house invasion and robbery some time ago, people were hurt, he ended up in jail. Later on when I saw him he actually looked good, he had color on his face, he was like; ‚Äúonly time I was actually drug free last few years was when I was in jail‚Ä¶‚Äù I am not saying let‚Äôs lock up every violent youth offender but the trick seems to be to severe their ties with their toxic group that associate with. These kids get bailed for exactly this purpose; courts expect services to reform their lives. Do they do it? I don‚Äôt know, in Victoria lot of DHHS kids are lost cause once they end up in rezicare, the environment there is it‚Äôs no different to jail with hardened older criminal youths leading them, except in jail they can‚Äôt hurt law abiding average Joe who works long hours to look after his family and gets robbed, bashed or stabbed. Come up with an idea where we can reform these kids and I am all for it. But as it is, people are getting hurt. It‚Äôs been a while since I was in Queensland so not sure what‚Äôs it like there now but we went from ‚Äúit‚Äôs just sensationalist media‚Äù to ‚Äúok we have a serious youth issue here‚Äù in Victoria.
69. I don‚Äôt think the plan is to rehabilitate these people.
70. Someone doing time for murder as a 14 year old is probably never going to make a positive contribution to society. So the more time they spend in jail, removed from society, the better.
71. So the 10 year old boys who killed James Bulger in 1993. Should of been sentence to what ? How do you treat Adult Crimes. We are not talking about petty crimes like shop lifting are we. We are talking about crimes that change other peoples lives permanently. If they are that rotten at that age beyond mischief and just naughty they deserve to be in prison they are not be rehabilitated.
72. If they spend 16 years in prison and then decide to reoffend upon getting out we‚Äôll just lock them up for another 16 years. What‚Äôs with the defeatist attitude that because somebody may reoffend we should just give up and not even try to punish them? At least the new system means there‚Äôs a 16 year hiatus between their opportunities to harm innocent people. It sounds good to me
