Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Why not answer the question then instead of pretending you don't understand what racism is?
2. I recommend reading this I read it a few. Days ago and I feel like they have the right idea https://qld.onenation.org.au/issues
3. Call it what you like,I call it having a laugh.
4. Have you looked on a map where labor "safe seats" are located. Might wanna delete that comment.
5. why would you have to go to school when you got everything just handed to you?
6. probably will be somewhat disappointed i imagine, because a lot of people on the left side are expecting a LNP win even though they really don't want it
7. They'll still put legislation in place to axe the 50c fares after they leave government and then blame it on Labor anyway
8. who making the sandwich? the teacher? my regional school I worked at we went shopping once a month as it was 2 hours each way to a supermarket. Luckly most the students were fairly self sufficient with own vege patches, and the yearly butching of their livestock. but yes we should waste money, sending out frozen meals to be store in a freezer as that would be only way to do it. This shows why labor struggle with regional queensland, as they don't understand it. Lunches to these places isn't a simple idea. it's not like the city where you can just get a catering company to make and deliver them. It shows that idea's hadn't been fully considered
9. It’s a good system I think, as long as people know what to do. And you can use it to your advantage. I.e. Greens 1, Labour 2. Greens will not win, labour gets the vote, but they know that green issues are a vote winning platform and might influence policy for next election. My thoughts are correct right?
10. thanks for all your time and effort going into this. right up there with the essential volunteers
11. A lot of people are struggling and they don’t like being told that someone else’s struggle is more important because of skin colour.
12. Queensland doesn't even have particularly bad debt though? Certainly not in comparison to the other states. A lot of the spending outlays were also funded by recapturing part of the profits from our resources. Hell, given that these policies had a tangible effect on people's household finances rather than appealing to a more abstract concept of improved grand scale financial trends, it's probably the thing that lead to it not being the absolute blowout landslide it was predicted to be for the last few months.
13. Check your spam. Were a few in mine I didn't know about.
14. Same. I'm on the do not call list. Id imagine political parties would be one of the few institutions to honour it.
15. >Yes, but the LNP would have to vote when that call is made. Crisafuli gave no clear indication of what he will do, his members have said they'll vote to repeal. He may have said he had no desire to change the laws, but he stopped short of saying he would enforce his members to do the same. He never made it clear that he would not allow a conscious vote. yep if there is a conscience vote (which by all accounts there likely will be because of Katter) and that factions that want to restrict abortion have the numbers to, it will get restricted, i very much doubt Crisafuli would force the party to vote on party lines because it would end up exploding internally and probably spill him
16. You must live in a reddit bubble because Crisafilli clearly said last week they had no plan to change abortion Kids aren't stealing cars by knife point because they are hungry When they rob service stations they aren't raiding the fridge they are targeting cigarettes My son will be at schoolies and he knows to come to me to test his pills.
17. Who are you? A third alt account? Yeah thanks channel 9 news.. I’m aware of what was said. I was literally there. Buzz off.
18. family first would be more likely to vote to remove abortion rights than most minor parties, I feel.
19. [WLSQ](https://wlsq.org.au/get-involved/make-a-donation/#:~:text=WLSQ%20provides%20free%20legal%20and,seeking%20legal%20and%20welfare%20assistance.) seems like they might be busy if the ALP aren’t returned.
20. nah, I just know ETU games and bullshit. Number 1. Not hooking up power to developments unless all private enterprise workers are paid the same as gold plated public service.
21. And had good policy this year like 50c fares, which i fear the LNP will immediately scrap
22. Seems odd to suggest that the majority of Queenslanders don't like women and/or are transphobes but you are entitled to your opinion I guess.
23. 1) so why not demand that of the LNP? Why endorse their lack of a plan? 2) he endorsed I think 48/50. I agree on the Vic plan proposal. That should have been endorsed, but if you're blaming him for wasting money, then surely you should blame LNP for now effectively doing the exact same thing barely hours into their reign. 3) that just reinforces my point. There are people who kill for a voice, a vote. Making voting optional is treating democracy with disdain. Donkey voting does the same. Surely voting and being counted is a stronger message.
24. So glad introducing an ETS fixed carbon emissions in the places that have carbon markets
25. If they need KAP then they don't have a majority, a majority implies they can govern in their own right. As Antony said, they have a pathway to that but it's not a sure thing.
26. Yeah nah I doubt they're more happy when the other side loses than when they win.
27. Is this your first time attempting reading comprehension, champ? Compared to the expected 50+ seat landslide that everyone predicted a few weeks ago, barely scraping across the 47 seats required to form majority is a small margin.
28. The last LNP landslide win was 7 to 78. Given the talk for months, it sure sounded like the expectation was another one of those.
29. You're right, I guess posting something positive about the LNP would prove that it's not an echo chamber and you'd have nothing to cry about anymore. If you care that much about karma on reddit and people calling you stuff on the internet, maybe the internet isn't for you.
30. Yeah I think (not as familiar these days) it took a pretty bad nosedive after the results. But I am guessing that is the parallels the OP was trying to draw
31. But this isn't happening unless there are SEVERE risks to the baby or mother. Another example of fear mongering.
32. I understand what racism is, it was a sarcastic question, but name a single policy of theirs that’s racist, prove its not keywords
33. China and India don’t care about climate change why should we
34. I honestly only quickly skimmed through their policies but there’s nothing really that inspiring or different about their policies. It honestly seemed pretty similar to the LNP with the exception of wanting to change firearm laws.
35. You pay the local bakery to make a bunch of sandwiches. You get a few boxes of apples from a local farmer, milk boxes from the local dairy farm. Money goes to local business, and the kids get fed. It's really not that hard
36. Pretty much yep. If ALP get in on a slim margin with 2nd highest being greens then they know that people generally want policies more aligning with the greens than any other alternative and shows that if they want to keep their seats next time, some more progressive policies would be a good idea.
37. Oh yeah whoever wins the seat will analyse the preference flows to try and find patterns about which issues people care about. If Labor are winning off greens preferences that also tells them that if they abandon progressive voters they'll likely lose that seat.
38. Yes, so ideally, the ballot papers would tell you to number every box, but you vote would still count if you didn't. And campaigns telling you /not/ to number every box would be outlawed as encouraging disenfranchisement or something.
39. Of course, that's not what I'm trying to insinuate. But by the same token, just because you are struggling doesn't give you carte blanche to ignore others' struggles. If you equate person A going hungry with person B getting killed I don't know what to say. We should be helping both, but there is a difference in urgency and impact.
40. It’s not more important because of their skin colour, it is important because it’s genocide. Genocide can happen to any group of people that have been othered. It’s not actually based on skin colour.
41. > Queensland doesn't even have particularly bad debt though? You would have to shut down the state for 2 and a half years to pay off our current debt in full from current revenue. Comparatively NSW would need to shut down for about 13 months to totally pay off theirs. >A lot of the spending outlays were also funded by recapturing part of the profits from our resources. Excellent, and we should have been using that to pay down our debt during a period of inflationary pressure. Noting that government spending is the most substantial inflationary pressure. >Hell, given that these policies had a tangible effect on people's household finances rather than appealing to a more abstract concept of improved grand scale financial trends Inflation has a bigger impact on the average household finance than populist spending sprees. The concept is very easy to demonstrate in simple infographics, videos and other content pieces. There has been intense attention on inflation by the media and general public. Given the ALP commanded a revenue source that the LNP couldn't possibly match (resource taxation), they could have saddled their own government's historic legacy of overspend and debt (much accrued during the pandemic) on the LNP as they would be the only party with a tangible plan to repair it. >it's probably the thing that lead to it not being the absolute blowout landslide it was predicted to be for the last few months. Perhaps it's been the key to turning non-idealogical Greens voters away from the party, but I would guess the LNP's lack of commitment on abortion policy has hindered them more.
42. No, they're one of several institutions which are not required to honour it.
43. I'm on the Do not Call register and still get calls and SMS, as others have advised political parties are specificly exempt from it.
44. > My son will be at schoolies and he knows to come to me to test his pills. Your son is lucky to have a supportive parent. Not all kids have that though and onsite pill testing is the best thing they can have to stay safer at big events like schoolies. I don't fancy reading the news afterwards when it reports on how many kids died due to badly cut drugs that we can't test anymore because the LNP thinks kids deserve to die.
45. >You must live in a reddit bubble because Crisafilli clearly said last week they had no plan to change abortion Yet some of his MPs said the opposite. Freya ostapovitch for one. >Kids aren't stealing cars by knife point because they are hungry >When they rob service stations they aren't raiding the fridge they are targeting cigarettes Kids don't just develop crime tendencies. It stems from systemic dysfunction. Without proper education, they end up resorting to such measures. >My son will be at schoolies and he knows to come to me to test his pills. That's great for him. What about the rest?
46. >Who are you? A third alt account? I'm not sure how to break this news to you but there's more than one person on reddit. Different people have different accounts you see and with the posts and comments being open conversations to anyone on the site, you're bound to have multiple people replying to the same thing. Hope this helps.
47. > Who are you? A third alt account? I am another alt account come to share my story about how I also didn't really like miles during covid but have come around to him since.
48. Is this your first day on Reddit? It’s an open forum, anyone can reply to anyone here mate, it’s not Parliament.
49. Someone forget to give grandpa his meds again, you’re not making any sense mate. No one cares that you’re mad at them for posting their opinion.

52. conservatism? Dude, that guy is going on about fascism and calling people cunts and saying anyone who doesn't vote his way hates women etc etc it's unhinged behaviour that's completely out of touch with reality and largely borne out of spending too much time in an online echo chamber dehumanising people keep going on about "conservatism" but this rhetoric is right here on display for everyone to see i don't need to manufacture a boogie man to make my point it's right there \^
53. Having a degree doesn’t make you more right, or mean that priorities living outside urban centres are somehow inferior to city concerns.
54. 1. The alternative was Miles who rejected the proposal already. As I said, I would have voted for LNP if they came out and backed Vic Park but they didn’t thus I had no candidates I felt I could vote for. Ultimately I left it to the QLD public to decide. 2. I do blame LNP for once again wasting money. As I said in my OP I wished they would start building tomorrow. However, building in 100 days is better than not building at all. 3. If you have the right to vote, you have the right not to vote. No one should be able to force you to vote against your will.
55. Quite high. That's as many times as the entire MCG last year (the most utilised stadium in Australia by a fair way). Grass needs time to grow and it often doesn't get the opportunity. It's not been helped by the Dolphins playing the majority of their games at Suncorp (instead of their local stadium in Redcliffe) and the concert cap at Suncorp has been increased too so it's going to get even worse. We probably don't need all these events to be at Suncorp either. Most Queensland Reds and Roar games def. don't need to be in a 52,000 seater stadium that's 2/3 -3/4 empty but cost those sides an arm and a leg to rent from Stadiums Queensland.
56. And then that changed to neck and neck in the past few days. Now it's a 16 seat difference.
57. Alright, I’ll bite. I’m staunchly against ALP’s plan for the Olympics. Represents terrible value for money and I would prefer any alternative of the Gabba, Victoria park or Hamilton. Libs haven’t committed to anything but I’d rather a chance at something better than the states biggest white elephant ever.
58. *Labour. Oh and you are either incredibly ignorant or incredibly stupid if you don’t think they exacerbated it. You’d be embarrassed to say it wasn’t.
59. Never. But some people think it’s acceptable to have a last trimester abortion. It’s their opinion.
60. ?? [Only fear mongering happening is anyone saying if anything different to the status quo.](https://amp.abc.net.au/article/104506014)
61. China is investing more in renewables than any other country.
62. Be the change you want Think global, act local Leave no trace Whether you choose to ignore the actual science that has been proven correct for the past 30 yr or not, at the end of the day we are talking about forms of pollution, and its embarrassing to invite guests to your home with litter, rubbish and filth lying around. The same principal applies to the land, air and water
63. We should care about climate change because we fucking live here.
64. lol, these are 2021 statistics https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/02/ranked-10-countries-energy-transition-investment/ they very much do care. India is also leading the charge on research into Thorium reactors
65. It’s worse. Under “cost of living” it says: >We will *remove Net Zero regulations* that are strangling our farmers, and in turn driving up the cost of farming while making electricity unaffordable. > >We have led the charge and long advocated for the removal of state government excise on insurance premiums to help with one of the most important costs many families face. We will also *end taxpayers’ subsidies for inefficient and unreliable solar and wind power. New power plants would be built using coal* to meet the rising demand for affordable and reliable power.
66. They also want to restore the upper house I think it’s a good idea and honestly I’m willing to give them a shot Btw sorry I’m not good at explaining stuff I’m not very good at talking to people
67. yes.. because the town that are literally a pub, petrol stations, a school and houses have local bakery. Good lucky finding a local dairy farm. It funny you basically saying the kids aren't getting fed, when regional kids are most likely being fed better than city kids. So you saying regional qlders are neglecting their children?
68. I can only speak to the labor party’s system but I believe if you request not to be called the system will remove your number for 5 years I believe
69. Looking at the results of the official pill testing is actually reassuring with very few ecstasy pills containing adulterants The fear of bunk pills with dangerous cuts seems to have disappeared since the dark net took over. Market pressures has had a positive affect it would seem
70. I'll be surprised if he hasn't spent the last month of swot vac gleaning my prescription stash
71. Not sure why you feel so entitled to talk down to other users. But I guess that’s the kind of person you are 🙄
72. … The only chiming in is everyone having a go at me - which makes a lot more sense if it’s just one person using alt accounts. It doesn’t make sense that this thread keeps getting new views, who are all so sure I’m wrong and deserved to be shit on. That’s not how the reddit app works anyways.. Sorry to edit but mods banned me then muted me. You aren’t allowed to explain your point of view 🙄
73. Reproductive rights are a human right. An attempt to eliminate them is a fascist move, as fascism loves control, and control is authoritarianism. So yes, you're a cunt. any one who votes for the erosion of human rights is a cunt and a fascist. And you wanna wave a flag for dehumanisation? Removing a person's choice is the ultimate dehumanising thing you can do. You're a bloke who won't get pregnant, won't have your body wrecked from it. Won't face risk of death, won't be forced to carry a child you don't want. All you fascist fucks are the same, can't see past your dick.
74. 1. There are more than 2 parties in Australia. 2. They pride themselves on being the "best fiscal managers", yet they are literally fucking around with the money before they even get in. By the time they've finished with all their spending where do you think the money comes from to build the stadium? Keep an eye out on cuts. They're going to start by scrapping the mining royalties. 3. It's not about forcing someone to vote. It's a lament on the foolhardy nature with which countries value their democracy. Anyway, I'm sure this discussion can go on forever. I'm exhausted. Today my state told me they don't value the sanctity of my female friends, and that my very being holds little value. Have a good evening!
75. Instead of talking about winning all you did was troll ALP supporters. I'm not wrong.
76. So it changed at the last moment after a lot of the votes had already been cast? I don't know, maybe it's because I've watched months of doomposting about the incoming ALP wipeout but this really doesn't seem like a surprising result.
77. We asked for something positive about the LNP. It's good they don't have a plan? Also I think you'll find the Olympics being a massive waste of money is a very popular position in the echo chamber.
78. https://queenslandlabor.org/ They adopted the US spelling to differentiate themselves from UK *Labour. Now about the "incredibly stupid" comment. Would you like to back track some?
79. It's all or nothing though isn't it. Conservatives want it banned completely many even in instances of rape as per the USA. That's what we're fighting
80. Do you understand what a conscience vote is? Crisafulli's personal stance is irrelevant.
81. Well if a town only has a pub and a petrol station, how many primary school kids are attending the school? That makes it even easier, you give the school a budget and get the staff to organise it themselves. You're looking for an obstacle when it's not there
82. Neither my wife or I have received a single political ad SMS or call either. We are on the do not call registry.
83. Pill testing is still something that saves lives and doesn't cost a lot to implement. Even if it only saves 1 life it's still worth it. You'd think the party of 'family values' and supposedly caring about kids would want kids to be protected more.
84. No one was pretending to be the OP, they were just chiming in. And the person who was originally asked can still answer if they wanted, you don’t seem to understand how this website works. No one was locked out of replying to a comment just because someone else did it first. Why has this upset you so much?
85. you are just copying and pasting hyperbolic talking points that aren't based in any reality mate, no major party in queensland has abortion on their platform, no one is coming after reproductive rights and if they did it would stand no chance in the parliament People who disagree with things you say aren't automatically "fascists" again you just sound extremely online and divorced from reality, go for a walk friend get some air
86. Look at the the comments of the past couple of months.
87. The plan is a 100 day review but sure whatever narrative suits you 👍
88. Yeah exactly. Confirms the stupidity. Australians thinking they are American. I’m well aware what they call themselves, doesn’t mean it’s not how it is spelt in Australian English.
89. But that’s not what it’s about here is it. You know that, we know that. Fear mongering if you even remotely distribute that.
90. Oh for sure, I have been a tester at doors and festivals for 30 yr. As a stand alone election policy to decide who gets into power I accept it a minor policy lost.
91. In fact this is your first comment reply in r/Brisbane in over a year and you specifically come all the way down this thread to tell me “take the L” like some kind of forrnite 12 year old. That’s really sus. I bet I’ll get an interesting result if I pull a report on every different account used to send me a one off reply to this thread. It’s way too coordinated to be incidental.
92. Another random account joining in? I can barely find my replies thread since all my responses are kindly buried in down votes … how the hell are you so far down the thread just to bully me and why?? What’s this mess to you?
93. are you somehow new? do you not understand political parties enact change that aren't on their promised political platform? we all know a LNP government will attempt an overturn of abortion rights. i specifically hightlighted that singular point. there is many, and much more damaging policies they will enact if they govern. you do understand how the westminster political system works right? a majority government with sufficient votes can will enact change. fascists never do like being spotlighted, just like crisaufulli couldn't engage with a women over bodily automy, instead othering her. you don't like being ascribed? i wonder why that is?
94. But you didn't say anything about that. You wrote about the Olympics. Also, if there's no plan what will they review?
95. It actually does considering it's a title/name. Anyway I don't think you have the prerequisites for this discussion. Jog on
96. you’re right, these are all my alts, couldn’t be that people think you’re a twat
97. try not being such a prick to people and you might find that people aren’t so quick to call you out on it /2c
98. Probably review the plan the ALP did and then subsequently ignored and pushed ahead with QSAC
99. Correct. For this conversation to continue, I think my IQ would need to be sub 90, maybe sub 80. So yeah you’re right, I don’t have the prerequisites.
100. I feel they could have done that already and formed their own policy.
101. Yep agree, they could have and should have. But I’d still take a chance at a better option than the ALPs commitment to QSAC IMO
102. It would have been nice to see more of this kind of pushback against the youth crime narrative earlier than the last possible minute before the election.
