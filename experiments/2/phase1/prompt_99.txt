Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. I’m 41 & have lived here my whole life. It’s changed so much but I can’t imagine living anywhere else. I grew up in Southport, spent a couple years in Nerang, Mudgeeraba & Bonogin. Also about 6 months living at Nobbys beach. I’m now settled at Helensvale & have lived here for 15 years. Whenever I catch tram into town as in Surfers or via Southport it’s just an eye opener, to how little it represents of the community I gre up in.
2. There’s a lot of crime everywhere now it seems. Still a big party culture. Still has the Gold Coast charm of gym dudes on steroids and tattoos, girls with injectable’s and implants. There’s beautiful people here too of course. The homelessness is getting worse as is ice use amongst all ages. I want to move away after living here my whole life and now having a daughter, to where though I am unsure..
3. As someone when has lived on the GC and then moved back home to the Hunter… all I can say is all that glitters is not gold. I go back every year and see that each and every year it is becoming a loony bin. There is no way I would want my child to grow up in a environment where “Plastic Fantastic” rules the roost and the constant traffic, lack of housing and the general riff raff is worse than what it was when I left in 2017
4. IMO Southern Goldie is tops. Anything north of Burleigh, perhaps even Palm Beach is unviable thanks to traffic and high density. I work from home for an American company, so can’t comment on career options here. Access to nature (beaches and mountains) is IMO what makes or breaks a place for me.
5. Yes getting busier but that’s just the natural trajectory of any smaller city with a steadily growing economy and population. I honestly love the growth and direction of the city. Lived here during the 90’s, left during the 00’s overseas and came back in the last 10 years. Feel very lucky to be here during this time of growth. Gold Coast is so beautiful but depends what you want to get out of it.
6. As much as they try the eshay vibe can't destroy the beach
7. The influx of people and traffic also means that it's now practically impossible to park at a beach. There's also no parking at the light rail stations. So unless you live within walking distance of a beach or a station, good luck getting there without pulling your hair out.
8. We moved here in 2011 and like anywhere there is good and bad. The traffic has become a lot worse but may improve when the light rail and M1 roadworks are completed. If you need to commute to Brisbane the train is the way to go especially with the current 50c fares. The hinterland and beaches are beautiful but good luck getting a carpark at the beach. We moved from Currumbin Waters to Robina and love it here away from the craziness of all the tourists. It's also great for shops, public transport and schools. It all depends on what you are looking for. The weather is great for outdoor activities but we sometimes miss all the cultural events found in a big city. The ever growing population will continue to put a strain on infrastructure, buying and renting is very expensive and crime is an issue like everywhere else. I hope you manage to make a decision that suits your family circumstances.
9. I moved here in 2014. Two small kids and a business. It's been pretty good. I got a waterfront property before the boom. We have a lot of fun fishing and skiing. I work from home, so get to avoid traffic. I would not drive to Brissy. I would use the train. Overall it's good if you have substantial capital to make the move. The units are expensive. Have a really good look around on a holiday. That's what I did. Best of luck.
10. I’m on the northern end in a beachside suburb and it’s great , close to schools , shops Restaurants etc , have been on the Gold Coast for about 25yrs and it definitely has changed particularly population growth has exploded since covid causing a bit of a housing and traffic mess but being a homeowner and also only having a short commute for work means these things don’t really affect me and I can definitely say that the northern suburbs that are on the water don’t have the traffic and population issues that anywhere south of mermaid now do
11. moved to GC back in 2010, sold a house in Sydney and took a big pay cut and had to commute to Brisbane for like 4 yrs. Certainly more jobs now (I work in IT) but pay still lags compared to Brisbane. I decided to take paycut and work in GC as commute was too much, but 1 yr ago found a full time remote work, so happy with that. I have two teenage kids, there are certainly bad influenced kids in any areas, they're telling me how there are stupid/crazy kids in their high school, so it all depends on who you hang out with. Check Seek and see what jobs are around, I joke to my buddies in sydney that move to GC was a carrier suicide, but everyone values different things. I certainly appreciate warmer weather and less crowed people. Unless you're a single income (who is these days) changing two careers at the same time is a huge challenge. housing price has sky rocketed as bad as Sydney, and rent is not good either. I love living in GC, but thats because I have decent job and a small mortgage that is not killing me at 6.2% rate im paying.
12. 30+ years on the GC. M1 is a fucking joke, aside from that it's still not too bad
13. I only been here for 8 years. 4 years ago I moved to Perth for 2 years then come back. 1. Depends on your occupation, maybe GC is mainly tradies and hospitality but both are very seasonal. My partner works in IT (support/networking), he doesn't find it hard to find a job. 2. Public transport still bad as in not really reliable except for trams. I drive now, but travel takes longer bcs roadworks down south 3. House price are crazy, rent are hard to get 4. I love the laid back feeling in GC. I am not into big city like sydney or melb. Brisbane and Perth are big enough for me. 5. Compare to Perth, I prefer the GC because the weather here just *chef kiss*. I am from Bali, so here feels like home. 6. GC airport starting to expand, I expect to see more int'l direct flights 🙏 7. I am afraid of teenager here. I had 2 bad encounters with them, but worked with one like couple years ago, but she was amazing. So, really depends on school and parenting, i guess? - the one I worked with went to one of the best school in GC. Thats from perspective of someone who moved here, left, then moved back 😁👍
14. It's got worse.im so old I remember the zoo behind cavillles surfers paradise hotel.i grew up at tweed heads but always lived in Brisbane. SP used to have the ambiance of double bay Sydney or Monte Carlo but asphalt car parks high rise they threw the baby out with the bath water.it was the holiday destination for graziers between 40's 60"s probably bc of TSS who were knee deep in cash (wool lb/pound)have gone.driving thru SP & getting Chinese at the Chinese restaurant opposite where the chevron hotel was .my father said it wouldn't last.it has but at a cost.walking out of the SP hotel beer garden up Elkhorn av to the beach What delicious memories
15. Born and raised on the GC but moved back and forth a lot as an adult (which is good to compare the gold coast 1-2 years apart multiple times) I'd say, if you were to aggregate the opinions of locals and asked better or worse -- the older generation would be overwhelmingly negative, the younger ones probably somewhere between the same to slightly worse Travelling to Brisbane is still a "thing" but rarely works for long due to the huge cost and time sink - I wouldn't count on it. Fortunately, I would say job opportunities are perhaps more diverse and there are some more sophisticated opportunities now vs before - which is perhaps a nice bonus The lifestyle is much the same in essence, although it's far more expensive to maintain the same convenience as 10-15 years ago without paying substantially more ... If you're happy to bus to the beach or whatever, it's probably just the same as ever In terms of the school and youth culture -- been out of school 15 years but a few friends with younger siblings (subjectively, of course) report that private schools have fast become more snobby but the public schools (once again, varies a lot from generation or school) said they'd gotten slightly better Drug and alcohol use seems high among kids but you'd really need to see if it's any lower anywhere else in Australia for context (in my opinion, which is not really deep here anymore) but drugs were always popular when I was younger and use was widespread although rarely with as much violence as these days Personally, it's very contingent on the crowd you're with ... I might have gotten lucky or some others just unlucky, hard to say... I think it's hard but possible to do "better" than the GC in theory, but it would be very easy to do a whole lot worse
16. It’s where the action is. Great if you are young and outgoing. I’m not sure about raising a family there but it can be done. It’s pricey now too
17. My parents just visited from the UK, took them all over, hinterlands, Byron, whale watching, national park at Burleigh, beach swims, they loved it. Have gone back to grey miserable dark shit.
18. worse more work. more dropkicks more trash culture lifestyle worse (people) still sunny
19. Gold Coast council have a projection of an added 199 thousand homes before 2042 and an extra 900 thousand people. Wild. Strap yourselves in it’s only going to get worse.
20. The ladies wear heaps less at the beach during the summer and same at night on the town
21. Worse, but still better than the favelas of Brazil or the ghettos of India. Party capital, drugs drugs drugs. Need coke? Molly, ice, Frank, shit anything you want you can get here. It's fucked, everyone's on drugs and pretending it's OK. Those that can't see it must have rose coloured glasses or be so naive its not funny. People are getting stabbed and shot more regularly - drug dealer problems etc. Cops are even more dodgy and corrupt. Just seem to ignore crime and hand out traffic infringements to raise revenue for the state government after they figured they couldn't afford the Olympics. Cameras being installed every fucking corner but not for solving crime!? Infrastructure is still 20 years behind what it should be. A 20 min drive now takes an hour. Be lucky to find a park near a beach at all any day of the week. The federal government increased immigration to hide gdp figures and fucked the housing sector. Used unskilled migrants and now houses built post covid are all fcked and should be knocked down. I don't know anyone I grew up with that isn't either a meth addict or a drug dealer or a career criminal. They lied, crime pays, it pays so much fckn better than being a slave. And there's plenty having a crack at the cherry in south east qld.
22. Just a tip, When you ask any group of people who have lived in any town in the developed world whether things have gotten better or worse over the years, the answer will always be worse. Not because things are actually any worse, but because our level of awareness of antisocial fuckwittery increases with age and our tolerance level of it decreases at the same rate, especially once you have kids of your own.
23. More traffic. That's about it. I mean technology keeps advancing but this cultural black hole hasn't changed socio-economically my entire life.
24. One of your points is why I hate it. If you’re not driving in fake tan, living in the gym, flashing your fake too big for your mouth and could blind you teeth, and living on a diet of diet pills, steroids and party drugs then you don’t really fit in anywhere if you’re under 45
25. I think you already know that the GC is a pretty boring place to live full time. Remember driving up and down the M1 and GC hwy looking for something to do? Beach, sports oval, mall, repeat. People are friendly but they’re not interested in anything except their local group, trade work, sports, petty investment, schools. To be fair, this describes most (all) of Australia, but GC feels even more aimless.
26. I’m from there too, grew up in the ‘80’s but wondered about moving back. Most of the family are there, and my parents are getting old. I’ve been in Brisbane for 25 years but I’m in the process of changing career to something less capital city based. The locality stuff above rings true, and Southport and surrounds have always been pretty rough! Not changed then 😂 The house prices might be an issue though 😳
27. The best thing about GC is you get to pick your lifestyle. If you want laidback beach / surf culture, go south. If you want boats, fishing and golf, go north, if you want hustle and bustle, restaurants, cafes and shopping, go central. If you want horses, acreage, rainforest, hikes and mountain biking, go west. If you want to get a bunch of mismatched face tatts, lose most of yor teeth and have screaming fights with your equally battered looking girlfriend in the middl of a crowded shopping center at lunchtime because neither of you have slept for 5 days, go to Southport.
28. Agreed, I've lived here for 25+ years and I prefer it over big cities like Melbourne or Sydney.
29. I went to st Michael’s too, I’m 39 so you must have been a year up from me haha, thanks for the comment.
30. There are definitely more opportunities than there were 20 years ago, but that being said, it really does depend on who your kids hang around with. Also, Brisbane has come a hell of a long way in the last 20 years and is commuting distance away, so it's not like living up in Townsville or something where moving to get a job means leaving everything, setting up from scratch in a new city and having to use your holiday time if you want to see your family and friends.
31. The main thing to consider with Gold Coast is what area can you afford to buy into, because honestly, if you can only get something in one of the endles suburbias on the western side of the M1, like Pacific Pines, and you have to commute to Brisbane rather than work in GC, do yourself a favour, buy in Brisbane and commute to the beach on weekends instead of the other way around. I have a friend who bought in Pac Pines because his wife really wanted to live in Gold Coast, he has a 3 hour round trip commute 5 days a week and on weekends he has to work around the yard, because there's no time during the week, so once he's done with that he just wants to rest. They get to the beach or drive ito surfers / Broady once a month if that and he doesn't get much time with his kid. Can't help thinking they could have bought into Kelvin Grove or Toowoong for a similar price at the time, he would have had a 20 minute run into work if that, they could have gone into the city or Southbank on a whim without having to drive and could still drive to the beach once a month. People get too hooked on the idea of the "Gold Coast Lifestyle" without realizing it costs extra.
32. I live in Tugun and going to the beach is never a hassle... Even to Cooly
33. Depends where you live. Some areas are great for kids.
34. I live just on the NSW side of the border north of the Tweed river and I don’t even like going to Elanora. Fuck the traffic.
35. House is on the market and I'm ready to run...
36. I lived and worked in Surfers and then Runaway bay for 10 years. If you can get a good job or business in GC, then it's an awesome place to live, one of the best in my book, but if you have to commute to Brissy or live way out in the north western suburbia, you're better off to just live in Brisbane where you have the option to get around without a car and then drive to GC any time you want to go to the beach.
37. Big Chiefs!! There’s still a dodgy one in Cooly. I used to ride my 125cc dirt bike through varsity swamp, now it’s a fucking community
38. Classic water rock ball! I’m not actually sure if that’s still there but Robina town centre has changed dramatically! I haven’t been there for ages but pretty sure it was all mostly undercover when I last was there.
39. It’s ok, the LNP are in power now, they said they’d fix crime 😏
40. Probem with Sunny Coast is the distances you have to drive to get around, you spend half your life in the car. Goldy is more condensed, traffic sucks but the distances are lees and Sunny Coast is catching up fast with the traffic congestion.
41. What was the community like when you grew up in Southport v now
42. Sorry I edited because stupid me said I grew up in Helensvale which I did not.
43. Just wondering, are the people who say the Gold Coast is “plastic” or “fake” just going off the general Surfers Paradise area? Because the rest of the Gold Coast isn’t “fake” or “plastic”
44. Sample experience. Mcdonalds "table service" order placed. Staff visually all stressed, pack order in paper bag ignoring table service. Items missing. Ask junior staff for missing item & put receipt on counter to show them. She mishears & thinks I want her to keep the receipt. Freezes solid & asks me to please keep the receipt. Repeat the request again. She then says "it's in the bag". Ask her to check. She checks & realises it's not. Face turns bright red, goes back to kitchen & returns with item and "Have a good one"
45. How is southport as expensive as it is given the reputation it has
46. Twenty years ago, the only place to eat after hours was the casino restaurant, Melbas and I think one 24 hour Maccas just opened up. Yes, GC isn’t on the level of other capital cities but there has been quite a revival starting 10 years ago. There’s like 5 Korean fried chicken stores to choose from. Chinese like you mentioned. Loads of excellent small bakeries and good coffee. Tons of fine dining places that weren’t here before. Definitely a big improvement since back then
47. Yep, couldn't agree more. My friends were/are good people, they just weren't good for me. I'm still friends with all of them and they are the best, now. They've all grown up and made something of themselves too. Many did that without ever leaving the GC I think that the key to good decisions is introspection and reflection.
48. True! Ive just had mates move away with their families up to Hervey Bay, regional or 1770 and seems to be a better lifestyle for raising families now! Just their opinion and experiences I guess 🥰
49. Is the Big Chiefs in Southport still there? That, Wahoo's and that carribean roti place in Mermaid were my favorite 1990's post beach / pre beer "I suppose we should eat something, but I'm not getting changed first" venues.
50. The ball is still there, but no water and doesn’t move anymore. Just sits and bakes in the sun all day.
51. Best people too, my car broke down once with me and my 4 year old daughter stuck by the side of the road in the middle of nowhere, peak summer waiting for a taxi that probably still hasn't arrived. The female owner pulled up in the delivery car, asked if we were okay, gave my daughter a cold bottle of water and went out of her way to drive us home. Flat out refused payment when I tried to give her money. It's been my go-to pizza ever since.
52. So nice, we knew our neighbours & there was a local corner shop we used to go to all the time, it also had a hairdresser which we all had our hair cut at , & a barber where my grandad went. We rode our bikes everywhere & it was safe. No homeless people, no drug addicts, just a normal society.
53. Completely agree. It's an annoying stereotype that is far from an accurate depiction of the majority of the Coast.
54. You don’t get out much if you think it’s only surfers. Every single one of the suburbs along the water is full of them. Burleigh is full of them especially
55. Southport police station is the main station for parolees to do their required check in's and the main centrelink office is just down the road, if they move those 2 buildings somewhere else, Southport will become a totally different place almost immediately. You might even get a vibrant Melbourne style restaurant and bar culture opening up there. Right now it's the fancy new buildings themselves as well as the promise of that bright, crackhead free future that people are payng the premium prices for.
56. It's just the polish being applied lately. It's still a hostile place to live, but I find that charming. New residents seem to move as quickly as they arrive.
57. "No homeless people, no drug addicts, just a normal society." You could apply this to every regional city in Australia before the bikies discovered that meth creates much more loyal and regular customers than plain old speed used to.
58. Yep, along the coast and also people in properties on the edges of the canals. It’s all plastic. Anyone who thinks it’s not either doesn’t get out much or does it with blinders on
59. I have a canal house, what's so plastic about wanting to paddle my kayak before work in the morning? Most of my neighbours are either proffesionals with kids or retirees who bought in the 90's. I'd say there's more implanted titanium than there is plastic. The plastic people generally live in units in Surfers / Broadbeach, with a few wannabe plastic people who post instagram videos from the beach or the cafe every morning but drive in from Coombabah to take them.
60. I’d love you to point out exactly where *anyone* has said specifically that every single person in waterside homes fits into the plastic demographic. You won’t find it. There being high numbers of that type who tend to congregate in certain areas doesn’t make every single person that way
61. properties on the edges of the canals. It’s all plastic Your words champ.
62. And yet none of those words say every single person…
63. So what does "all" mean? maybe youmeant to say most, or some?
64. There's new housing being built everywhere on the Gold Coast so there is no excuse for homelessness. Most new apartments are starting from as little as $2.3 million, so it's not like they're unaffordable!
65. Yeah that’s just a flat out assault. I’m currently homeless and would never do something so crazy. You’d assume it’s drugs so I I’d report the assault to the police. Have a great weekend.
66. That is assault - did you bother to report it ?
67. As much as it sucks to say, but you have to call Crimestoppers or similar and at least report it. A lot of homelessness is due to poor mental health (amongst other factors) and by calling Crimestoppers, opposed to the police directly, they may get some actual help.
68. This is disgusting, I’m so sorry to hear this happened to you and your family. Burleigh needs a police presence and station, long overdue. Was the guy short, wearing army pants with a buzz cut?
69. gold coast was always going this way. its economics doesnt make any sense.
70. I’d call the police. Spitting is a big no no. It’s considered a serious assault.
71. I agree. I want to feel safe in my city. Recently a foreign man was touching himself on the train at 6 pm. It was beyond gross.
72. We had this issue up in broadbeach. Unfortunately we had multiple issues with assault with one person and it was escalated right up to the police minister, council and government. He has been moved on now. It was very scary and we considered moving over it. Feel so much safer now.
