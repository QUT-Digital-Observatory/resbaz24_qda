Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. The argument is that it naturally causes a partial slow down of mining activity, which makes sense. So if there was less super-profit's tax on mines, there would be a lower 'cut off' for what is economically viable, and an increase in economic activity from the mines. So the taxes cause a partial slow down of economic activity in places like Mackay, and the taxes are reabsorbed into the state to fund programs overwhelming outside of Mackay (by natural consequence of Mackay being a place of 80,000 people out of 4,500,000 s) . So an average person in Mackay thinks they'll be better off with a $120,000+ mining job, as compared to a $1000 energy rebate or 50c fare, and you cant blame them. If the federal government absorbed Queensland Mining profits and re-directed them to Sydney and Melbourne I would be livid. I obviously think we are better off with the taxes than without them, but you can see why the regions overwhelming voted LNP.
2. Because the miners aren‚Äôt investing in QLD anymore. Don‚Äôt eat the hand that feeds you or something like that ‚Ä¶
3. Yeah I think it will be a relatively benign first term in the hope of getting a second. Last night I was more worried that they wouldn't form majority. I think a minority government needing Katters help would have been a problem. I shall remain optimistic that they will indeed do well on the things they campaigned on.
4. Its my speculation. Pretty much all consensus from scientific bodies including the governments own is that it will be the most expensive form of power and take decades to implement. What excites you about slowly getting higher power bills at the expense of cheaper green energy projects that we could build now instead?
5. The problem is, in Queensland, if you have a majority that's it, you can do what you want. Especially the LNP who will be given a free hand by the media. But at minimum we'll see mining royalties scraped, so the fat fucks like Clive and Gina can crow about making a little more money for the next for years.
6. Yeah nah, my monies on its gonna be a Newman 2.0 but worse cus he will make add on making abortion harder for women. He's gonna axe the mining tax guaranteed, just check out how much in bribes he got from mining companies. It's right there for the public to see, and will have to recoup that dosh somehow. Added if he decides to keep the 50c fares. Which I highly doubt, cus how's he gonna keep it with no royalties coming in? Unless he slashes gov jobs across the board. It's literally all LNP knows. Oh, and that abortion thing will play out exactly as most people speculated. Mad hatter will put it up, cus he loves causing trouble, and lnp will vote it in according to party lines (ahem conscious vote lmao). On top of ALL that, this is a man known for ruining a business and trading while insolvent AND paying people off to shut up about the details.. This is all known facts. Yeah qlds proper fucked until someone else gets in.
7. Of course he's not going to blood-let like Newman did, the LNP would have learnt that it's political suicide. And I don't know if you've noticed, but politicians like to be in power, not sitting on the sidelines for decades.
8. It doesn‚Äôt have to be corruption. Swinging mining royalties back towards mining companies instead of the people is an example. Everyone should benefit from the cool rocks we have in the ground.
9. Haven‚Äôt the last lot being giving it out to energy retailers under the guise of ‚Äúcost of living ease‚Äù.
10. Can confirm, am in cage. Told I'll be on a jetstar flight out of here in no time...
11. Fed Labor just moved legislation to ensure the NBN wasn't privatised ... So I guess not .

13. You kinda miss my point. The point I'm making is, whether LNP or Labor, 80% of the policy choices will be similar because they're both influenced by the same corporates, the same vested interests. They're not actually interested in rocking the boat because they want to continue appealing to the mass majority and both parties are hunting for the elusive 'centrist swing voter'. If One Nation, the Greens or whoever else had won the election, we could expect more seismic shifts over the next 4 years.
14. can you help and share your opinion too, so people can gauge more than seemingly one side? I'm positive the more information the better for people reading and not posting ü§ó
15. So, permanent residents can vote in federal elections, but not in state?
16. What part of my comment was wrong? That Labor have zero plan to timeline to extend the rail line to Coolangatta, or LNP have said they plan to extend the Sunshine Coast to Mooloolaba and not stop it at Caloundra, like Labor intend? Have your even read SEQ2031, Labor have failed to deliver/plan/fund 90% of the rail projects they identified as necessary for Brisbane in 2031‚Ä¶
17. People have such short memories. Queensland was such a backwards place under Joh and it's scary AF that we could head back that way.
18. But they can't be bribing them more than they will lose from the lack of royalties
19. Simply not true. If we have profitable minerals, they will mine them. The coming decade, I think, will not be all roses for mining and it will have nothing to do with the royalties and everything to do with the world's economy and economics and a particular deposit.
20. That would be true if for only one assumption: That the LNP are smart and know how learn from their mistakes. Conservatism, by its nature, doesn't evolve. Get the scissors out
21. Mining royalties is a large discussion to be had, but I don't think labor is immune in this discussion either
22. Add Paladin group to every other poor value for money contractor the government employs. A problem that's rife in both LNP and Labor governments. Bit of unbias analysis please
23. Don‚Äôt worry, that‚Äôs what Jetstar always say but you‚Äôll be waiting for hours.
24. My opinion on a change of government? It's listed above - nothing significant, nothing fast. However, this time the party leader has said that each portfolio minister will have a clear goal and will earn their stripes inside and outside the party. His role included. This is, in my opinion, fresh, sensible, and, incredibly new to modern politics. I'm hopeful.
25. You could argue that normal prices aren't sustainable also. They all lose money. The same argument could be made for roads, schools, hospitals. But guess what. That is why governments exist. To provide public services. They aren't supposed to make money.
26. Can‚Äôt even vote in federal elections as a permanent resident if you arrived in Australia after 1984. Must be a citizen.
27. I can‚Äôt even vote in a council election despite being a rate payer.
28. 2031 is 6 years away for a start, and how will the Liberals do it? They lie through their teeth. They‚Äôre getting rid of coal royalties so there won‚Äôt be enough money for it so how will they pay for it? They‚Äôll cut the public sector so how will they build it?
29. Bribes go to the party, not to the state coffers, so it's a net win for LNP to take the bribe
30. Wrong. Mining is a risky and volatile business especially coal. The investment thesis is stacked on the idea that temporary super profits will outweigh the bad times. Then you have a Peter Pan like demagogue running the state backed by an army of uneducated redditor voters who are happy to cut out the super profits.
31. It hasn't happened yet mate. But any number of dodgy dealing under previous Liberal governments both state and federal. How quickly you seem to have forgotten.
32. Imagine communicating in Trump gifs and expecting anyone to take your political perspective seriously.
33. Changes to sentencing laws for youth offenders will be swift, everything else will be slow.
34. 6 years away for start and then build? Lol no absolutely not‚Ä¶ not at the rate it gets built in Queensland Labor have even said that they can‚Äôt build a rail line all the way to Maloolaba by 2032, not enough time. NWTC has been scrapped for a Gympie Road Toll Tunnel. Brisbane East - West subway scrapped. No timeline on Springfield or Gold Coast line extensions Network segmentation won‚Äôt happen now, quadruplication of key tracks is off the table all together. And finally they‚Äôve also said the Beaudesert Line will now be postponed until the 2030s at earliest.
35. Plus probable personal gains for the LNP politicians involved via high paid cushy exec roles in mining companies post politics.
36. Countries like middle eastern nations that keep a huge margin via resource royalties beg to differ. The nation is rich, and companies like Royal Dutch Shell, British Petroleum, and Chevron still profit. There is absolutely no evidence that supports your claim, it is disinformation peddled by miners that want taxes gone, and nothing else. The person I replied to is an LNP shill through and through, that gives no fucks about Queenslanders. Blocked.
37. Yes and there‚Äôs never been any evidence of Labor dodgy deals. But don‚Äôt mention those here.
38. So the other guy can make wrong accusations without any counter points and that doesn't get criticised? Weird standard
39. I said 2031 is six years away, you seem to think it‚Äôs already passed going on about how they haven‚Äôt done what they said they would do by 2031. Also most of those projects never left the ‚Äúconcepts of a plan‚Äù stage so that‚Äôs arguably better than promising them and having to retract. Rail takes centuries to get any funding and the Inlander was never going to be completed this decade either. Yes it‚Äôs shit that things get postponed or cancelled but under the LNP none of it would even happen. Late is better than never
40. Wrong. Contradictory. You say miners mine where profitable Recognise that a tax eats into profit Claim this doesn‚Äôt have an impact on investment Failed logic.
41. Sure thing. Remember when ol' Gladys gave away millions of public money to her boyfriends shooting club? Or when Scomo gave a boat company millions for dodgy boats to help prop up their share price? Or giving millions to a woefully incapable Paladin to run a concentration camp on Manus? Or when they give News Corp money for seemingly no reason at all? (this one happens a bit)
42. Ugh‚Ä¶ the window to begin major infrastructure projects like NWTC has absolutely passed if it were to be built by 2031 or even 2032.. it would have needed a funding commitment back in 2022, but it never came about‚Ä¶ Fact is 90% of those major rail projects determined necessary for SEQ by 2031 won‚Äôt be built, or have been scrapped. At least LNP have committed to extending the Sunshine Coast to Mooloolaba, when Labor said they couldn‚Äôt do it.
43. No, I‚Äôm right. You are wrong. The failed logic is yours. They can still be profitable - and are - even while paying taxes.
44. None of these were ever to the level of corruption or misappropriated funds, which is what your comment was inferring. I'm not a die hard LNP supporter and I frequently vote against them but I won't buy into your hysteria that money just flows to private hands without due process. Even Labor has done it (and a few have been convicted of it as well). The government has and always will twist the bureaucracy to their favourable choice but most of it definitely does not constitute corruption. P.s the government didn't just give money to newscorp, it had to pay out a tax rebate of nearly a billion dollars and the court of appeals overruled an appeal by the federal government. If you're talking about the $900million payout.
45. This wasn't even investigated by the CCC, and they have a low bar to investigate.
46. The LNP also can‚Äôt do it is what I‚Äôm saying
47. Imagine thinking taxes on profits don‚Äôt impact profits Your head is in the sand sir
48. So it's not dodgy? From The Australian: > David Crisafulli secured a taxpayer-funded $321,600 grant when he was a Newman government minister for a call centre to be set up in Townsville by an LNP donor who gave him a job when he lost his seat six months later.
49. Can‚Äôt build the rail line to Mooloolaba? Yeah I agree on some of the projects, LNP can‚Äôt deliver them by 2031 because too much time has been lost.
50. No, it is not. You are still wrong. Imagine thinking the state and its people should not benefit from the state's resources. Fuck off, capitalist fascist.
51. You seem to think I'm a die hard LNP supporter that defends everything they do. Well I'm not, I frequently vote against them but that doesn't mean I'll buy into the hysteria OP is on about that they just "hand money to the private industry". This is corruption plain and simple , and whilst I think Crisafulli secured favourable terms for this call centre grant, I don't in any way, think it's corruption and neither does the CCC. The grant was done in due process with the respective department. Is it dodgey? Maybe. Is it favourable and unfair? Probably. Is it corruption ? Definitely not. But this is how politics is played on both sides.
52. Even if we had 20 years the LNP would scrap them, even if we had a budget surplus. A budget surplus for the LNP just means they didn‚Äôt give enough money to Gina, property developers, and their friends - it doesn‚Äôt mean they now have a chance to do public works
53. Actually, that incident is very much the definition of corrupt. He utilised his power for personal gain. Much like he did by getting the tax payers paying for his rent in Brisbane despite him already having property in Brisbane.
54. Corruption is a criminal offence. If it's so obvious that a Reddit bush lawyer like you could prove it, why wasn't he convicted? Or better yet, he wasn't even investigated. Are you saying the public prosecution are so incompetent they couldn't prove corruption from a simple google search that you did? Why are you on Reddit and not heading up the CCC if proving corruption is so easy
55. Ffs that‚Äôs not the point of why I said that and you know it
56. Congratulations. You are finally experiencing corruption. If your naivety wasn't so strong, you'd understand it. This is how corruption works. Using power to your advantage.
57. What a nonsensical response to not understanding that corruption is a crime that Crisafulli has not been convicted of.
58. A politician getting away with corruption. You have to be really naive if you think corruption does not exist in the political sphere, and quite clearly this is a conversation that no one will get you to realise that. The LNP has a history of corruption. Getting away with it, is a form of corruption. The fact they haven't been arrested is evidence of corruption. Anyway, don't think you get that. Have a good day!
59. By this guys logic if you go above the speed limit while driving it's not speeding unless you get caught and convicted. Naive doesn't begin to cut it. Ignorant buffoonery would be a better description.
60. I'm not denying the existence of corruption on both sides but politicians are highly scrutinised in their decisions. They have multiple people trying to catch them out, including the opposition. This case has obviously been looked at and not even qualified to be looked at as possibly corruption. Not even Labor called for it to be referred to the CCC. What does that tell you? it's most probably not a crime, or the whole government, including Labor themselves are colluding with LNP in corruption. So I say again, are you a better lawyer than the CCC, who didn't bother to investigate because they saw nothing in it?
61. Dumb analogy but I'll play along. If you speed past multiple speed cameras and police officers checking speed and nothing happens not even a flash by the cameras, were you speeding? You've gone through multiple checks and none picked you up, so what does that tell you? Is the whole system just corrupt or did you maybe not speed at all.
62. Hence the dumb premise of this analogy. Corruption isn't a standard unit of measurement. But I guess you could critically analyse that.
63. I mean, you know, people are entitled to their sexual proclivities. Let there be a thousand blossoms bloom, as far as I am concerned but I ain‚Äôt spending any time on it because in the meantime, every three months, a person is torn to pieces by a crocodile in north Queensland
64. A 90% success rate is wild. We need this thing predicting cyclones or something fuck
65. Petition that next election we dangle the politicians and whichever one isn‚Äôt eaten is elected.
66. And if he's wrong, miles will wrestle jack to the death
67. So... who's here after the election results? This is awkward...
68. This has to be the best thing i've seen in 5 years
69. Did it just grab the one closest? Maybe it's the camera angle. But certainly looks that way to me.
70. I hope so. Despite their intentions I think greens are starting to do the Liberals work for them. Greens handing out stuff more anti labor than the Libs
71. C'mon jack you ripper! Let's please see the LNP told to shove it. I think a minority Labor government where they have to work with the Greens, even if it means they sometimes have to work with Katter, is something I am hopeful for. We need more cooperation between parties, especially in a unicameral state.
72. Jack will either be shot or starved to death. He totally fucked up. The LNP won Qld, so if he survives he will eat scraps for the next 4 years like all the less well off Qldrs while his minders eat lobster.
73. Okay, now we need to convince the rest of the world this is how we elect politicians exclusively.
74. far out... whos gonna be the brave cunt to break the news?
75. Jesus, even ancient reptiles make better choices then most of the NQ electorates üôÉ
76. ..and now Jack the Ripper is a crocodile belt. He's a useless predictor but typical of North Queensland resident... Fuck you , North Qld.....Look your kids in the eye and tell them you screwed them over.
77. Just saw something I'm not thrilled about for the first time in any state or federal election and they were signs out the front of my polling booth (saying cut Crisafulli - which whatever that is their message) but in the authorised by it did not list a party. Only a name and location. I've around for long enough to know what that location is being Peel St but it could deceive other voters to think there is some 3rd party not identified that has a campaign against Crisafulli. Nothing can be done about it now obviously and Labor will come under scrutiny after the election for it but they need to clean up their acts when it comes to the authorised by lines
78. It‚Äôs a shame ol Bob and KAP went particularly off the rails this election
79. the change in his face as he progressed through this statement
80. Hands down the best red herring in the history of Australian politics. üëè
81. Can't trust a crock to predict that, all those lovely dinners getting swept his way! 150kph winds, rivers swollen, rain lashing down, and the croc says "nothing to see here, everything is fine, perfect weather for a riverside stroll, bring those plump tender babies with you"
82. This is a great idea. Jack could come very handy in the near future.
83. No! The croc would spit Crisafulli out and he'd win by default!
84. The croc is now boots.... Never trust a croc or a North Queenslander...
85. I've been scrolling through this post for a while and was starting to get worried that I was the only one who thought the exact same thing. Thank you, fellow redditor.
86. The people who will vote green and be swayed by greens ads will almost always preference labour over liberals.
87. If I had to guess I'd say the majority of greens voters preference Labor. The ones preferencing LNP over Labor were probably never going to vote Labor to begin with.
88. LNP volunteers didn't even bother to turn up to the polling place I went to this morning.
89. I support the greens but I'd never preference LNP over Labor. I am sick of Labor shitting on the greens though, Labor need to realise the Greens are a serious party and either work with them or lose more seats to them My electorate, both state and federal, is pretty safe for Labor. It gets more Green first preferences every election though
90. This...so true. Fkn North Queenslanders have totally shot the state in the foot...because they believed the bullshit about youth crime. Almost hope their kids get caught doing something, so they experience what Liberals want to do to them.
91. If anything they‚Äôve helped Labor. See how it plays out.
92. 4D chess to spook outer suburban swing voters while making a deal with the ALP to pick up preferences in Townsville to form some sort of supply deal
93. When were they ever on the rails? Did a miss this?
94. I can't help but think of him as the starwars empire like one second his Palpatine next his Sheev yelling unlimited power.
95. No meat on those bones, compared to the Premier that can bench 2 plates!
96. Not necessarily. There are areas where votes switch between Libs and Greens. Like Ryan in the federal election.
97. Not always, there's some former rusted on Liberal voters who use the greens as a protest vote, will never vote for Labor.
98. I worked the previous federal election, the sheer amount of votes that I personally counted that were greens 1 one nation 2 lnp 3 was mind boggling.
99. those messages get in the hands of all types of voters push the idea of labor being a traitor on policy areas that‚Äôs not good enough for greens. That has ongoing damage. They don‚Äôt isolate LNP anymore. Every flyer today focused on Labor not one on LNP
100. You know what...you listen to the Channel 9 coverage...and LNP were just too cocky about their prepolling data. No matter how much Labor was leading...they were smug about early voting... Why is that ? Who was feeding them the data ?
101. I try to take them seriously, but they don‚Äôt help themselves. Their candidates are rude and dismissive when constituents try to ask reasonable questions about policies that impact them. I tried to read their policies and many of the pages for specific policy areas have last updated dates that are 5 or more years ago. I‚Äôd like to believe the fundamentals haven‚Äôt changed and that‚Äôs the reason for the dates, but for a policy area I‚Äôm reasonably knowledgeable about, I know one of the policies is already law and another is already in effect to the extent plausible, so facts don‚Äôt support that hope.
102. Greens have let themselves down.... They have crashed and burned in this election.... How did Greens go in your area ?
103. The problem you run into with greens vs labor preferences, is where the greens win. I mean, I‚Äôm all for a greens winning more seats generally, but in such a close election, greens taking more seats off labor is a real risk and if labor can‚Äôt form government then it‚Äôs the LNP. The question you have to ask yourself is if you want a greens member with an LNP government or a labor member with a labor government.
104. I always had considered Bob mostly harmless and eccentric. Nobody can deny he has been a great public servant for that region.
105. Not really, in 2019 the LNP got 52 percent of votes before the Greens were even excluded (ALP - 25.6 percent and Greens 22.3 percent), so ALP would have still lost. In 2013 and 2016 the LNP won on first preferences alone. I have never seen a seat where the small proportion of Greens preferences that go to the LNP (usually like 10-20 percent) resulted in an LNP victory.
106. So if they weren‚Äôt going to ever vote for Labor then the Greens aren‚Äôt doing anything to make them not vote for Labor.
107. Some people just want to break apart the major parties. The more independent voices the better.
108. Labor could form government by getting support from the greens even if the LNP got more seats if they don't have enough for a majority. The government is only necessarily formed by the biggest party of they win a majority. What I want is a greens representative in a minority Labor government
