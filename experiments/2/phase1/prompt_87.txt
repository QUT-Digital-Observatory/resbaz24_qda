Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. When you realise that the LNP proposals are nothing to do with justice and rehabilitation. Just revenge on criminals and zero care shown. As shown by the CLP in the NT, they really do want to lock up children.
2. The war on drugs works 100% - just ask any LEO from around the world how successful it really is ü§£
3. Pill testing yes keep that. Three strikes is too many. Get caught with something and you get a warning, maybe somewhere to get some help but the government won‚Äôt pay for that so we know that‚Äôs not gonna happen. Second offence, goodbye, off to prison.
4. why did so many stupid people vote for the lnp cringee
5. How many strikes should someone get for a DUI? You cookers all defending drugs like you would apply the same logic to any other crime is insane. They‚Äôre against the law and are not good for you. Yous say ‚Äúlook at the evidence‚Äù and then ignore all the evidence pointing towards these substances absolutely rotting the arse out of your brain. Do better
6. Why keep pill testing?? You know the risks already. You don't get to waste emergency services time or risk others who need the help simply because you're self entitled. And yes, no 3 strike rule. You're all complaining about the crime rate yet refuse to use common sense and look at the statistics relating crime to drug use.
7. LNPs attitude is that if you overdose on something you didn't even know you had then you deserved to die
8. "We don't believe a soft on drugs approach works" Our feelings don't care about your facts
9. Cos the hard ass approach has been working really well.
10. Queensland deserves everything it's about to get to be honest. You want to vote these people in, then you deserve the consequences of their ideology based policies.
11. Overall I would say it‚Äôs time for a change of govt in Qld, but my god this is a terrible policy. In what world is it better for people to die than to perform safety tests on drugs they‚Äôre going to take anyway?
12. Overall very conservative polices. I wonder if that will appeal to the masses? I suspect it will.
13. The majority of criminals have a drug or alcohol addiction. It is clear that the current approach is not working. More needs to be done to discourage the use of drugs and pill testing isn't doing that. You are removing one of the consequences of drug use which in turn encourages more people to take drugs. In saying that, this move alone won't be sufficient and I hope Crisafulli has a real plan to combat addiction. Making it easier to access rehab services from prison and providing more rehab services to inmates would help. The wait times can be too long for anyone on minor offences to engage with those services. The issue with drug rehab outside of prison is that the addict has to WANT to be clean, and they simply choose not to.
14. This guy has no clue what his doing.. In fact, this sounds weire but pure opium less harmful when injected than smoking it? Sounds crazy until I watched a neuro-brain scientist explain it. I know people that have abused painkillers (opioids) for 25 years and they have come out without damage. I'm betting 25 years of the alcohol and cigarette abuse would have way more damaging effects Even coca leaves‚ÄîPeruvians consume cocaine daily. Does it matter the intake? I'm talking about tea. Yes, they will fail a drug test. What about amphetamines for children, wrapped up in a nice package? It's still a drug, just more pure. I read natural coca tea is better for you than coffee. I bet you didn't know nicotine is the one ingredient that is actually good for you‚Äînot through smoking, because it's the other chemicals that kill you. Luckily, Australia looks after its people. Only recently I found out about nicotine. So, lucky for us, out of all the chemicals they could ban, they want to ban that one. By the way, cocaine, opioids, and amphetamines are still sold by big pharma. Last I heard, cocaine is used in operations to stop bleeding. They are also testing micro-doses of MDMA and LSD. I reckon if everything was in pure form, I would die from alcohol before any of the above. Marijuana is basically legal. I wonder if they do trials to see what is the most damaging. If they do, caffeine, alcohol, coca leaf, sugar, and amphetamines should be tested. I was once a curious person who had to try everything. The only drug that made me sick was opioids if you go cold turkey. But don't worry, the government will help you with that 1-3 week stretch of terrible flu-like symptoms. All you've got to do is take their brand of opiates, like methadone, and you never have to get off. In fact, the longer you're on it, that 1-3 weeks turns into 2 months. Instead of ripping the band-aid off, they just give you methadone with no plan to end it. In fact, they encourage you to stay on. The worst thing out of all of this is the withdrawal from opiates. But if doctors really wanted you off, they wouldn‚Äôt swap it for another type. They should taper you down and, in the final stages, give you a week's dose of Valium and amphetamines for a 2-week taper, and you're done forever. Cocaine‚ÄîI don't understand when people talk about withdrawal. You can go cold turkey with no sickness. If it's not made properly or ingested properly, it can affect your heart and nose. Amphetamines? I mean, if they give it to children, it can‚Äôt be that bad. I guess people are different. I've been able to stop every thing cold Turkey except opiates methadone is worse in heard. The point is, possession of a few grans with 3 warnings is better than wasting the court‚Äôs time. We should be focusing on the real criminals who harm innocent victims with violence. How come they used to sell opium, cocaine, and meth in pharmacies, but left alcohol and cigarettes with the worst chemicals imaginable? I recon the vaxcines done nore damage than the occasional user like the occasional drinker I'm conservative saying this, lol.
15. I'm in favour of natural selection,it's worked flawlessly for millions of years.
16. We're fucked either way, Crisafulli and Miles are both morons.
17. Am I missing something? A tougher stance on illicit drugs, rather than a catch and release system sounds like a good change to me.
18. I‚Äôm fully with this bloke, we need more like him. Stop normalising drug use.
19. Does that mean Labor supports drug addiction? Is that why we're seeing so many addicts, now? It's a shame Labor cut mental health supports. If people could get affordable and decent mental health care I guess fewer people would turn to drugs to cope.
20. Good - it's about time someone stood up and cracked down on drug users. The left wingers of the world promoting and normalising drug use is one of the most evil things to have happened this century.
21. What does it matter when you can just pay your way to keep it quiet
22. That's white collar crime, as long as you don't do it to the wrong people then you don't go to jail.
23. now THAT'S the definition of ADULT CRIME. DO THE TIME BUD!
24. Cause fuck you that's why!! These cowboys think it can't happen to their kids and even if it does, they've the money to make it go away. You and me may not be so lucky! The old rules for thee, but not for me comes to mind.
25. "and to ensure that's a self fulfilling prophecy, we're going to charge every person we find with drugs, so they have a criminal record and we can show statistics that show 100% of drug users are criminals"
26. EXACTLY. Addicts need medical care, and they need support to address the issues that caused their drug use in the first place. Jailing addicts does not cure their addiction, nor does it turn them into functional members of society. And if someone is using drugs and *not* addicted, then, well... I'm not really sure who the victim is in that scenario, but I support making sure that their drugs are tested, so that they don't get hurt in the process.
27. Yes, alcohol is an extremely dangerous drug linked to many crime, and health, issues.
28. You misunderstand! He's saying drug use leads to crime issues so he's just going to skip straight from drug use to jail. Efficiency! /s
29. It only leads to crime issues because you treat drug users like criminals, David.
30. Because the conservatives have to be angry at some group about something at all times. They must be PUNISHED for taking drugs. Don't ask why.
31. If this prick gets in he will have blood on his hands. Just shows this asshole doesn't give give a single fuck about QLD citizens lives or tax payers dollars if it costs boomer votes. He's fuck you to the medical experts, the police, the kids and their families.
32. Because LNP/Libs only believe in autocratic authoritarianism - it‚Äôs how they roll. It‚Äôs what some voters seek until they realise that only people with money are exempt because of the compromise to humanitarian sensibilities and corruption inherent in removing people‚Äôs rights under authoritarianism.
33. Literally **anything** can be said to ‚Äúlead to crime issues‚Äù when you‚Ä¶ criminalise it
34. Because liberals associate drug use with demographics they find undesirable, like the homeless, and use drug laws to remove those people from the streets. A 3 strike rule makes it harder for them to ‚Äúclean up the streets.‚Äù
35. What is a minuscule amount? What is a health issue? When does a health issue become a crime issue? All these questions are the reason this argument will never end.
36. HAHA I love the accuracy of this Dead ass, He's on some dumb shit
37. Bet he does more coke than the rest of us...
38. I've eaten a bucket load of musshies and they're peaking and this is accurate for that fuck head.
39. I must be out of touch, but Is qld actually super conservative? I thought this man was the favourite to win.
40. Note how every quote contains the word ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù. Not, ‚Äúit‚Äôs been shown‚Äù, not, ‚Äúwe know‚Äù, not, ‚Äúit is the case‚Äù, just, ‚Äúwe believe / don‚Äôt believe‚Äù. *There is a substantial library of research and evidence on which we could base policy, but what we ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù is more important than what is present in reality.*
41. Modern conservatism is conserving ideology (and a childhood worldview) from being eroded by evidence.
42. If people voted based on evidence both the evidence on climate, and the evidence on drugs would have them voting Green.
43. Nothing like a conservative to jump on a cause once it affects them personally. Scomo funding endometriosis because ‚ÄúJen‚Äù‚Äô got it ‚Äúreally put it into perspective‚Äù.
44. *Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.* ‚Äì'*Wilhoit's Law*' from Frank Wilhoit, but oft credited to Francis M. Wilhoit
45. And another reminder that the 'bad' person caught with drugs is often caught because they 'look bad' as opposed to the 'good' people who don't get caught with drugs
46. Or a kid from Logan or Caboolture. I remember watching a ACA or 60 Minutes story years ago talking to some of the kids from Caboolture and they pretty much said they stole stuff because their mums were on Centrelink and they didn't want to make their mums feel worse by asking for things. A few even said they spent nights walking the streets because it was safer than being at home due to DV. Not an excuse, but it's obvious that these issues can be worked on with additional approaches as well as prison time.
47. The perfect plan, create more crime then go hard on that crime, election promise delivered!
48. And then their siblings are deemed at risk and chucked into the privately* run camps. *There is as yet no evidence I've come across that this is in the policy but I would bet dollars to donuts ends up being the case
49. Abortion rights, VAD rights, pill-testing policy, holistic sexual consent education in schools policy, LGBTQ+ rights, decriminalisation of sex work and every other progressive social reform over the past decade will be repealed. Crisafulli and the LNP campaigned against them, voted against them, and have promised their base there will be "natural corrections over time." The Regressive Right have unfinished business.
50. I‚Äôm definitely feeling more protesty with every shitcunt policy announcement I hear from this shitcunt.
51. Never felt the need to protest in this country so far but I'll 100% be on the streets with a sign if these cunts get in. I honestly can't believe it's even a possibility.
52. I agree with this. All public servants should not be under the influence of drugs or alcohol when performing their duties.
53. I wonder if they would still allow a drug diversion if you go to church? What a conundrum it would be for them
54. They'll just stop reporting it due to national security matters.
55. Didn‚Äôt he work for him? Where else would he have come up with these shitty ideas?
56. It was worse in the past, check out the 1996 4ZzZ "Riot Day" The 4ZzZ Cybernana market day was held at Musgrave Park, South Brisbane. It was shut down when a storm hit with the police logic behind it being "people ran into the beer tent and there might have been minors". Mopunted police starterd riding through the crowd "to break them up" . Illegally the military police were also involved, but according to the the police "they just happened to be in the area". Of course nobody was ever held accountable because the police refused to identify themselves. IMO (and the opinion of plenty of others) it was payback for the role played by 4ZzZ in breaking the story of police corruption which led to the Fitzgerald inquiry. When Riot Day happened it was the 1st time that the coalition had held power since the Fitzgerald inquiry happened.... [https://www.ccc.qld.gov.au/publications/police-behaviour-4zzz-market-day-function-report-investigation](https://www.ccc.qld.gov.au/publications/police-behaviour-4zzz-market-day-function-report-investigation)
57. They'll be private prisons and the prisoners will be put to work.
58. His policy costings were released today. Slashing $7 billion from wages and job cuts for public consultants, preferring, 'competitively waged,' consultants from the private sector instead for future projects. Literally Campbell Newman 2.0.
59. I am quietly hoping that the whole abortion thing will end up having a bigger influence than people expect.
60. I feel like portions of the media in the last few weeks have realised "Oh shit, this cunt is fucked" but its probably too little too late
61. I remember in the 2022 federal election when Scumfuck tried a similar tactic the day before(?) when he released a ‚Äúnews story‚Äù about a boat of asylum seekers being detained off the coast of WA or something along those lines. Trying a last ditch attempt to scare people that the evil brown invaders were coming and LNP was their only hope. Lowest of the low.
62. They will. Then we have to deal with four years of their fuckery, followed by 8-12 years of the ALP fixing it. A tale as old as time.
63. Inflicting pain and seeing people suffer is really the corner stone of any of their policies. They care not for harm minimisation, they just see jails that need filling and to many people out and about enjoying things that they themselves don‚Äôt like and fill themselves with insane hatred to a point where they can only see dangerous underaged, immigrant, drug addled lunatics clamouring over the walls of their gated community compounds they‚Äôve all spent their life savings on to ensure they are safe and seperate from the great unwashed masses seeking to kill then at every turn. And even though the facts and data show unequivocally that they have never been safer nor more protected from such events occurring to them, they don‚Äôt care and just want to be ruled and run by masters who are only interested in ensuring the coal farmers keep all their money, and the poor pick up the tab just for the pleasure of existing in the benevolent sunshine that is their very presence.
64. Probably why he was hiding away from the public for most of the campaign.
65. It sure as hell won‚Äôt be because of my vote.
66. Yeah because of the media blackout which means Labor can't respond. Pathetic cowards, only revealing all this shit when a lot of people have already voted and when they can't even be criticised for it. Spineless fucking cowards, the lot of them.
67. How exactly are people in jail a risk to the community. I day keep them locked uo until they won't reoffend. It's disgusting how criminals have more rights than victims. And to think Labor does not care about the victims ...
68. > Criminalising drug users leads to further criminal activity, worse social outcomes, unemployment, etc so like why? Because by the time the effects start being seen, Labor will be back in power and it'll give the LNP something else to screech about while they're in opposition.
69. I don't believe in Hell, but I'm sure if it existed, it'd be full of Liberal politicians.
70. I hate that you're probably right. The courier mail and the bible would be the only things people who oppose pill testing would actually read.
71. They‚Äôre not backing the LNP here though are they? They‚Äôre urging them not to repeal the planned pill testing at schoolies?
72. The AMA is against the LNP here. But to answer your question: like everyone, doctors come in all backgrounds and beliefs and some support the LNP and some the ALP. Makes sense that, like everyone, they can be biased too, even if they try to not be. Here‚Äôs their scorecard for reference https://www.ama.com.au/sites/default/files/2024-10/2024_AMAQ_Election_Scorecard_2.pdf
73. How is the AMAQ supporting and encouraging pill testing "backing the LNP"?
74. Because a lot (not all) doctors are privileged. There are good doctors, no doubt, but generally they want to protect their earnings, which LNP do. Plus, it's tough going through uni to become a doctor, many are reliant on their family and take on conservative values. Edit to add, many have had sheltered lives
75. Hypothetically, I think if the government made a law that drug dealers (of any quantity) got the death penalty for dealing you'd also find a significant drop in drug dealing and drug using. I think the intent is to reduce hard drug usage... What do you think? Drug diversion programme's cost money and take community resources away from other good things. Drug use isn't particularly good for society or individuals. It's sad...and a bit pathetic. Diversion programmes send mixed messages that drug use is somewhat acceptable. Hard drug use is either acceptable or its not. If it's not, then penalties should be severe. If it's ok, then legalise it (without taxing it)
76. I do not agree with "sin" taxes. I think they're a terrible idea because if the thing is bad (a sin) then government should not make money from "the bad thing". Doing that is morally / ethically wrong. What happens is the government gets addicted to the tax revenue and becomes as addicted as the drug user. Once they include this known amount of money in their yearly budget they will look to expand their "money for nothing" program...they will increase the tax or find new "sins" to tax like sugar or "junk food". It's a really bad idea IMO. If you think drug use is a health issue, then you should understand that health is a private matter. You shouldn't advocate for the government to force themselves into your personal health choices..with taxes for "your own good" üôÑ I'm not completely against taxation....for running the country... I think the place could be run better with better economic management which would allow a reduction in taxation. As for 3 warning system.... It's pretty dumb. We are dealing with adults not primary school children. By the time you become an adult you should know the laws (around drugs) and shouldn't need three warnings before getting a penalty. Hard drugs are not good. People shouldn't take them. They literally killed people I know. It's really sad. Weed is a different story. It doesn't kill anyone. However I don't think it's ideal to get addicted to weed either because daily bong heads are boring, lazy and incoherent...
77. Usually people make a change in their life for a good reason, things getting stale. You might be a bit sick of your old 2005 Corolla so you buy a nice new Hyundia i45 or something. You don't go buy a dysfunctional hunk of scrap that'll give you tetanus when you go within 20ft of it but for some reason, most queenslanders seem to want to do exactly that.
78. I‚Äôm curious as to why you say it‚Äôs time for a change of government. What‚Äôs your logic here?
79. I mean the fact that all these major health organisations are calling to keep these laws in place speaks to the fact that they‚Äôre pretty useful. Basically every bit of info we have shows that ‚Äútough on drugs‚Äù legislation actually *increases* the harm caused by drugs. It means that current addicts can‚Äôt get the help they need without facing criminal charges which just drives them further into their addiction.
80. Sorry how do you link pill testing with "drug or alcohol addiction"? Where's the evidence (e.g. from jurisdictions that have long invested in pill testing) that this "encourages more people to take drugs"? Do you really think a young person taking a cap or two at the occasional music festival requires "rehab services"? Bizarre.
81. Great, so let's get rid of testing and regulation of alcohol. If people want to take that drug, then let them drink untested moonshine. If they die, they die - natural selection!
82. Are you larping as a doctor when youre also in an adhd sub asking what restless leg syndrome is called by saying you jiggle your legs sometimes? Edit: i guess so.
83. Well from your purely selfish point of view, someone who tests their drugs, finds something potent and avoids an overdose might mean that an ambulance or paramedic is freed up to respond to you in your time of need instead. Maybe think of it that way.
84. Among other things clogs up police duties with minor offences instead of investigation distribution and sellers. Treats drug use as the health issue it is which supports more people to into recovery, economically cheaper than keeping someone incarcerated. Google why is drug diversion better, it's all there, it's not a secret.
85. The data show that it doesn't work, and more people die. Hence both law enforcement and medical professionals supporting the current approach From another angle, there's also changing social expectations to consider. While significant alcohol use was the norm in previous generations, young people now are trending to pivot to other recreational drugs. Which may or may not be an improvement, but a lot of them are probably no worse. Personally I don't think young people should risk their lives taking untested recreational drugs, while others can go on a three day alcohol bender secure in the knowledge that their drug of choice has had to comply with standards
86. Look at America, that will show you how well it works (it doesn't). Treating it as an illness and only going after the dealers is the only way to change things (also decriminalisation)
87. It results in more crimes and more hardened criminals though?
88. Wells it not though. Why put people into the system for low level amounts of drugs. You can divert them to programs instead. Why would you want to cause then issues for the rest of the lives.
89. If it helps, I think you're missing the skill of critical thought. University will help with that.
90. Police have been pushing for better drug diversion for years and only got it recently
91. You are missing the last 60 years of history of the war on drugs. Spoiler: Drugs won.
92. To clarify, I think Crisafulli is a spineless degenerate, but this seems like a reasonable idea to me.
93. If we did ‚Äúlock them all up‚Äù, society and the economy would collapse. Did you not know there‚Äôs a direct correlation between educational attainment and recreational drug use ‚Äì the higher someone‚Äôs educational attainment, the substantially more likely they are to use or to have used party drugs such as MDMA, ecstasy, cocaine, hallucinogens etc. Your doctor, your lawyer, your accountant, your architect etc. are all *more* likely to have used recreational drugs. If you ‚Äúlocked them all up‚Äù how would society operate?
94. Sorry, you think young people taking a cap or two at the occasional music festival are "addicts" who are "turning to drugs to cope"? They're young people having some fun, my guy.
