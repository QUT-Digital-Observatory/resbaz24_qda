Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. See I just fundamentally disagree that deterrence based approaches *do not work.* If deterrence based approaches do not work, then why does our entire justice system evolve around deterrence based approaches? The entire logic behind having speed cameras and mobile phone cameras is they are supposed to act as a deterrence to speeding and distracted driving. Why have jail time and fines for bad social behavior if not to act as a deterrent to bad social behavior? How do you prevent workplaces from underpaying staff, and prevent food manufacturers from putting saw dust in our food? By having deterrence in place. Why does the entire system that works for the entire population suddenly fall apart and not work when applied to teenagers? Look I understand that the ultimate solution to pretty much most problems is to solve poverty, provide equal opportunities, better education, access to services and resources ect, and in a perfect world we would do this. But we don't live in a perfect world. In reality your just not going to solve a lot of the issues these kids are facing. We absolutely should do the best we can and provide the most resources and services to the most people. But until you can house, feed and clothe every person in this country (by the way a lot of kids committing these crimes, at least in my town, come from government social housing precincts) and control every person's behavior to stop the bad parents from begin bad parents, then you're going to need deterrents in place to prevent unwanted behavior from those that have fallen through the cracks. Edit, sorry I did not notice you were a different comment from the links. Just pointing out that I'm not ignorant of the studies. I just don't agree that the studies line up to the reality of the situation.
2. Do you really think giving young criminals endless second chances and never holding them to account for their actions is an appropriate form of punishment for the crimes they inflict on innocent people? You don’t think someone being let off 84 times emboldens them to continue offending? At what point do you concede and just say enough is enough?
3. Haven’t labor been in charge for 26 of the last 30 years in Queensland? What policies and programs have they implemented in that time? Also your ‘feelings over facts’ argument holds no weight as you know full well if your mom was stabbed to death you’d be emotional. You’re not a soulless robot stop trying to act like one
4. Ten years in jail is ten years the public is protected from them. You need to establish that leaving them free results in less crime total. It’s easy to understand why people support incarceration.
5. Yes. Better and cheaper than letting them roam the streets causing people physical and mental damage for the rest of their lives.
6. Which is where this becomes problematic. If the government tries to fix people not having a decent upbringing it will get compared with the stolen generations.
7. Where are you getting 100/0 from? If you do some research you’ll see that Queensland corrective services focuses heavily on risk mitigation and end to end case management plans including programs and reintegration planning which aim to reduce reoffending and promote rehabilitation.
8. What work visas do the Qld government restrict or give out to foreigners?
9. You can't honestly think the state government controls work visas and has any ability to make legislation in conflict with federal discrimination laws?
10. Bro, Crisafulli claims they are going to hire 34,500 new nurses and front line health staff, where do you think these qualified skilled nurses on mass are Gunna come from? Not here...
11. You are just ignoring the fact the LNP have no ability to stop foreigners coming here and getting jobs..
12. Do you think part of the problem could be that for these disadvantaged kids, jail is not really a deterrent?
13. When you look at countries who focus on rehabilitation and restorative justice systems like Norway and Germany, the recidivism (reoffending) rates are 20-25% and 25-30% respectively in a 5 year period after a prisoner gets released, whereas Australia’s punitive justice system yields a 50-60% recidivism rates for the same period. So half to the majority of criminals in prison right now will be readmitted at least 5 years after being released. This is why people are fed up with this “tough on crime” narrative. All you’re promoting is making is tougher to reduce crime.
14. Did you reply to the wrong thread? No one has said to give anyone infinite chances.
15. The figures reveal a reduction in the rate of youth offences of 6.7%. In addition, the total number of unique youth offenders has reduced by 2% since last financial year and by 18% since 2012/13. The rate of unique youth offenders has reduced by 4% since last financial year and by a staggering 32% since 2012/13. https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/100936#:~:text=The%20latest%20crime%20statistics%20from,18%25%20since%202012%2F13.
16. The pivot to demand I defend Labor is classic when conservatives run out of space to back pedal on when confronted with the obvious outcomes of reactionary policies. The fact you think I’m being a soulless robot for valuing the reduction of people who are victimised in the first place is also a great example of conservatives having such a disregard for reality that you’re reaching for blatant lying about an idealogical opponents position because your own position is insufficient to being presented on its own merits
17. So how many should they be given? What is the number?
18. ‘New figures also reveal extent of police ‘surge’ operations targeting crime hot-spots’ I’m not seeing any programs being implemented just that the numbers are down? Which is good obviously. I’m just not seeing a long term grassroots solution here which is what people are getting up the lnp for apparently not having. Also still massive holes of the non unique offenders being caught still being let out on bail time and time and time again.
19. I’m not conservative I voted for miles who’s in my electorate and vote against Dutton when he creeps around every federal election 😂 i can praise labor for some stuff but miles and labor hasn’t done shit for youth crime. Can you name a single thing they implemented in the last 30 years that fits your outline of reducing crime?
20. And that's exactly how the LNP are going to have to fill there target of new nurses, Why do you think Labor offered free nurse courses? Locally grown nurses are extremely rare, because the public sector competes with high paying private jobs
21. I will complain if they cut, because if they do it will be because the LNP lied, they said they'll invest and hire 34,500 new staff, if they lied about that..I will be pissed, won't you?
22. What? It doesn't bother me, we need more health staff whoever is going to deliver them, I'm just pointing out that fact for the LNP to reach target they need to bring in skilled foreigners
23. Says the dude who can't elaborate on a single topic
24. Engage some object permeance and think of a way to continue the discussion, rather then hallucinate a series of events where I said offenders shouldn't have consequences.
25. I’m not here to defend the opposition. I’m here to critique the government of the day. While I preferencee Labor overall, I also think they capitulate to the centre right in plenty of ways. Again. Pivoting to whataboutism is just evidence your own understanding of the issues are weak
26. Mate I just asked you a simple question twice you’ve failed to answer and you ramble on about ‘whataboutism’ and insinuate I’m a conservative. Your thought process is just a mess you can’t even converse everything is seen as an attack or personal affront lmao. Did you critique ‘the government of the day’ over the last 30 years of inaction or just say nah liberal bad? Cmon mate
27. Labor isn't in power, so focus on the LNP. Just like the LNP haven't said where the 34,500 health workers will come from. Are you that ignorant? Everything you are saying can be said for the LNP..
28. What? Thats exactly what your doing, hopes and dreams that the LNP will stop net migration, despite having no ability to stop people coming here.. Your argument is "What might happen is the LNP might stop migration and people taking my jobs"
29. You asked me to defend a party policy I never endorsed in a thread about LNP policy. If you feel like digging through my post history yeah, I’ve shit on Labor too. Just might need to wade through posts about anime and shit, but I’ve no interest in debunking straw man assertions that thinking the LNP are a bunch of self interested shits who wield political power to cyncial ends must mean I think Labor is perfect.
30. Why don't you focus on the fact the only way the LNP can reach target is immigration of skilled workers, instead of focusing on Labor and immigrants...considering the dude in charge is Gunna bring in even more, doesn't that concern you?
31. 50c fares was wildly successful and is going to continue under the LNP due to its massive success.. Our power pricing is controlled by bidding on the NEM the LNP can't really change our power pricing, would you prefer the same electrical bill and no rebate?
32. Last year we had the best performing economy, we have extremely low debt Burden, almost 300% less than NSW and 600% less than Victoria progressive coal royalties. Legalised abortion
33. Because Campbell Newman froze coal royalties for a decade, royalties amounted sweet FA, when Labor was able to reverse that, they introduced progressive coal royalties and then spent them on cost of living measures. Did you forget the LNP froze them? Don't forget LNP are for big business trickle down economics, not you.
34. Would you prefer the coal mining companies had the $1000 instead of you?
35. You've been brainwashed by the elite to make you think you should give them your shit for free..
36. Some misinformation; often bias information; always emotion Example: - fact: the RBA increase rate from 1% to 2% citing the combat of inflation as a reason - Murdock: Bullock doubled the rate despite cost of living, energy price to surge News are suppose to be informational. If you feel strong emotions, positive or negative, after reading it, it is good to consider what behaviour is it trying tricking people to towards
37. >Murdoch propaganda machine catastrophic for democracy https://independentaustralia.net/business/business-display/murdoch-propaganda-machine-catastrophic-for-democracy,18117 >Deceit Down Under: How ‘Murdochary’ Manipulated Climate Denial and Racism in Australia https://medium.com/@fionacloud9/deceit-down-under-how-murdochary-manipulated-climate-denial-and-racism-in-australia-76c1bf8aa2e8 >Australia’s media market is the most concentrated out of every democracy in the world. https://murdochroyalcommission.org.au/
38. 1. **Traditional News Cycle**: Print an attention-grabbing, often misleading story in major newspapers. Morning TV picks it up for "discussion" followed by talkback radio to criticize politicians on the progressive side or outsiders (good example: Yassmin Abdel-Magied). The targets are forced to clarify. Evening TV news take over and frame it as if the targeted person is now "defending" or "spinning" and their political party is "in disarray." At night, talking heads on Sky News or Fox News offer guidance to the government, signalling how the editors want things to run. That’s why the TVs in politicians’ office are set to Sky News or Fox News. Rinse and repeat. 2. **Social-media-led News Cycle:** Since the "journalists" are treated as unskilled labour and have to meet stories/mouse-clicks quota, they scout internet for outrage stories, usually from right wing social media personalities who in turns get their stories from questionable sources e.g. Telegram which is full of Russian disinformation. The stories are fed to the first step of the aforementioned "Traditional News Cycle". 3. **Direct to Customer**: Sky news Australia's YouTube channel is currently generating considerable revenue for this news organization. They basically made shit up or repeat conspiracy stories to get clicks. They are very careful because YT has banned their channels once for spreading disinformation ([Sky News banned from posting on YouTube for a week - ABC News](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-02/sky-news-banned-from-posting-on-youtube-for-a-week/13480634)). 4. Regularly they run some crowd-pleasers such as leadership speculation, "boat people", Australia is full, "scientists make up data" etc etc.
39. Anyone remember the ABC literally lying about war crimes by manipulating videos? This idea of “Murdoch evil, other media good”, is simplistic at best, or wilfully ignorant at worst
40. The guardian and ABC told me crime was down because the statewide figure said so. They all spread disinformation at varying levels
41. All media spreads disinformation to some degree now. It’s about clicks and views and fitting the agenda. Left wing, right wing… you are obtuse if you think it’s just “Murdoch Media”. It’s just more highlighted because he owns the bigger networks.
42. Don't even bother with this question, Mate... You're going to get the same leftist rhetoric about being ripped off, stolen from and lied to. When things don't go their way, they never lose, they just get unfairly ripped off.
43. >crime was down because the statewide figure said so. So, it's down overall in the state. Did they mention outliers, as there often are in statistics?
44. There's been a lot of claims of the Murdoch media spreading disinformation. Sky news claimed a video of a protest for Palestine was during the French election. As for qld specifically, I don't know which is why I'm asking.
45. Outliers meaning almost everywhere other than Brisbane? And No they did not
46. I would like to see a stronger regional ABC, I think it would be good for democracy.
47. Why is no one talking about all the massive amounts of youth crime scare propaganda by all corporate media channels?
48. There were all these articles in the Townsville Bulletin about the burden on police officers with the DV and how it shouldn't be their responsibility and social workers need to take over and they just want to do proper policing and last government was making it worse. Like I dunno I could be mistaken but isn't looking after the local community the main part of police work. Can't all be chases, blitzes, investigations and arrests. Got to actually show the community some love if you want to be respected. Also the reports you see on DV in the police force is howyagoing. The culture within is a bit twisted with how they don't get held accountable and women are scared to speak up. If Police are getting away with DV makes you wonder what else gets swept up as well.
49. Electorates changing hands are \*mostly\* regional. Those with large swings include the following (from ABC election live results). It doesn't matter what is in the media (ABC or Murdoch), or what "whole of state" stats the safe SEQ luvvies want to quote. When voters are crime victims or have family members as crime victims and are patronised and told there isn't a problem, they'll vote for someone different. Changing hands: \- Mackay - 17.3% \- Mundingburra (Townsville area) - 14% \- Thuringowa (Townsville area) - 13% \- Townsville - 9% \- Cook (Cairns area) - 12% \- Hervey Bay - 10.1% \- Maryborough - 13.3% \- Rockhampton - 10.3% That's a lot of the electorates causing a change in government. Other similar electorates in doubt are: \- Mulgrave (Burdekin area 1 hr south of Townsville) - 15%
50. Yep. ABC has been completely compromised. Coverage in lead up was like an LNP campaign ad
51. The next stage of grief commences. First it was stupid voters. I see we've moved back to blaming Murdoch.
52. > The Government's youth crime prevention measures are manifestly inadequate and are failing. Shockingly in 2021, 76% of young offenders across Queensland were charged with another offence within a year, 95% of detainees released from the Cleveland Youth Detention Centre in Townsville reoffended within a year and 100% of juvenile offenders on strict bail orders in Toowoomba reoffended within a year. Then there's the QLD Auditor general report that Labor ignored > Auditor General says ‘64 per cent increase in the average daily number of serious repeat offenders, from 2018–19 to 2022–23’, > The Auditor General’s report also shows that all of Queensland’s youth detention centres continually operated over their safe capacity every day of 2022-23. Yep keep blaming the media for Labor's loss rather than the fact that these reoffending rates are insane. The media has been against the Labor party for a 100 years and that's not changing. But they reported on something very real and Labor refusing to invest in youth crime here like in Northern Territory led to their downfall.
53. Must be the media says the reddit thread throwing a tantrum their political party lost once in the last 10 years.
54. Just keep blaming Murdoch and doing zero actual soul searching. I'm sure that'll work out great next time around!
55. The problem with this argument is that Murdoch media has been trying to bully us into an LNP government for decades and yet we’ve just come off 10 years of Labor.
56. How many days did we go without stating “Murdoch Media”? It’s a bit like that Simpsons sign: Days without incident… at the Nuclear Plant. It seems to max out at maybe 2.
57. So little introspection, and so little time. I see we're trotting out the same points as the Voice, and the election Scomo won - it's all misinformation and Murdoch, apparently, as if the majority of the state is too idiotic to think for themselves. If we haven't learned to stop discounting people's lived experience as "misinformation", and we keep totally discounting people who voted for the other side as "idiots/uneducated/misinformed/rednecks" etc, then we will keep losing. Many of these people voted for the LNP for the first time, and maybe totally ignoring them and belittling them \*isn't\* going to bring them back? Laying all the blame at Murdoch's feet isn't just intellectually bankrupt, it's a complete cop-out, and we won't win until we overcome it. Edit: You people know that falsely reporting people for suicidal thoughts just makes you look like whinging babies, right? Not really dispelling the notion of sore losers.
58. So much brainwashing and propaganda and humans are stupid enough to believe it all. I had no idea Australia was as brainwashed as the USA
59. There’s probably huge manipulation networks on sites like Facebook that are plumping up narratives of fear and hatred. Look up “Bell Potitnger”…that was 2017.
60. I think the obessions with skynews etc is because many have lost sense of what actual centre means. Today we are so use to socialist governing, that many people think insitutions like ABC are centre, when on an absolute scale, they would nearly off the cliff left. And this is why so many people think skynews is insanely right. I would say that in general, the population has moved continously left. And the proof of this is that even under Howard, the government massively expanded in size and so did left socialism in general, and its the main reason he lasted so long.
61. It would be when they stop spouting Murdoch talking points.
62. All metrics are that ABC is dieing.... on ever front their numbers are down. TV. Radio. Internet. Everything.
63. I'd like to see an ABC completely in step with a conservative government
64. >Local and metro radio both take their editorial cues for the 24-hour news cycle accordingly, mimicking daily Murdoch talking points like marionettes. > The media are the conduits between politicians, political parties and the voters. >They are manipulated daily, unwittingly compromised to adhere to the two party system. The ABC show Insiders is a case in point. >Host David Speers, evaluating the poor result from the Greens with Patricia Karvelas – two former Murdoch pundits with another current Murdoch journalist along with one from the other major media house Nine also on the couch – pondered of the Greens “what’s happened to their brand nationally”? And of course you can add Nine Media and Stokes group into the mix. >
65. What youth crime? I haven't heard of any for the last 24 hours. I don't believe that's a problem anymore
66. But and large, most of the other MSM take their que from the Murdoch Press. That's where what's 'Newsworthy' gets decided. Obviously, the other MSM have their own agenda's and they'll cover 'all things newsworthy' (the Abortion question is a good example) but it'll never be too the same degree or with the same relentless vigor as the topics on their agenda. Ultimately, the MSM simply push their agenda to the front, although, I'm not sure it's ever been quite as brazen and blatent as it is currently.
67. I think alot of people have, just not the people with the reach to go against the anti Labor attacks. Shame really, but what's the answer?
68. So what, it’s how you react that matters. Acknowledging community concern and proposing solutions is a smart move; telling the community their concerns aren’t real, the stats show a decline, no change is needed (etc) isn’t.
69. Because the people that buy it don't think about the echo chamber their clicks are creating, and the people that recognise whats happening don't care / read those articles given its been the pattern of journos since facebook got big Dont need to be accurate or interesting, just need a good 3 lines and some clickbait content
70. I’m in CQ and Facebook does enough for sharing youth crime information. It’s not all propaganda honestly The amount of cars being stolen weekly is pretty high and the fear is real with people. There’s an old racq report from 2023 which has my region as a +72% change in the number of stolen vehicles. New data may even be a drop on that, but long term, for here at least, there’s definitely an uptake in vehicles and potentially even unlawful entries. The number itself may not be increasing as much as people believe, but in the past few years it’s definitely increasing, the brazenness is increasing, and the reporting especially via word of mouth and Facebook is increasing. This is why people voted lnp, they’re scared and they want a magic fix. One they’re not going to get.
71. Or you could live here and be a victim of violent crime, or have a friend or family member a victim of violent crime. If you are really lucky, all three. This is not just some made up bullshit, this is our existence for the last 9 fucking years. This bullshit it's just a media beat up is the main reason labor lost.
72. DV is definitely something the police excel at. Ohhh that's not what you meant. My bad.
73. I’ve got no dramas with you pulling quotes from that report, it’s a valuable read to anyone even remotely interested in the crime situation in Queensland. However, it’s an extremely detailed report that reaches a very nuanced range of conclusions. You’d be right to say that it identifies a youth crime issue, and even that they (rightly) criticise Labor for it; but the report also applauded the Labor government for improving crime statistics and working well since 2015+ onwards to improve the overall system with all stakeholders that demonstrates their willingness to accept the reports findings and implement reform. It’s fair to say that reform is needed, and it the system isn’t up to the expected standard - the report supports that - but it’s unfair to imply that the Labor party hasn’t made ground while in office.
74. So, who do you think bought up all the regional newspapers?
75. When Berejiklian was kicked out of NSW gov for corruption, Murdoch ramped up _hard_ on getting Palaszczuk out of QLD and getting LNP in. Murdoch media didn’t suddenly decide they wanted LNP in power, but they did suddenly decide, in response to affairs in NSW, to kick Labor out
76. Seeing as how you are barely fucking literate: When you are trying to sell dog shit... after 10 years of it being advertised you might think "maybe I'm wrong? They can't be selling ACTUAL dog shit if it's been around for 10 years?" So you buy a pack and realise the truth.
77. They not only produce printed papers, they have online news, radio stations and a free to air regional "news" channel. Queensland has an 80% saturation rate for Murdoch media.
78. ⬆️ Shill account, created for this election, hence the clueless take.
79. It took almost ten years for the constant assault from Murdoch and Nine to get the electorate to forget just how shitty and dysfunctional the Newman government was. That's what happens. LNP shit the place up, Labor fixes it up, just as things are ready for a fresh start the LNP are voted back in and shit the place up, rinse and repeat.
80. Plus, sometimes these things take time to work. That's 1 in 3 elections, heck if you could dictate the winner of one in three elections, even just one in five, that's a pretty good return on investment.
81. It was only in 2021 that Sky News Regional free to air channel was launched. You can't say that did not make a difference.
82. Nonsense. When the majority of LNP voters get their news from those sources, thinking it’s impartial journalism - they’re voting based on misinformation. It is contributing to an overall ignorant population and poorer outcomes for our democracy.
