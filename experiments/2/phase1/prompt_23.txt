Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Maybe YOU should mate. If you care that much about abortion, maybe you should hold a rally to prevent unplanned pregnancies, since that’s the common cause of abortion. Have a talk with your mates about wrapping their willies up and to seriously consider vasectomies, and also maybe some consent based discussions surrounding intravaginal ejaculation. 81% of girls and women in Australia use birth control ages 16 to 49. Sounds to me like women are doing THEIR part, especially when you consider that not every woman responds neutrally to birth control pills, hormonal IUDs, and copper iuds are a nightmare by themselves. 81% is astoundingly high when you consider the pain and side effects attached to contraceptives. Very rare to see that kind of statistic surrounding preventative health measures in Public Health stats. What are YOU doing to prevent unwanted pregnancies other than the obvious?
2. You have absolutely every right to carry a fetus in your body to term and care for the resulting child until the end of your days. You should *not* have the right to force others to do the same, just because that is your opinion. #mybodymychoice
3. Oh wow, why didn't the women who were raped and baby trapped ever think of that?
4. So women Australia wide should never have sex again? How do you think men are going to feel about that?
5. I was so sick during my first pregnancy, bed bound, didn’t eat , was hospitalised during most of it due to a pregnancy sickness called hyperemesis gravidrum. Luckily I had a partner who could afford to the pay the bills whilst I was off work the full 9 months , and my work was supportive but that’s not the case for every pregnant woman. I was offered a termination several times due to how unwell I was but I pushed through as I wanted my baby so much. Now as a mother of two , if I got pregnant again, I couldn’t afford to be that sick and would have nobody to watch my children as all my family are overseas. My partner couldn’t watch them as need to work. So what choice would I have other than terminate a pregnancy? Luckily I didn’t have the condition the second time just normal pregnancy sickness and could still look after my first but if I had the condition with the second baby I’d have no choice to terminate as I couldn’t watch my toddler and be in hospital. There’s no support for women. I’m on a HG fb group. These children are wanted but they have no choice but to terminate as how unwell they are and work commitments. Not everything is black and white. Please be mindful , it’s not because they are using it for contraception. A lot of these babies are wanted but pregnancy has major complications.
6. You do know that abortion procedures are also used for other medical reasons such as severe uteral bleeding & heavy periods that don’t end after 6 months, small fibroids, etc. If abortion is banned it means the procedure is banned which means women suffer intense medical issues that have nothing to do with abortion. By the way, most women don’t want an abortion, and abortions can risk you becoming sterile so no one uses it as everyday contraception. Get educated.
7. Bruh, we don't even believe women when they say they have been raped as it is, what makes you think that we would believe them magically if there was a pregnancy as a result? Do you have to get the rapist to come and say 'yeah I did a rape, so she can have an abortion, all good'? What happens if your husband raped you but you're not ready or able to report to police for you or your other children's safety? How would that even work?
8. Sure, just tell your rapist to put on a condom while he's assaulting you. I'm sure they comply 100% of the time. 🙄
9. People literally do? I have no idea where this bizarre notion that abortion is the main birth control for most people comes from: what sounds easier, cheaper, and more realistic for you: having an invasive and painful surgery every two or so months that often take days to recover from and can have effects for months afterwards, or taking a pill every day? Abortion is used if/when a main birth control fails (which can be due to medication conflicts and a host of other reasons), assault, or severe medical complications. No one is having abortions every other month because they just felt like it.
10. Robbie Katter doesn't look like he's going to give them much choice over whether a bill gets put forth or not.
11. People would forget abortion rights were ever a thing here and it won't have any effect on their reelection chances in 4 years
12. Ranzcog doesn’t make any sense, the law would make things clearer and if you are doing it anyway what’s the problem? I suspect it’s because they are not treating babies born during abortion procedures
13. You don't think they'll be declaring a 'mandate' for the foreseeable future?
14. Issues that were never part of the actual campaign. What idiotic group are you all from?
15. In that case, better organise a march against children working in coal mines too. Oh, don’t forget to march against taking the vote off women - they didn’t specifically rule that out either. I suppose it makes a change from the Palestine marches.
16. So you're goal is just to irritate the people of Brisbane over absolutely nothing? Take that tactic and they won't support you when it matters. Protest fatigue isa real thing.
17. If you're going, I hope it goes well! Stay safe.
18. He has repeatedly stated that it's "not in their plan". He has failed to address that it absolutely appears to be in the KAP plan, and he will just be "oh no, I'm forced to allow a conscience vote" when it's gets tabled. Then it will be "oh well looks like it was what the people wanted after all".
19. How dare these nazi's recommend to add this abhorrent section to the Termination of Pregnancy Act. Equality for neonates? Disgusting. *"S 8B (2) states that any duty a participant in a person’s birth to provide appropriate care to a baby born as a result of a termination is no different than any duty they would have to a baby born in any other way."*
20. that is because, basic on history, they have voted against decriminalizing abortion, Fooli was too spineless to put his foot down and say that THE PARTY would not change the current legislation. it's as obvious as the nose on your face that they intend to vote on Katters bill to get it banned again.
21. They didn’t say that. They used extremely specific language: “it’s not in our plan”
22. That's what they said in the USA about abortion laws. Be complacent at your own risk.
23. I reckon they need more time to clean up after a decade of LNP. They've actually done quite a lot, you just don't hear about it because the LNP take every opportunity to distract, slow down, and shove their faces on the media as much as possible.
24. https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/policies/31 https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/divisions/senate/2018-02-07/4 Hmmm... maybe just have a look see at how they've previously voted.
25. Hey, I personally like the Teals. If it was all Teals, now **THAT** would be government. Each electorate having it's say. Problem is I don't have one in my electorate. I'm in a flipped Labor seat that can go back to Liberal. I *have* to vote for the lesser of the two evils at the end of the day, because the others are either far right or far left. I am tactical. I look at the electorate who will vote for the LNP, and what percentage will vote for a candidate whose vote flows to the LNP. You always put the lesser of the evils first. Then rank the other preferences according to evilness. But Labor always has to be above Liberal. Liberals sell out Australians. It's not even an argument. They sell us out. Every single time. It's just common sense to put them below Labor, even if you hate Labor. I would put Labor above half the candidates in my electorate. They're all far out whichever side of the spectrum. The far out ones go below Labor, then Liberal goes at the bottom. Only way to make a major party redundant is to put the at the bottom. 1-6... LNP is *always* 6. Edit to add:**I also never vote until election day unless it's necessary.** Things always ramp up in the last two weeks. You don't know what you're voting for until the day. Edit 2: ramble 😆: I vote for the candidate I want if it's not a major party, I just **always** put Labor **above** Liberal/National... because at the end of the day, they're much better for the majority. LNP is for the top 10%, and use fear tactics to ensure their voter base includes the below that top 10%. It's actually really fucked up. Labor is the lesser of two evils. That's who goes higher in **MY**, I repeat MY preferences. Pity QLD is about to lose tactical preference voting.
26. Imagine thinking Poorlean and One Nation are a credible minor party. Bunch of racists and conspiracy cookers.
27. Ahh, I almost forgot people that people as stupid as you have a voice.
28. >That’s exactly what people said in the US about abortion. Fuck me the standard of public discourse in our country is in the shitter. Are you intentionally ignoring the differences between Australia and the US? Anyone with 5 minutes to read should understand that Australian and US politics move on different issues with different demographics.
29. I’ll be relieved because it means women will still have control over their bodies, but I’ll also be keeping an eye out for the next attempt, because there will always be another Robbie Katter or Ben Hood.
30. We need both left and right or the extremes of either will take over. Australia also has the power to have a genuine 3rd party if one can emerge properly and represent something in a sensible manner.
31. You dad is wise, but he isn’t representative of all 70+
32. There are a few who remember and have stuck to the idealist ideas from the 60s.
33. When it does happen can the girls and I beat you senseless with fence palings or nah
34. Yup. *Queensland* Labour is totally to blame for the global supply shortage, the national interest rates, and the ever escalating catastrophes of the climate crisis. They are 100% to blame for all of these things, and we're doing nothing to change them. They were doing so poorly, that Queensland had to vote in someone with no clearly stated goals other than removing the main source of income that has put the state budget into a surplus. They totally didn't lose because that main source of income (the coal and oil industry) paid millions of dollars for ads and propaganda, to make Labour seem ineffective, despite the fact that they have been slowly but surely making our quality of living better for more than 10 years. But no it's totally Labour's fault entirely.
35. Yeah, wait till it's your foetus, that's going to be born a baby with half a scull. Idiot.
36. i think its good when people have choices and bodily autonomy actually :3
37. I found it in the end -- NUS and Children by Choice.
38. The LNP was asked about this, again and again. They were asked if they would rule out a conscience vote. They had this _explicit scenario_ (Katter introducing, LNP voting as individuals instead of a party) outlined to them and they refused to shoot it down. Instead they repeated the party line of "it's not in our plans", which is tantamount to admission that they're going to do exactly what the people questioning them are afraid of. The LNP are not ignorant of the implications, and their choice of wording is deplorably precise.
39. When these MPs were voting against abortion, they were in opposition. They knew they didn't have the numbers, and sometimes the opposition opposes legislation for the sake of opposition. You said yourself, they were not worried about their jobs then - they could follow the party stance, knowing full well the legislation was going to pass anyway. It would not be politically expedient, especially in the electorates that swung from Labor to LNP, to cast a conscience vote banning abortion. I would bet not every LNP member wants abortion banned, they are LNP for other reasons. And those that feel it would be risking their seat will simply abstain from the vote.
40. Huh, TIL about trigger laws. Yes, I agree that changing the legislation would not be hard with a majority vote. I understand why pro-choicers are worried about the situation, it's still a highly charged issue and decriminalisation is still recent. If the LNP ARE that cocky to try this, then I've given them much more credit than they deserve. I believe they would be kissing government goodbye until the 2040s.
41. It’s a tough one to guess. Might be our name. 😀
42. He literally said it wouldnt change 5 days ago. If that was the case though, that he did go back on his word, the protest wouldn’t stop him.
43.

44. That's bs, stop using that as a reason, Christian zealot is the correct term and it's both sexes
45. Honestly, I didn't realise there were people *this* obsessed with politics here. First time I've seen an Aussie election where there's people who are legitimately upset and crying over the result, instead of brushing it off and moving on the next day... Edit: The fact that people in here think we have legitimate US style politics where the LNP will ban abortion is proving my exact point...
46. Do you need to prove it? Good question and I don’t know the answer to that, but it is only 1% of abortions.
47. You mean like when the Labor government forced us all to take an experimental drug that has been a complete disaster, yeah that actually happened not like your false claim
48. We already do. Colleagues that voted LNP are openly racist "no, don't send your kids to that private school, it has lots of ethnics" was one pearler. Not wanting their "tax money spent on feeding kids with no prospects" was another. Oh, on abortion 'it wont happen to my girls, we live in Raby Bay"... what the actual. There is a divide. These people see me as something they'd scrape off their shoe, and that beady eyed cock womble is their man.
49. This murder is no one’s business but the murder and the victim
50. It will still be defeated as most of the Liberal Party will vote it down. There are far more important issues than abortion. For the overwhelming majority of voters it's not even in their top 10 and so it shouldn't be. Crime, homelessness, cost of living and hospital ramping are issues that affect everyone, whereas abortion doesn't, except for the self indulgent 20/30ish progressive left militant feminists. Have you always noticed how they are always the ones behind the megaphones and on stage screaming from the rooftops on any leftist hobbyhorse.
51. No one’s forcing anyone to have sex, babies are already a choice before they are conceived. Murder is murder.
52. Good news these are not be random babies women are fostered with
53. Yep, plenty of people in the city needlessly….. again, for something that isn’t even a thing - why not protest why the sky should be green. He’s unequivocally said that the law will not change, and the argument is “Maybe” he’ll flip on it. If that’s the argument raised, then it can be raised for anything either side of the bench - even still, can’t have your protest somewhere like the Mt Gravatt Showgrounds (or similar) with sufficient parking and still good public transport access - it’s just selfishness
54. He clearly said on his 131st and 132nd time during each debate “The law will not change” He only didn’t answer what his personal view is and to be honest, it’s no one’s business but his own - it’s kinda what makes a democracy - he is a representative of his constituents - he champions their views, not his own…..
55. Just because he didn’t say one thing doesn’t mean it’s his plan. Y’all playing conspiracy theorist here. Go protest when there’s an actual credible threat to abortion. Hell I’ll fucking come in that case. But stop wasting everyone’s time over something that might not even happen
56. Na honestly I just treat the politics as they are a joke everyone seems to think x party has there best interests in mind all while there getting fucked over by said party….
57. It seems some people are very easy to lie to.
58. Just to be clear, that reason was purely symbolic. Charges over abortions were not pursued and people certainly had access to them prior to 2018.
59. Ah yes I’m the female version of Andrew Tate 🤪🤪🤪 if my one sentence comment is one of the “most misogynistic” you’ve read, you need to touch grass. This kind of hyperbole is wild. (Also it’s “I’ve ever seen” [or read in this context] not “I ever saw”. )
60. 6pm on a friday? Why not save that energy/effort for the future if they decide to back track?
61. It was a criminal offence if you didn’t get a doctors approval, but basically everyone got a doctors approval, it was so easy. Many women I know have had one prior to 2018. The law change was just aligning the statute with what was already happening and had been going on for a long time. The laws were already interpreted pretty broadly and protected at common law, so you’d have to have done something really dodgy to be actually criminally charged in 2018.
62. A bit hypocritical when you all voted the LNP deal with it and don’t block traffic
63. Health workers, not 'professionals' and 2754. And 1217 of those were from head corporate head office (source Brisbane Times) Source https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-10-29/fact-check-queensland-health-workers-cuts/12819864 You can stop the misinformation now, the election is over, and you're generally preaching to echo chamber here and therefore not influencing anything anyway.
64. Exactly. If a baby has anencephaly, non-survivable heart defects, non-survivable genetic defects etc. which mean it will die as soon as it is born, parents are advised to terminate early. It is extremely traumatic for women (and their partners) to expect them to continue with the rest of the pregnancy knowing they will deliver a baby that will die. This is still classed as “abortion”. My cousin’s wife was carrying a baby with anencephaly (the baby had no brain and would only survive in utero - once born it would die) and they had to terminate at 20 weeks. Carrying another 20 weeks would have been hell for them. It’s traumatic enough finding out your baby has an abnormality like that and is going to die, no matter what. Imagine what that would be like. Put yourself in those shoes. This is a perfect example of why we cannot have the abortion laws changed!
65. Xenophobia as a retort is... An interesting direction. Go on, continue to hold fucking signs up, it does so much.
66. This you are not forced to accept a child but you arnt allowed to kill them
67. But killing a pregnant woman and causing a babies death is considered a double homicide.
68. Yep. But the campaign labor ran in progressive seats was ‘labor is the only party that will save abortion rights’. I was intending to point out that I hope to see all Labor campaigners, ex and current MPs and members at protests if these rights are under attack. I don’t often see labor supporters and elected reps at protests (other than possibly a couple of affiliated union protests) and I’m pretty skeptical of their genuine willingness to fight for these rights. I tend to vote Greens myself because I like that the Greens walk the talk.
69. It's a pretty standard procedure for abortion to remain legal in cases of rape, incest and or where it may cause harm to the pregnant mother deemed necessary by a doctor....
70. it's against the rules to be abusive. just stating the obvious, if you don't want to have an abortion. use protection.. obviously it doesn't apply in all scenarios, like sexual assault.
71. It's obviously a human who can live by then. I'd say 12 weeks max
72. abortion gets babies to god faster, you loons should be happy.
73. I agree 100%. I call the revocation of abortion rights "American insanity". I still don't get why you think protesting would convince the LNP to not touch them. I'd be very willing to join - this is a cause I deeply believe in, but I'd have to be convinced that there's a reason for the LNP to care about these protests.
74. Most medical conditions if serious enough would result in spontaneous miscarriage. Sometimes medical professionals are wrong too. Plenty of mothers told their babies would be born with XY OR Z condition and wouldn’t survive yet were born perfectly healthy. My sister was one of those people!
75. Exactly! Women aren't doing it as birth control and the Government isn't changing the laws.
76. Not no one. My ex's best friend had 6 abortions by the time she was 19.
77. So it's the guy's fault typical. 81% of women are on contraception, that's good, its only the other 19% that are the issue then. get everyone in that age group to use the pill and condoms bingo the problems solved. How about you start a rally to promote safe sex? it takes two to tango. when did human life become so insignificant?
78. 🙌 In states in the US where abortion laws have been rolled back, women have been dying from refusal of care or medical gaslighting when they present to the emergency department with an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy is where the embryo implants outside of the uterus, usually in the fallopian tubes, but sometimes in the abdomen. To save her life, the growing embryo must be removed and usually the fallopian tube too. Because they fear legal ramifications, doctors and hospitals are refusing women treatment or gaslighting women and saying they don’t have an ectopic and discharging them, resulting in their death. There have been so many cases! There is a very real threat of this happening in Qld if the laws are repealed!
79. You don’t believe women when they say they have been raped? What’s the matter with you?
80. Who cares what that hillbilly wants? LNP got a majority govt so won’t need to do a deal with the Katters thankfully because I have no doubt he would’ve come up with some inbred idea
81. Killing off free speech is a dangerous game. If you manage to get it through and another party decides to exploit it for their own personal gain and potentially even the benefit of their corporate donors, that would result in much greater damage than a bunch of cookers publicly declaring their ignorance
82. This is exactly why we are having the problems we are now. Because if stupid comments like that. You better love freedom of speech with everything you got because you can't even go on Facebook and call someone stupid without a 30 day ban. So imagine a prison sentence because someone didn't like you calling them a "jerk" or "stupid". You really need to educate yourself before you share any sense of your political opinion.
83. Your suspicions would be incorrect. There are well established guidelines and protocols for life-sustaining measures and their withdrawal. If there is an ethical concern, or disagreement about best medical practice it is deferred to the courts anyway. With this legislation, it is never clear enough to outline all of the possible scenarios that might arise. For example, if it is a criminal offence to not provide life-sustaining measures for a baby that will only ever survive on a ventilator, that might lead to babies being put through needless and prolonged suffering so that the treating team can clarify if they are going to be criminalised for something that would otherwise be a medical and ethical decision. You're holding up best practice, so that doctors can waste their time making sure they won't get criminalised under a nonsense piece of legislation. What about a baby that could survive with dialysis for just 48 hours longer? Do you prolong their life to give that treatment until they succumb under this law, even though that 48 hours would probably have been better spent comforting them and giving them time with their parents who just want to hold and love them. If there is nothing 'wrong' with a baby "born alive", it is already illegal and medically negligent to let them die. The law does not make anything clearer, it creates another layer of complexity on top of the well established medical and ethical standards, of which is there is disagreement over - already has a process in place to come to a resolution.
