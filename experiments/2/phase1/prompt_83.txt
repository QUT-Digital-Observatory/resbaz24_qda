Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Yes, they are inherently evil, They arenâ€™t there to represent the community, they are there because of the lure of power. You might start out with good intentions then itâ€™s all about keeping your seat, you become a slave to it, the communityâ€™s concerns take a back seat to your parties wishes, not the communityâ€™s, heck my community is calling for the government to act and call out Genocide in Gaza, my local member is silent on the issue, why, his community overwhelmingly condemn the actions there but politically, doing so will damage him. I personally know current and former politicians and know what politics does to people, yeah Iâ€™d do it, my career has been all about helping people but politicians only help themselves. Good luck with your ambitions, I wish you well and hope you prove me wrong but I highly doubt it, Iâ€™m yet to meet a politician that hasnâ€™t given in and let the power corrupt.
2. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-13/criminologists-debunk-youth-crime-crisis-claims/104445432 It's not just state wide, but nation wide they're at an all time low. https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/20/townsville-youth-needs-community-led-fix-rather-than-new-detention-centre-expert-says It's even noted here that even in frequently cited Townsville (which has the worst crime in the state) youth crime was decreasing back in 2022 when this whole debate started to pick up steam.
3. Yeah moot now. But yeah if they did rebates constantly they would have to increase taxes, but seeing as this rebate is a one off or atleast only a when needed not every year, then it doesn't give reason to increase tax rates to make up for the extra money being spent on the rebates. So the same amount of money is leaving our pockets to taxes but some of that money is coming back to us as a rebate.
4. Sure, let's just stop paying the military so u can keep a bit of extra money... are u for fucking real ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£
5. Does it? Please do tell me the departments you've had first or even second hand experience in running fine that aren't only doing so by paying 3 times the price to private firms to backfill the void. The dead wood still remains you numpty. LNP have literally announced they'll make their own independent (see mates) panel of dead wood to review it all. Talk about pissing on your leg and telling you it's raining ðŸ¤¦ you'd believe anything they spun for you wouldn't you...
6. Allow for individual staff to innovate and act independently to come up with solutions rather than taking away funding and telling them lmao get good.
7. When Campbell Newman made cuts they didnâ€™t sort through people on a case by case basis. He got someone to pick a bunch of numbers on a spreadsheet then axe them. Itâ€™s really screwed up how departments were run because vital people were axed overnight.
8. One set of stats show the number of offenders. How does that work when regional areas are majority repeat offenders? It doesn't mean there is less crime. Also, breach of bail has only just been made a crime from 4 October so let's see the crime rate go back up again. I live in a regional area. The ALP local member and their complete disdain for their constituents on youth crime is exactly what got them voted out. In regional areas crime is still a big issue. Even if the rate has fallen because the numbers are reported in a way that benefits someone, people don't like being told youth crime is not an issue when they live in a town with 5 cars being stolen a night, having their pride and joy torched. We don't appreciate hearing crime is down. It's still a problem.
9. Sounds good to me. Maybe youâ€™re not as dumb as you sound.
10. Every facet of my life is fine. I donâ€™t have any issues dealing with any government department. In fact, the last few years Iâ€™m kinda impressed with how good dealing with many parts of it has been. I have issues with private companies like Foxtel and Qantas. Abysmal service.
11. How precisely do you propose to allow staff to innovate? The only way is to stop other work to allow time for it, but if all of the work is important then that means you need to backfill the bodies with expensive contractors. The only other way is if staff already have spare capacity, which would lead to: why didn't they innovate their way out of it already?
12. I have a better idea. Seeing as u pay so much tax maybe u should just fund the country urself as u seem to think u are the sole proprietor for what every1 gets from the government already. We normal people like to call that 'head-up-ass-itis' and ur one of the worst afflicted cases iv seen...
13. You may not, but there are fundamental issues in the Qld government departments still directly attributed to the fact they were decimated by Newman all those years ago. They still haven't recovered. And where they have, it's a direct result of them having to pay 3 times the labour costs for contractors or consultants because the government simply doesn't have them and the market in Qld for a lot of industries is now so geared differently since Newman.
14. Maybe ur not understanding the gravitation of the problem then. Those government entities that you are happy and impressed with are going to end up like foxtel and Qantas if cuts keep being made and departments privatized. The same ones u say provide abysmal service...
15. No, you don't have to stop work to allow for it. Innovation and evaluation is a continuous process you do as you carry out your daily activities and is a constant thing. If you decentralise the process and leadership so that individual team members are given freedom to come up with ideas on the fly, disruption is minimal and performance and results are optimal. This is what is commonly known as Continual Improvement Processes and is a cycle all effectively managed companies should engage in. If you're outsourcing CIP and having to have dedicated teams for coming up with shit you're doing it wrong. It should be something each and every person involved in a process do constantly in real time.
16. Name some of them. What does the market is geared differently mean? Why would it need to return to how it was if itâ€™s different now?
17. 100% that is the optimum solution. In the real world you need some spare capacity in the team to be able to effect the innovation approach. It's also a huge cultural change for government. I'm starting with the presumption that the cultural change won't happen without an impetus, and that there might be no spare capacity. I'm struggling to understand how an organisation that historically has not encouraged a culture of innovation would suddenly start innovating. As a senior leader you need to do *something* to facilitate it.
18. I've already covered this with you. All of those who were sacked either contracted back via a private company, or left the industry or left Queensland. Many professional industries involved in those cuts haven't gone back because now the private firms can earn 3 times the amount so can pay double the wages the government can offer. The government can't just pay out their arse in wages because there a set tiers of wages they can pay people. No one is taking those government jobs in a number of sectors because the private sector can just keep paying more and charging more, it's a never ending cycle. This is exactly what the LNP wanted to achieve, they know they still need the same people to do the work but if their business mates can scoop up a whole bunch off the top then it's a bonus for them and a bunch get plowed back into the LNP through donations and votes and marketing campaigns. This forces the government to waste more money to achieve the same thing and the LNP just turns around and says it's all Labor's fault because they are bad at managing debt, when in fact we are always in debt due to LNP throwing money at nothing and then building no infrastructure or social policy and instead giving tax cuts to the rich and claiming to be tough on crime etc when in reality they just change the metrics for it to appear that way. LNPs whole policy platform relies entirely on smoke and mirrors to fuck over the average Aussie and reward big business and rich bastards while convincing idiots that it's all for their own good ðŸ¤¦
19. "In the real world, you need some spare capacity in the team to be able to effect the innovation approach..." No, it's really minuscule because it's such a passive process. "It's also a huge cultural change for government." It's not. It is something that is already in place because these concepts aren't new trains of thought. They're part of standard business management practices widely accepted now and have been for 40 years. You are making an assumption that teams in the public sector aren't allowed to innovate or come up with ideas and submit them, and this isn't the case. Even the military, for all its strict rigid discipline and hierarchal chain of command, encourages individuals to innovate and come up with more effective practices all the time.
20. Lot of word salad there. Name one industry that backs up your comment.
21. I don't understand, therefore, why the processes are not optimised. It's been an accepted business practice for 40 years. In the 30 years preceding Newman, optimisation didn't happen sufficiently (such is the perception). You're telling me it is encouraged. Why isn't it happening? Or are we saying that continuous improvement has been happening effectively, and there was actually no room for cuts at all when Newman did it?
22. IT is the industry I work in. It's full of contractors across multiple departments. It was all in house a decade ago. Same goes for planning, engineering, environmental sciences. That's the area I've studied in and at the time prevented me getting a job because it affected the whole industry across the state and the only option I had if I wanted to pursue that would have been to move interstate but life didn't allow it at the time. There's also a whole bunch of contractors associated with three of the biggest departments being Education, Health and Main Roads. Especially for consultants these days.
23. What makes you think the processes don't get optimised? Anybody can perceive anything if you lie to the masses enough about a non existent problem.
24. Ok so you canâ€™t name anything other than the one you are in. And thatâ€™s going fine. So what are you actually arguing here?
25. A perception that processes are unoptimised is a stated assumption in the thread. The core question is: what should a senior manager do when they perceive that processes are unoptimised. See: https://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/s/2dD7kVu3M7 Your answer was [paraphrasing] that a manager should make room for individuals to suggest innovations, and you're strongly implying that there is a continuous improvement culture embedded in the state government. Now my question is: are you saying that the perception is incorrect due to lying to the masses (I.e. state government processes are optimised), else why has the continuous improvement culture not yielded optimised processes?
26. Are you blind or just an idiot. I work in one field that actually works across multiple departments and engages with several industries daily. I see the effects across those unilaterally both first hand and from those I work with in other professions. I also know the effects of the fields I studied in because lots of friends from uni are in that space, it's still apparent to them, even the ones who work for council's can see how the council's as well as the state government are impacted to this day. As do the ones working for private consulting companies, some now don't do any private consulting in Qld because they are more than at capacity just backfilling Govt contracts. What's your experience to say everything is just fine other than you don't notice it or the LNP told you it's fine? ðŸ¤·ðŸ˜‚
27. Assuming I've understood you correctly, yes, the perception is incorrect and a bullshit myth perpetuated by Conservatives still stuck on obsolete neoliberalism ideologies. They're just convinced that anything public sector is inefficient and just assume that market competition is somehow the only way one can be driven to innovate and they tell this lie to everybody else as well. People can't seem to fathom that people can be motivated to improve and innovate simply because it's a personal interest for themselves to want to provide a better experience for the public or that sometimes people can motivated to improve and innovate because they want to make their daily job easier.
28. You literally canâ€™t give a factual example of where itâ€™s bad. Your experience is probably more just that you arenâ€™t very good at your job. Which is ok. You can still have a decent career in government. Iâ€™ve only worked private sector for 35 years. I own 2 businesses. Everyone I know from government employment says the same thing. Itâ€™s ridiculous compared to proper business. Say what you want bro. I donâ€™t care. The government has heaps of dead wood. I suspect you are part of that by the way you speak. Hope DC doesnâ€™t give you the chop. Take care.
29. Where's your factual example then mate to prove otherwise? Not good at my job? Yeah okay, that's why I'm employed to manage the IT for over 40 government business units in the south east weekly? Okay so never had anything to do with government, gotcha mate, NFI essentially. So hearsay without any on the ground experience to back it up ðŸ˜‚ Correct, however the dead wood is in the upper echelon of the show, and every time that is cleared out by one government is filled with the same dead wood from the other side. That never changes. The coal face isn't dead wood, and any attempt to cut that would only erode services or overwork others in the same job. DC sent a memo to all public servants this afternoon saying everyone is valued and no one will be cut, despite setting up a task force costing millions that's supposedly independent but filled with his corporate mates, to audit the public service to stop wasting money on people apparently ðŸ™„ You have absolutely zero idea of how government departments run, the good or the bad of it and absolutely no clue about how Newman's cuts affected countless departments and had far further reaching repercussions on other associated industries. Until such time as you've worked in the public service or worked with the public service, sit down and stfu about how you think it runs just because Dave and his liberal/courier mail cronies told you it's that way ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¤¡
30. Deal with council and government every day with my businesses. Itâ€™s a fkn basket case almost daily. The private sector doesnâ€™t work like that. Iâ€™ve got plenty of an idea lad. Go tap your keyboard. Cheers
31. Bullshit private sector doesn't work like that. Who do you think is responsible for all the cost blow outs on projects, the private sector contractors taking their piece of the pie at every corner just because they can. Had one builder/sparky/contractor/supplier collectively rip off 19k for a restocking fee on 8 products they failed to see had been removed from a project scope 2 years ago for a different brand. The products never left the distributors warehouse and would have been used on the next 10 projects but they all saw it as a way to sneak in extra money for their Xmas party. Many private consultants charging exorbitant fees for shit on the daily. Again why, because in a lot of area's they all used to work for the government until sacked, now the private firm can dictate the price to the government because they're all now in the private sector and gov can't compete with the salaries on offer. Catch 22, Govt never wins that battle since Newman. You honestly have such a blinkered view on the whole thing and can't understand he totally fingered not only entire departments but in some cases set industries back decades in terms of actually opening growth and prosperity. Instead he's helped out developers and private firms where most of the government money goes to the directors and not the employees. All the little guys get worked to death be it private or public employee and you get shit results on either end... But go on do tell me how teachers, nurses, and all the other front line staff they cut last time are dead wood mate... For the upteenth time, the dead wood never gets cut because it's all at the top, all they do is shuffle the Labor mates out for liberal mates, sack the front line and use their salary to bump up their mates they just gave cushy jobs who will do SFA just like the last bloke. ðŸ¤¦
32. I didnâ€™t say nurses, paramedics etc. I said dead wood. Iâ€™ve seen it with my own eyes in many government departments when we do projects, itâ€™s pathetic. Be upset mate. I donâ€™t care. Makes no difference to me. I work for a living, Iâ€™m not on the public purse like you.
33. No but that's who Newman sacked you absolute numpty. It's the same people DC has threatened to sack as well while he looks after the dead wood at the top because they vote for him. Ah okay so you're one of the flogs in private sector who rips the government off then? You did read I don't work for the government right? I work daily to try and save my business units money from greedy pricks trying to fleece the government any chance they can get. Don't act like you're not apart of the same grubby game here. Just another loud mouth who wants to trumpet the private sector is kind like the LNP purely because it lines your pockets. You're still dead wood on the public purse if you're working for a government project mate. Difference is you can't see you're actually the problem, not the front line workers losing their jobs when the LNP sacks them to 'save money' ðŸ¤¦ðŸ™„
34. No. And that's not at all surprising. For probity I am a ALP member, okay? As it stands at the time of writing yes the Opposition Leader would get Treasury briefings as the alternative Premier, but, the LNP will not have full access to Treasury as it stands at this moment. So the policies can't be fully costed by Treasury, but, they will have a ball park idea.
35. Great question, it should be on the lnp website? Weird if not.
36. Turn on an old CRT television, then tune it to the dancing static grey of the cosmic background radiation and it will be closer to the truth than anything they will publish. They have no plan, they have no clue, itâ€™s just free shit for the kids and hope they vote yes. Our local gobshite candidate actually published stamp duty relief as a housing affordability measure. In fucking Greenslopes. Nothing with two rooms is even eligible for the relief scheme as they are all over the threshold. Deceitful, last minute, half-baked clowns the lot. If I could vote to yeet them in the sea, I would.
37. Put the Lying Nasty Party last/largest number. That's where they put you.
38. All you have to do is read the policy sheet they put out and realize that the things they want to do are loosely/ unrelated to their reasonings. Or they use fringe cases to justify their policy decision. What that tells me is they have true intentions behind the policies that they are not willing to share, and they sent that to a team of marketing people who came up with post hoc reasons to convince the public to vote for them.
39. They waited two days till election to show. If you vote LNP youâ€™re dumb.
40. Pre-election costings by all parties aren't representative of anything. Vote on policies.
41. I was also trying to find the costings, none of the news articles quote their source, it feels very opaque
42. Yeah definitely leaning Labor/Greens but trying to be as fair as possible and read what each have published, if nothing has been published by LNP, I can't do much I guess.
43. I can upgrade this. If you don't know, (try to find out,) otherwise Vote No!
44. Yup completely agree, we've been trying to buy our first home for a year now and have been completely priced out. Funny listening to Chrisafullashitty though he's never mentioned that they were only raising the exemption cap which Labor's already done. I believe the fundamental issue is that there is not enough supply and too much demand for multiple reasons and not just immigration etc that people love to rattle on about. I think removing/increasing caps, letting people use their super as a deposit etc only helps to inflate the market.
45. Yeah because Family First, One Nation and Australia First are all much better choices than the LNP. Not to mention the crackpot Independents popping up everywhereâ€¦
46. >AUSTRALIA INSTITUTE: A quick look at these costings shows you the LNP are just not taking economics or the Budget seriously. [https://x.com/TheAusInstitute/status/1849683351168504129](https://x.com/TheAusInstitute/status/1849683351168504129) Apt video summary of both the ALP and LNP costings.
47. This is it. Projected budgets are pointless; everything changes, nothing ends up costing what you expect, and it's impossible to actually implement everything you want.
48. As per your Labor/Greens comment... Maybe a suggestion: Greens 1, Labor 2, nutter parties, then the Lying Nasty Party largest number/last. Reasoning: This way if the Greens don't get in, Labor will. Thanks for thinking about your vote and wanting to make it worthy for everyone. :)
49. Donâ€™t buy that Courier Fail bullshit line. CGT discount is 100% responsible for the state of the housing market.
50. No you havenâ€™t. Youâ€™ve been priced out of the most popular places to live. Guarantee you can still get houses outside the SE corner.
51. This is ðŸ’¯ the problem with numbering all the boxes, really gives me the sh!ts
52. Look, greens mean well but I'd rather Kony 2012 to actually be running the state
53. Oh yeah I definitely blame that as well as negative gearing and much more.
54. We've looked out as far as Ripley & Booval out Ipswich ways, Burpengary/Morayfield going north, haven't had a good look south yet but things seem to have also got very expensive in Logan etc. We've also considered units/townhouses in the past which we've decided not to touch now due to body corporate etc.
55. Make an extra box on your ballet form and vote for him then...
56. Plus, in inner city seats itâ€™s now a contest between Greens and Labor. Unfortunately by greens winning these seats a Labor majority just becomes even harder. Donâ€™t get me wrong, Iâ€™m as progressive as they come but Iâ€™d rather see Labor have another term than have a Green MP and an LNP government.
57. While I do believe some policies that the greens have would be difficult to execute for quite a few reasons I think they have some great ideas/policies and are willing to shake things up which I think we need, I personally think that an ideal party would be a somewhere between the greens and labor.
58. You're both fucking idiots. Material and labour costs are the only real reason for lack of development (as it's not profitable), construction companies going bust, and construction having a flat trajectory (unlike CPI). Blame Putin and COVID knock on effects. Do you honestly think developers wouldn't be shitting out housing like they had dysentery, if it was profitable? Nobody loves money more than developers except real estate agents
59. All of those places are in the SE corner. Townsville has nice places fairly reasonable. Regional cities like Mackay and Rockhampton also have cheaper housing than the south east.
60. You know, I think I will. If you think greens should be anywhere near actual fiscal policies, you need to get out of West end and STOP touching grass
61. That seems kinda of absurd to me, I haven't heard anything about the Greens refusing to form a coalition government unless I'm OOTL. The fact that Labor would prefer an LNP government to a minority government with the Greens speaks more about them than it does the Greens.
62. How would electing a Greens MP make an LNP government happen? The most it could possibly do is reduce Labor from a clear majority to a Labor-Greens minority government (but that's very unlikely). If neither Labor nor the LNP have a majority after the election, the sitting Premier gets to have the first go at forming the next government. There is no situation where electing a Greens MP makes an LNP government happen unless Labor walk away from the prospect of relying on Greens support for confidence and supply.
63. Yes, I'm usually an avid greens voter, but had to give my 1 to Labor this time.
64. This is why the greens need to rethink their strategy of siphoning Labor votes for themselves
65. I also agree with this and think that cause is an Australia wide issue, I just don't believe there's one single cause for what's happening currently as its being impacted by a lot of different factors. The Brisbane LGA having limited land left also doesn't help the situation.
