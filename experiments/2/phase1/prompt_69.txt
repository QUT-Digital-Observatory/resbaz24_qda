Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. A lot of local schools struggle to get volunteers to put on a democracy sausage bbq! Please consider signing up for a few hours and help your local school get some funding and help the local community get their democracy sausages! Follow your local state schools' P&C on facebook and they will generally ask for volunteers.
2. Sorry what did she say, verbatim, if you can go back, I wasn't able to. Because she was saying facts and stats aren't as important as vibe, imo
3. Cameron Dick would've called about 15 captains challenges by now
4. you know it's bad when even antony green is memeing about your slogan. this whole 'not part of our plan' shit has been absolutely pathetic
5. I'm in outer Brisbane, Moreton Bay. Crime in our area is not a real issue and yet still people are just so focused on it here too. I understand to an extent townsville and other places even if their logic in voting for the LNP who has the worst solution for it is off. On the cost of living it's absolutely mental seeing the local facebook pages (I only ever check every now and then to stop brain rot). You wouldn't believe the number of people complaining about the energy rebates, the rego discount, you name it. They would whinge about ALP giving them a million dollars if they did. Would say it wasn't enough. I just don't get it.
6. I feel like this is just closer to home because cause at the state level there is so much potential for so much to change that impacts myself and my family. Particularly my right to choose. I'm also hyper aware of the changes to state legislation made last time that was just awful and was only reversed when ALP won. While the federal election was a disappointment, it also just feels bad having had a ALP government state level for so long, and having Miles come in so strong, only to see it likely gone.
7. It’s taken almost a decade to undo some of the damage from the last time. The LNP spent their years in opposition planning how to do the most in the shortest time. Four years is plenty long enough for them to cause long lasting pain to many people
8. It's still a lot of time to do a lot of damage. There are still consequences of Newman that we are still paying for today
9. Yeah, in Sandgate we had LNP, ONP, FF and this guy. The LNP candidate ended up at #4 on my vote because he's the least nutty of all the nutters and that's saying a lot IMO
10. Nah, this was in Sandgate, Victor something. Wouldn't surprise me if there's a few of them around though
11. of course not lmao, he's been grilling the ALP all night.
12. I mean if the election isn't called and the opposition leader is hiding away in some back room, I don't blame him.
13. England losing to Pakistan was a nice start to the afternoon.
14. LNP will probably ban that along with drug testing if thur get in
15. Channel 7 started pressing him and he just gave up the PR and let loose.
16. Tbh, I think it could be good if it finally splits NQ from the rest of Qld. Make Qld like SA and but east west, and merge NQ into the NT, with a Canberra style capital in butt fuck nowhere so the CLP, LNP, and KAP can all be stuck in a desert away from everyone
17. >ROBBIE KATTER: We have the loosest Abortion laws in the country.
18. By trying to trip her up, do you mean "seeking substance and answers, so she couldn't avoid every question?"
19. To give some context, their questions would have seemed tough but it's because she ex federal government and she has some very strong views on certain topics.
20. LOL i wouldn't be that cruel to push anyone to watch Joker 2
21. no, just continuously disappointed that most jobs require people to be honest, trustworthy and forthcoming except if you want to run the fucking state
22. Spoken like someone with no experience in the industry. Do you think the government is that deeply involved in running the day to day of cs energy? Callide is ancient, like all our coal turbines and as we try to squeeze more out of aging and depleting assets significant downtime is on the cards for all of them. Also fires and explosions in coal infrastructure isn't limited to government infrastructure in Queensland, just ask anglo American.
23. Can't see how. Brisbane River up to Caboolture is quite literally Labor heartland. Sunny Coast or Gold Coast however is a very different story.
24. I think that was Speers saying I will take over
25. Well just on this - I said in the lead up to the election that this issue is now safe from conscience votes as Labor have got a minimum 25 seats and the issue now should survive a conscience vote anyway
26. If lnp are held to minority/the barest majority then you'd really hope a conscience vote doesn't get over the line.
27. Greens also don't help themselves by focusing too much on stuff the average Aussie (rightly or wrongly) don't give a shit about. Yes things like the Gaza situation are terrible. But when people are struggling to afford food on the table, they don't want to hear about it, but the Greens still put out a lot of stuff about them. Which gives the media the opportunity to take those sound bites and run with them rather than what the Greens are actually trying to do to help. It sucks but the greens need their messaging to be consistently 100% focused on the issues at home, because anything else gets used against them.
28. If they dropped their GMO stance and animal management policies they'd get one more first preference from me.
29. They won't have buyer's remorse. They know the LNP will hurt the people that they want to hurt.
30. Then they can start working on rolling back gay and trans rights like some of their candidates were saying .. Hope Queenslanders are happy to make women and lgbtqi second class citizens. These are the views of your friends, family and colleagues, people.
31. People who vote to make others lives worse because they believe the lies of career liars are fucking morons, yes.
32. I also think you can go too hard on crime. There's a balancing act, and it has to do with the voters. I imagine if you polled the electorate and asked "is crime out of control?" You'd probably get a high result. But if in the same polling you asked "do you think we should lock up minors in prison for long sentences?" You'd get a very low result. I don't think the LNP walked that line very well
33. KAP to lock Olympic events into northern Qld, and I for one am glad that if we're not gonna have bull sharks following Paris' septic swim, we can instead choose box jellies or crocs
34. A hung parliament will make the entire state a clown show.
35. Urgh...I forgot about the Olympics. That's why I was happier a minute ago
36. Yeah I don’t think QSAC is a particularly popular decision. Wish they had of gone with vic park
37. "Patient Taxes" being spruiked by the AMA this time.. We dug into it. Labor put in place payroll tax exemptions for GP clinics. These were expiring as per original legislation but had been promised by Miles to be extended. That's it. Literally a Labor tax cut for GP's that wasnt even expiring and suddenly there's new "patient taxes"
38. don't forget franking credits which didn't affect 90% of the population!
39. Of course it was lies. Her mouth was open 🤣
40. umm I'd like to amend my proposal. SEQ keeps the good stuff
41. Pretty sure regional Queensland has way more than 5 House of Reps seats already.
42. we can sort out the federal details after they create their constitution and parliamentary processes etc
43. Can't address something that doesn't exist LNP's suggestions have been PROVEN time and time again to be ineffective or even make things significantly worse. But, as per conservative policy, experts are liars
44. Sorry I thought our elections were on 3 year cycles
45. That was genuinely my first thought too. He sounded like he was channeling trumps gibberish
46. Yes it wasn’t very fun, if you go there the voting part is on Latrobe terrace not Roger’s street
47. Definitely more about the results at this point. I voted last week
48. I hope the Greens get Greenslopes. It was 200 odd votes they needed from last election. Fuck Joe Kelly, I would have voted for Labor if we had another candidate but that dickhead was one of 5 alp members that voted against decriminalising abortion.
49. Yep, fossils from the era of John Howard as treasurer talking about tinkering with price controls (Not really socialism, just an understanding of what government can do before neoliberalism wrecked Labor and Liberals)
50. LNP also has a chance to disagree on some things which means some policies won't go through. They're both socially regressive as fuck though so say goodbye to any progressive social policies from the past 30 years.
51. Okay thank you, I tried to make it very clear
52. Paid = maybe they don't care all that much Voluntarily = they genuinely would happily see you eradicated Not all politics is worth tolerating or respect, hateful politics is fucked
53. True if someone is advocating something that against my beliefs and opinions why should I respect them? I just diss every ALP volunteers whenever I met them
54. I hand out HTV cards and personally hate people who do this. These people don't have great people skills if they think this is an effective way to engage with voters.
55. Just say “no thanks” and walk past. Or have a chat with the party you prefer. Or even ask them questions about their parties policies, if you wish. Just don’t get offensive.
56. Maybe I'm lucky. I reckon in all the 20+ years of election voting I've done I could count on one hand the amount of "aggressive" card people I've encountered.
57. [Actually they are shown to have great impact](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-09-29/do-australians-follow-how-to-votes/9389834) according to this study I'm sure they wouldn't be doing it if they didn't have an impact
58. I’m so sorry that was your experience. My friends in youth politics found there was usually a good degree of camaraderie between all sides on the day.
59. Yeah like forgive me if I'm not all smiles and sunshine to a person telling me to vote to make my own life and the lives of my friends and family worse.
60. So everyone you disagree with is spreading hate, therefore you will be hateful?
61. Someone who thinks their local LNP candidate has potential to improve their area if elected ? Perhaps someone who has been disappointed with ALPs position in a certain topic? Family and friends of candidates?
62. Oh trust me I have family there who fall into that category - I know. I just thought the massive influx of people moving into the new estates (many from Sydney and Melbourne) would tip the scales a bit. I'll be interested to see what the final numbers are, seems to be a bit haywire at the moment.
63. You don't have to make them even happier about the win...
64. Where in his speech did he not respect the result? He conceded that the ALP would not win a majority. He thanked his supporters and said he had no regrets.
65. They've undergone media training to stop them from answering those questions. They have a very set list of approved phrases and statements they're allowed to make, and they're not to deviate from those.
66. We need more reporters to balls up and say, "that doesn't answer the question." Repeatedly until the question is answered. Let these slimy fuckers waste their time avoiding the question, and when they run out of time acknowledge that they have provided nothing of substance. Call these cunts out.
67. The flip side to this is how often the media love to pin them hard on issues and never let them change. 'Are you promising you'll never ever make any change to this issue' 'We have no plans to do that now or in the future' 'But do you rule it out ever happening' Like fuck me its nauseating
68. Doesn’t help them that KAP suddenly and unexpectedly wedged them on abortion policy
69. They have almost managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. Absolute disaster of a campaign in the last few weeks by the LNP and Miles did well to get ALP into this position.
70. Yeah I figured it would retain just was not expecting that strong of a swing there.
71. I put a grand on them at 11 to 1.
72. I hope that they cut him out for funding to punish him
73. They always favour LNP due to older/rusted on voters. Also when postals opened the campaigns and polling were in a very different place more strongly favouring the LNP.
74. I wonder how much betting is skewed by the reality of most gamblers being older, conservative men. But on the other hand, many people would bet against their own views if they are profit seeking.
75. It was $13 for scomo on election day. Betting agencies use statistical models based on bets placed and other inputs rather than poll data I believe.
76. Thanks for reminding me about Mal Meningas 6 second foray into politics. That video is an all-time banger
77. It gives him plausible deniability when any policy like the BDM reforms or abortion goes to a conscience vote.
78. wow you're so funny mate. I'm surprised because SHITLOADS OF CUNTS outside my circle have voiced their lack of faith in the liberals(the internet exists you know, easy to see a lot of other peoples outside my circles opinions) I barely saw any positive posts about Crisafulli, all over every sort of media. Try again
79. The one little bonus from a stronger than expected LAB result is that a conscience vote is much less likely to get over the line. Some LNP members previously voted for women's rights, you'd hope a few more tactful LNP members would see the deep unpopularity of this policy and not want to be on record voting against rights in future. Alp will block vote of course, so no leakage on that side.
80. What an intellectually stimulating response. What exactly is there to see beyond the Reddit bubble that will rationalise this result?
81. The bubble of making the mining companies pay fair taxes? State owned infrastructure to secure our energy futures? Free lunches for school kids? Nah fuck that, lets jail 10 year olds for stealing bikes!
82. Yeah I looked in the real world and didn't see any of the fearmongering nonsense LNP runs their campaign on. I can't imagine a much more insular bubble than being forced verifiably false narratives to cultivate an entirely alternate reality to get angry at.
83. It doesn’t have to be that way. Talk to people and actually try to understand them instead of writing them off.
84. Some of the people shocked at the result and how it could possibly be are probably used to being in an echo chamber without even realising it.
85. positive stuff doesn't exist. They basically ran on locking up kids and begging for a turn because labor has had the ball too long.
86. As someone who worked 10years in Hospitality/ Retail. Yes. Over half of people are fucking morons.
87. > LNP has won by majority vote, these "morons" are over half your neighbours, are over half your work colleagues, are over half the people you walk past on the street. Lots of people believing the same thing doesn't mean they're not morons.
88. Just wow…so only smart educated people vote for labour or greens, and dumb people vote lnp. This is not a healthy way to view things…You seem to find it very easy to just write off people with a different opinion as being uneducated…
89. First up is always the busiest. Quietest is about 3pm
90. NSW Labor is a shambles and Vic Labor only stays in office because of how terrible the Vic Liberals are. Queensland Labor is in an entirely different class to them.
91. Vic is fkd. it can never pay off its debt. It's really fkd. It's scary that qld continue to go down that path. It's already cutting cost and continues to increase and introduce new taxes and also cancelling infrastructure projects. Anyone thinking Government Money is a endless pit of currency is kidding themselves.
92. Winning slightly, Labor was ahead by 3% until pre-polling came in and it wildly swung the other way.
93. Oh we are still nowhere near as right wing as we have been in the past.
94. > Partly due to Labor taking up some Greens votes because of the actual progressive policies they introduced. I think this was the biggest factor. Miles really kneecapped them with things like 50c fares, power bill rebates and free school lunches. Probably the most progressive Labor government/campaign Australia has seen since Rudd.
95. I think all of the above the party needs a new leadership and strategy
96. > Partly due to Labor taking up some Greens votes because of the actual progressive policies they introduced. I think most Greens voters would jump you for that comment. Miles sampled populist policies without any true idealogic intent. 50 Cent Fares, but no funding package to improve connecting services. School lunches, but no additional money for Guidance Officers or Teacher Aides etc. He sold headlines, not progressive policy.
97. I thought I was in a reddit echo chamber so it was implied that it was Labor
98. Yeah sorry that’s what I meant KAP not PHON. Sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference.
99. But if it’s the reason LNP get to power with a deal with KAP then surely they’d go down the path of a vote, a lot of LNP candidates want to criminalise it.
100. They'll likely be a one term government anyway, it's just how it tends to go here. They don't care about winning a 2nd term. They fuck the state as much as they can in 1 term and then go back to screeching in opposition for another decade.
101. Honestly the best thing has been it's a Lib majority, so Katter can't demand a vote on it. Now the Qld LNP have to decide if they're willing to absolutely murder the Federal LNPs chances of being elected and setting themselves up for an election belting or not on their own.
102. I thought we were also in dire need of more paramedics, nurses etc? They are public sector employees? What is it that you want?
103. Maybe it’s just you that needs to be culled 🤷🏼‍♀️
104. D) Intellectual laziness and lack of critical thinking skills. E) Tribalism
105. B and C would have been relevant at the last election.
106. Yep. When you've been in power for this long then all problems are your problems -- even if you have little to no control over them. Federal Labor might get beaten in one term, mostly off the back of inflation and interest rates not coming down for a full term.
107. Sounds like a perfect excuse to elect the other party that will fuck us even harder. At least Labor uses lube and lets us have a snack break every now and then.
108.

109. I don’t think he’s that biased despite working for Sky, I just think he’s annoying and has a narrow-minded perspective
110. As it should, if you are shifty and non committal you deserve to lose
111. That's like saying the LNP would have done better at the last Federal election without Scomo, they can't guarantee abortion cos it's not what they believe at their core
112. I did vote LNP today and I agree. It really is a non issue for 95% of the population. No one was calling for it to be changed except for KAP so all you had to do was a strong No in the first day and everyone would have moved on. You'd think by now they would have realised the Labor party is a well oiled political machine with the unions.
113. There are still restrictions currently with 22 weeks. You could have had it before but obviously there were ancient criminal part that was rightfully removed. The LNP just thought they didn't have to campaign and they would get in.
114. I'm having a pretty mediocre day and this made me giggle. Thank you.
115. Which adds implications that one of the major parties will need to negotiate with a minor party or independents to form government (i.e. reach 47 seats). For example Labor would likely negotiate with the greens, and the LNP could negotiate with either Katters Australia Party or One Nation
116. the ones I spoke to were volunteers. and yes I meant ECQ
117. combo of that and the abortion clusterfuck probably swinging people from greens to alp
118. This and LNP changing their preference from the last election.
119. The lesson is that LNP always roll back nearly everything that the previous government did, no matter how good it is for their constituents. They're a party purely based on 'We're not Labor and we hate everything they've done.'
120. 80% of Victorians and South Australians live in the capital city so that can work. Queensland is absolutely not like that
121. I can't support it if it's not a part of the plan
122. Nah I donkey voted. Would have voted LNP had they came out and backed Vic Park but they didn’t. Hoping that this 100 day review will once again back a new stadium build.
123. LNP, wanting to spend money? That's not the conservative way.
124. You’re certainly not wrong about the general position of this sub being left but the reality is politics can be very very unpredictable like the 2019 federal election so it could go either way but I definitely wouldn’t use this sub to guide the election result
125. I'll be honest. I've checked the comments that are more liberal oriented and I've yet to see anything based on a positive reinforcement of the lnp. Only negative to other parties.
126. Qld to return to 20th century by gaining obviously needed second chamber to have any form of balancing chamber in Parliament
127. Would be interesting. But at the same time, we seem to do alright without it (Until we need to relearn our lesson for 1 term apparently)
128. It's a good thing for voters to get what they vote for. Unfortunately sometimes.
129. I think the greens lost some votes based on world politics that i won't go into. but basiclly people got sick of Greens worrying about shit they should'nt.
130. Greens have some good idealistic goals but they can be a bit "pie in the sky" and are brutal in application. Their only negotiation tactic is destructive stalling. If someone can take those ideas & actually apply them realistically then that's awesome. Thats what Miles is doing, and the Greens are failing at elsewhere (refusal to negotiate in a real manner).
131. 100%, greens have made perfect the enemy of good. If Labor came up with a policy that Max has wet dreams about, they would still block it because it wasn’t written in the right colour ink.
132. Granted that housing plan of labours was just going to push up house prices even more. Dumping money in the pockets of buyers... is just more money for relistate agents
133. Biggest fumble of Miles IMO. Should've come in, taken the recommendation for Vic Park, and moved on. It's just been hanging there since because it's still a discussion rather than a decision
134. It's hard to understand how anyone thought it is a good idea.
135. They've committed to a 100 day review or some shit which will no doubt go nowhere
136. Yeah but if the LNP know anything it's sportsrorts. Time for a brand new stadium to replace the Gabba in... Rockhampton!
137. What's your source? I'm keen to see it. ABC thinks it's 5.3%
138. Lol no I'd love to keep brisbane separate judging by the results.
139. Labor steals their ideas and narrows the polls, and the Greens are still blamed for Labor's losses. It's absurd but to be expected.
140. > The bookies don't set odds. lol okay. So what did Grace Grace open at? Yes they will adjust prices as news comes in, or based off sharps, but the mug punters have no impact on the price of a bet.
141. Actually maybe 55 - the pre-polls are really coming home for them
142. well yeah it's a democracy you can't always win and blame other people when you lose. He didn't even concede defeat let alone congratulate his opponent, as is customary
143. I'm a Green and I quite like Miles. Now if he'd build Perry Park I'd like him even more.
