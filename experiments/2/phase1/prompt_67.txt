Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. They pulled a bunch back after Antony Green said he wasn't confident about them. Looks like the editors are operating separate from Green
2. I donâ€™t trust any predictions seeing as most counts are still only at 20-ish percent. Every prediction is just the media sensationalising to get peopleâ€™s emotions running high.
3. Which is crazy considering it was looking like a repeat of the 2012 wipeout just a few weeks ago. LNP really fucked this one up (thankfully) Come on Labor/Greens/Independents!
4. Very nearly four years sober and happy about it... doesn't help tonight though that's for sure.
5. I think they're trying to guess it tbh, but Antony is being cautious not to call much with the prepolls
6. Pre-polls would be full of people pissed at Labor who want them gone asap. If anything Iâ€™d expect prepolls to push the lnp closer to a majority.
7. Sportsbet odds are now 3.50 for Labour. I put a bet on at 8.50. Edit: my bad, was reading the wrong one. 8.0 for labour.
8. Maybe, but KAP really sabotaged the landslide win claims for LNP with the abortion thing.
9. Letâ€™s see how nsw complains if we all move there
10. His one neuron fighting hard to send anything to the mouth to keep him from Tony Abbott nodding
11. Petrol stations and lazy MPs (in their own party). A+ comedy
12. The ABC taking SkyNews' star child is about as wise as trying to get Mal Meninga to run for politics, it's just a shame his smugness hasn't been sacked. His insights into politics are fucking non-existent, he just prods basic slogans into pollies and experts as if he's right
13. Agree, will look a bit silly if they get there and they aren't far off
14. Crisafulli needed for her anti abortion and lgbtqi stance - so extreme she was unpallitable for federal politics but perfect for QLD politics where she fits right in.. He put anti abortion candidates everywhere
15. Can you imagine a State parliament with Laming in it?
16. People who think jailing kids fixes all their issues are who voted LNP
17. Guy is surprised that people outside his circle donâ€™t have the same views as people in his circle. News at 11.
18. It's people who just vote based on the catchiest slogan
19. i hesitate to start blaming it on being rigged or anything but yeah, LNP is fucked. It's gonna be a rough few years. I'm not looking forward to having to spend the next few years fighting for basic human rights for the people around me.
20. They don't, a good 20-30% of eligible voters get bored after a decade and want a change. It'll snap back the other way next time.
21. Maybe look beyond Reddit and you'll see beyond the bubble
22. Boomers are a significant portion People also forget that a lot of people from down south that were upset with Dan Andrews moved up here during COVID. This is the first election where this impact will be showing.
23. Well they'll probably be out of government by the time all the degenerates they lock up get out of their new Crime training centres so they can blame Labor again for the crime spike next time.
24. You know what else are echo chambers, your friends, your family, the people you work with, the people you talk to regularly, your own thoughts, beliefs and sense of self. Your world is an echo chamber.
25. I don't understand the point of this post. This is not a revelation ðŸ¥´ Who exactly wondered if Reddit was a left leaning echo chamber? Shocker.
26. People have been able to post positive stuff about the LNP but just never bothered to. Must be weird to not have faith in the people you're voting for.
27. Agree, It's crazy how many in this thread are calling LNP "Fucking morons". LNP has won by majority vote, these "morons" are over half your neighbours, are over half your work colleagues, are over half the people you walk past on the street.
28. Absolutely. The vitriol and one eyed posts has really surprised me this year. Anything not pro Labor got down voted into oblivion. I get that it's the Reddit "demographic" but wow
29. She has to be one of the most unlikeable pollies, amongst some pretty stiff competition.
30. I mean it just won in a landslide in the NT, and boy have they embraced that challenge. Fucking horrific
31. I absolutely can believe it, but my opinion of people is pretty goddamn low.
32. Maybe they should push for mixed-member proportional voting? Would be a better strategy than whatever they are doing right now.
33. Not surprised terrible campaign and leadership from the Greens that party needs a overhaul
34. Oh no she won? That's dreadful, she's a terrible candidate
35. Someone forgot to tell him he's on the ABC that typically leans to the left compared to other media outlets. It's a bit bizarre....
36. fuckin 'ell that was quick, this bloke is clearly the right bloke for the job
37. Eh, I didn't see many people think Labor would win. People were fairly realistic
38. I remember the council elections when this sub was utterly convinced there was going to be a green wave and then were bewildered when it was business as usual.
39. Me, and betted on it too (if labour pull it off, I also get a shopping spree)
40. Nothing has been called yet, the election is very close
41. Possible, prepolls not counted yet so nobody really knows what's up
42. Possibility. The swing to LNP hasn't been as strong as forecast based on votes counted so far. So it's hard to predict at the moment.
43. Different interpretations and also different margins before they call a seat. Given the unusual shift late in the game I think being conservative on calling marginal Labor wins is a reasonable approach.
44. We flipped over to it (just out of curiosity) and the atmosphere was the most depressing thing Iâ€™ve ever seen. Iâ€™ve never seen a news broadcast with lower energy, it was comical.
45. I feel it's a combination of things. Partly due to the Gaza situation and Greens' focus on it where in reality, Australians on the whole don't give a shit and would rather see the focus being put here instead of a country over the other side of the world. Partly due to Labor taking up some Greens votes because of the actual progressive policies they introduced. Partly due to this election more than most being a 2 horse race between LNP and Labor. Not sure which is the biggest influence.
46. Really? Given whatâ€™s at stake? In an ideal world Labor destroys the LNP
47. 2016 federal election. Bill Shorten was odds on favourite. To the point where the LNP had basically given up
48. In 95 Labor lost the popular vote 45:55 and still won. Labor also slightly over performed the polls last election too. So yeah, there's definitely precident.
49. 1999 Victoria Jeff Kennettâ€™s presidential campaign pissed people off left right and centre. Steve Bracks won in a huge boilover and Kennettâ€™s political career was over. Leunig summed it up with an excellent cartoon.
50. Depends on who "we" is I mean, are you hoping for a Green victory?
51. Only possible phon seat is James Ashby and that is looking way off atm
52. Which would absolutely fuck the LNP Federally, because Vic and NSW would be terrified of Dutton, and Qld/WA would likely not swing as hard back towards Labor, so Dutton must be hoping dearly they at least wait
53. What are you on about? One nation arenâ€™t even on track to win a seat, how would that help?
54. One nation? They might not even get a seat lol
55. Thatâ€™d be the Crisafulli governmentâ€™s equivalent if pulling a Newman
56. Hard to say. Based on how much the abortion issue sabotaged LNPs campaign at the end, it seems like doing so would almost certainly guarantee them to be out next term.
57. I doubt LNP would go for it. Theyâ€™d be a one term government if they went down that road.
58. Youâ€™re not over-reacting. Many share your fears, but many others are here to support you and will fight the LNP with everything they have to protect the vulnerable. It wonâ€™t be an easy four years, but it wasnâ€™t the landslide we feared and collectively we will continue to fight for each other and support each other
59. As empty as these words are, take solace in the fact that it wasn't the landslide everyone thought it was going to be 3 weeks ago, and take solace in the fact that the LNP typically only ever form one-term governments in QLD.
60. Itâ€™s not an overreaction imo. Iâ€™m a 40 year old straight cis white male and Iâ€™m disgusted in this outcome. Federal coalition will be watching this result and learning what they can use to manipulate the narrative when their time comes now.
61. Please remember no matter what happens in politics, there will always be people in your community who love you for who you are. I doubt the LNP go ahead with the abortion stuff. If they do, the will be shown the door pretty quicky come the next election.
62. I feel the same. Absolutely terrified for my future looking at these results. I am so upset by how backwards we are about to go. Please stay strong.
63. I feel it'll be more subtle than Newman's stint in the big boy chair. Rolling back things people didn't know existed like the BDM reforms that help trans people, things like cutting the public sector, privatising things here and there and scrapping progressive ALP policies bit by bit while maintaining the scare campaign around youth crime or whatever else they focus on once people realise the youth crime wave doesn't actually exist. Either KAP waits and abortion gets put on the table and recriminalised early on and the LNP gets dragged over the coals and cements their place as yet another one-term government, or KAP waits until later in the term and slips it in and tries not to bring attention to it but I can't see Robbie Katter trying to do anything subtly.
64. Palashame hired back all those public servants sacked by Newman plus 20K more. As a public servant, there are way too many and there needs to be a cull.
65. Mining royalties. Because god forbid the residents of the state get a piece of their own resourcesâ€™ value.
66. A) a desire for "change", even if it is for the worse B) complete political illiteracy C) Murdoch
67. Despite all the pontificating about time for change, youth crime, blah blah, I think it's actually quite simple: it's tough for any incumbent when inflation and the housing situation have made people's lives tougher. We'd have been worse off under the LNP in my opinion, but people don't care, they will blame the incumbent.
68. Whether its the fault of the ALP or not QLD is changing and not everyone loves the change. The things people don't like are verboten on reddit.
69. It's hard for any democratically elected government to hold on to power for more than 3 or 4 elections. Like others have already said, when you're in power for that long, then every problem becomes your problem, even when it might not be. Also "it's time for change" voters are very real, even if they don't really know what they're voting for.
70. Brisbane/SEQ is very different voting bloc compared to the rest of the very socially conservative parts of the state.
71. Murdoch owns all the print media here and regional areas have sky news on free to air
72. Are you familiar with Queensland culture? A platform of being 'tough on crime' along with a strong cultural position against women and queers is all it takes to lock in half the electorate.
73. LNP committed to it for 1 term, ALP committed to it forever.
74. People who don't use public transport as well as people in the regions absolutely hate 50c fares since it doesn't directly benefit them. I know people who regularly use the 50c fares and voted for the LNP, make whatever you want of that.
75. You realize public transport does not really exist outside of the South East Corner right?
76. Man's been a hack journalist for years. He's asked pathetic questions of both parties.
77. Votes are not counted until after the polls close at 6pm.
78. If there's been a lot of postal and pre poll votes we might not find out tonight unless it's a landslide
79. Sky News (I know I know) have Anastacia palachook and Campbell Newman on their panel. I noped out of there quick
80. LNP - vague non answer LAB - answer and also calling out BS non answer Speers - haha shush campaigns over mate
81. Absolutely tanked insiders as a watchable program. Barry had bias but did better to hide it but he wouldn't just constantly interrupt and talk over anyone not agreeing with his personal slant.
82. I think it comes from the model of real estate photos. Slimy REA's and LNP ministers go hand in hand.
83. It was always going to be that way. There was an extremely slim chance of Labor actually forming government.
84. Like "youth crime" was what if not a scare campaign.
85. IMPoSSibLe. But also a bunch of people have gone to Amy McMahon's FB page to shit in her and I guess they are labor. I don't get it, it's repulsive. Just celebrate your win.
86. Are you for real?! Literally every 2nd political post over the last month has been full of expletives and insults towards anybody that questioned whether Labor were the way forward.
87. lol..you can't be serious. Have you read any of the post here? Lying Nasty party,Racist, Moron..etc the Left has been insulting LNP supporter for last 4 weeks.
88. Was that Miles he was talking about? If so that was pretty gracious - his whole thanking of Miles and recognition of those Labor members and staff who lost their jobs tonight was also very gracious. Much more than Miles' speech which was an utter disgrace and the worst concession speech in recent political history since the LNP will end up with at least 50 seats
89. LNP would have faired better with a strong anti-abortion stance honestly. The inability to be honest harmed his image more.
90. Less of a scare campaign considering how recently the LNP literally voted on keeping abortion restrictions in place, and with KAP announcing they'd being it back into relevance
91. Depends on the timeframe you see it, it could guarantee a single term government
92. No party gets to the 47 seats needed to form majority government
93. Neither major party has a majority Everything relies on the votes of the cross bench (green / independents / etc)
94. When no party has an absolute majority (more than half the seats) and so the major party with the most votes has to try and form a coalition government with a minor party.
95. They are ahead looking likely to be LNP 7.1% swing
96. There's not many people there volunteering for the AEC. They are all on the payroll.
97. High Postals and pre polls just made it drag on longer
98. Haha my thoughts exactly. This was still a LNP blowout win even after all the fluff
99. I feel like that's partly due to Labor introducing actual progressive policies since Miles became premier and partly due to this election more than most being a contest being Labor and LNP on their own.
100. Lol the LNP do nothing for rural areas. They just wear more cowboy hats in interviews
101. Not sure what the lesson is for ending Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, that would of created surely jobs for the local region of Mackay.
102. To be fair thatâ€™s how Victorian, SA. WA and NSW state Labor have their majority.
103. Did Labor ever expect to win this election though? From what I understand they were on damage control, trying not to lose as many seats as possible. I think they did a pretty good job in that regard. Labor know that the reason they win is because of their voter base in regional areas. Labor lost this election because people got sick of them, and it's much easier to be the opposition these days.
104. Would 80kgs suffice at his weight? Miles would have at least 15kgs on him
105. Did you vote for them based off a plan they never had?
106. You're also on r/Brisbane which is a giant ALP echo chamber. Some say its the official forum of the QLD ALP.
107. Honestly, the ABC presenter was right. Steven did good because he took the Greens policies and made them work. He took a leadership position and ran with it I'm a big fan of QLD Labor, but federal Labor can get shafted IMO. They're piss weak and scared after 2019 and I hope the Greens keep eating their vote.
108. Excuse me Labour... you knows those green polices steve implemented. I think you won a lot of votes for finally implementing green polices people have wanted for a long time...
109. The Greens are holding up housing bills and environmental bills, the latter could be disastrous because climate change bills could be passed separately, rather than needing to be an amendment, but having the LNP to complete our environmental laws or be the side Labor negotiates with would see Australia trend towards Mad Max. Actually low key pissed at the Greens Federally atm, their substance to volume ratio is off versus say Pocock
110. Nah shes got a point tbf. Adam and Max are holding up progress for unrealistic expectations around housing reform
111. Lol I just said the same fire the media manager
112. What decent Olympics infrastructure is that? LNP havenâ€™t committed to anything.
113. It sounds like we'll get plans for a review that might indicate a possible concept of a plan going forward. Unless it's not in their plan.
114. He's not allowed to say 'you're all fucking stupid' on national television
115. Can someone explain why Goldcoast is such a strong LNP stronghold? Iâ€™ve just moved here, is it rich old folks mostly?
116. The greens these days come across as a party that cannot relate to ordinary people with ordinary lives... Families in the suburbs, kids, mortgages and careers.. look at Max Chandler Mather and Jonathan Sri... They need to go back to the drawing board on their public persona and find a way to relate to normal people, not young, childless university students. Being so obstructive and not having any realistic policies of their own has really damaged them and Labor...
117. QLD is a hard state for them. Miles stole their policies, and the preferences were strange. If labor preferences aren't going to flow, they should join the LNP in getting optional preferences back. There isn't alot for them to do in a state that doesn't have a senate as thier support is broad(wasn't tonight a record number of 1st ?) and they can't do what KAP does and focus on only a few seats as Labor policies are to close to theirs.
118. The bookies don't set odds. They just adjust them based on bets laid so they always come out on top. The bettors got it wrong...
119. I swear I saw more betting odds here leading up to this election than poll numbers this time around. Maybe we're a little too into the betting at this point.
120. No idea, but Miles is the only one who deserves it
121. It depends on the state. Qld MPs elected after 2008 just get super payments while they're in office
122. He's clearly intelligent and a good speaker but not necessarily personable the way Miles is. Definitely someone you want in a senior position all the same.
123. Sad to see him go, as a young adult he is the first time I've seen a politician try and help the average person. His cost of living relief has been felt by all
124. I mean, Steven Miles has a lot of policies that really resonate with Greens votes, it doesn't surprise me really. Actually it does surprise me - but I can understand why it happened.
125. You have to wonder if lab/green voters are more inclined to go green in a safe lab environment. However if it really comes down to it will try to secure LAB over LNP in a tough fight.
126. Sorry to say but I think Max and Adam have shot the greens brand nationally.
127. Unfortunately there's not much you can do. Political advertising is exempt from spam laws.
128. I saw de Brenni all the time and didn't see Susanna D once. He's always out and about in the community too
129. De Brenni was consistently at pre poll locations, and my family frequently run into him out and about in the community.
130. That's an unhinged reason to consider changing your vote. If they way a greens vollie looks puts you off it's pretty doubtful you're their demo.
131. It differs from station to station. At mine, the LNP and PHON were aggressive, accosting people in the carpark and the Labor people were off to the side having chats with people. All that being said, I would never vote for a party purely based on how their volunteers acted. They're not hired workers so it's kind of up to the individual how they act when handing out flyers. There's no amount of niceties or pleasantry that could get me to vote for the party that actively wants to make my life worse.
132. What electorate are you in? If a hugely safe LNP seat, only the local hippy will be available for the greens and the ALP often runs younger members in those seats for 1) the experience, and 2) because the local branch members donâ€™t want to lose business because of running.
133. It's more about the person than what party they're in because you get this all over with every party. Some people treat it like a football game rather than an election
134. Tbh I want my Greens to look like hippies. Itâ€™s the ones who look like yuppies who are unsettling.
135. I'd expect nothing less from Queensland. edit: I live here, born here, lived thirty years of my life here. Brisbane? SEQ? Great. But where I grew up in rural Queensland, it's nothing but mouthbreathers and that is pretty common in rural Queensland.
136. Yeah hard to argue against this. He is a good speaker
137. Doesn't matter. Party references are just the order they tell you in their how to vote cards. You number the boxes in YOUR order of preference.
138. >but how do I find out You ask yourself, "Who would I prefer?" That's it.
139. Distribution of preferences does matter sometimes. There'll be "how to vote" cards at the polling booth.
140. It will differ across each electorate because of the different candidates.
141. Miles-sisters... It wasn't supposed to be like this. It's truly Joever
142. They will send you a notice of a fine, but it'll give you the option for a reason "recovering from a recent injury". You won't hear from them again
143. If someone can drive you to a location, the supervisor can bring the ballot paper to you in the car.
144. You can phone vote! They will read you your ballot options and you tell them what order you want. There is a second person on the line who will make sure that your vote is recorded correctly.
145. Surely the electoral commission has ways to vote remotely. Though youâ€™d probably have to jump through a few hoops
146. You should be all good because you've got a valid excuse. I've been fined before and they were pretty chill. If you have a reason like being sick or injured they'll wave it.
147. Hopefully sad, but that's just a broad hope that doesn't shift much
148. I could be wrong but I think ABC has stricter %s to call seats.
149. Not sure on that but she has had Kate's backing and was her choice prior to pre-selection in 2020.
150. I'm getting the opposite vibe. They seem to be gloating and laughing about greens losing.
151. If they reach a majority, which Antony hasn't called yet, but has said they *could*, Crisafulli would be Premier. That could then change at any time if the LNP lost faith in him.
152. Technically still up to the party but convention is that Crisafulli would be Premier. While there's no recourse until next election, the general public aren't going to take the whole "we know you voted for this guy but also get fucked" approach very well.
153. Crisafulli will be premier until he steps down, loses an election or gets axed by his party
154. If we're just talking who can form government, that depends how close it is - possibly as early as 5:00pm or so today, possibly late at night or in the wee hours if it's really tight. Beyond that it'll take a day or two for all the final vote tallies to shake out.
155. He hasnâ€™t called it, it could still be a hung parliament.
