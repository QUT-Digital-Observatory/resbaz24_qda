Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. You really have no idea how much damage a flood would cause, even to "just a carpark" do you.... A mate of mine had a structural engineering company before the big flood a few years ago, thanks to just water, hes now retired and his entire family is set for life. lol yeah multi millions of dollars beacuse of muddy water.
2. I'm just not a fan of using that land for a stadium. I don't see anything wrong with just rebuilding the Gabba.
3. Imo it’s too close to Suncorp and ballymore so traffic would be fucked. Inner north west does not need any more stadiums. It’s also inner city public green-space which there is far too little of. There’s a master plan to make it into a really attractive green recreation space and we should fight to protect it.
4. Upon further research, no development application has been been lodged yet
5. its reddit dude, id be suprised if people are toilet trained here, let alone capable of complex reasoning.
6. You can go in multiple directions from Toombul, too. Probably more than from the Gabba station. Post-CRR, Gabba will be served by Gold Coast, Beenleigh, Caboolture, and Kippa-Ring lines. Toombul will have all of those pass through, as well as Springfield/Shorncliffe trains. The CRR trains won't stop at Toombul generally, but I'm sure an extra stop can be easily added on event days.
7. Toombul has better transport access than the Gabba and nothing else going for it. The Gabba has worse transport access than Toombul, and nothing else going for it.
8. You tried to explain it and you were incorrect, lol
9. used to laugh at all the euro cars that wpuld be parked down there when the rains started. lol oh no, my car is ruined hahahah writeoff.
10. It doesn't just have to be a stadium, it can be shops and housing too. Its a huge land footprint. They can also build up.
11. The flood level isn't the issue. The issue is how do you safely get 50K people out of an active flood zone with little to no warning.
12. Alternatively we could avoid concreting over a floodplain and create an active greenspace for the area.
13. They'd be getting off the trains at a revamped Toombul station and added station on the air train line directly into the stadium.
14. how do you expect it to operate without at least a 100 carparks. All these people on here have no idea. Cant take a bloody elevated work platform onto a train or a bus can ya.
15. Personally I'd build an entire sport and entertainment precinct. Along with the stadium build restaurants, commercial spacing, residential buildings and community facilities. The carpark would actually be closed during major events at the ground as you wouldn't want to encourage people to drive to them then there are public transport options. Of course if I was king I'd buy out all the housing from sandgate road to Hedley Av and Hows Rd. Then I'd turn that whole area into a hub including high rise residential, commercial, hotels, entertainment precinct and sporting complex.
16. Kedron Brook has a remarkable sharp response time. It's rural in some reaches but urbanised in others. I think, from memory, peak flood levels occur between 1-3 hours for some parts and 3-6 hours in others. So there's little lead time as opposed to the Brisbane River which has 24+ hours of lead time. You simply cannot safely evacuate a huge number of people from an active flood zone in that amount of time.
17. ok and with no onsite parking, how do you expect bus loads of athletes, equipment trucks, vans, staff cars, specialist equipment like lifts, tradies with ladders, hilift gear etc etc etc to get there.... on the fking hopless brisbane busses or crap trains? Because a stadium requires hundreds of carparks, thats before you start to bring spectators. ignorance is bliss isnt it.
18. How are thousands of people meant to get from the station to the stadium??? continually cross en mass sangate road? youd delay tens of thousands of motorists , trucks, cars, busses, emergency service vehicles etc. Its an arterial road and provides primary road access to the airport and industrial precincts.
19. Ive lived in Nundah since 2019. True it has been dry since the big flood. But prior to that flood the carpark used to flood regularly. Remember the signs in the carpark saying not to park there during rain? The number of times I had to park on the roof to go to gym because that carpark was underwater.
20. They are entirely predictable, and there are entire engineering disciplines around exactly that. What happens more often than not is that developer cheap out of the more effective options.
21. I just can’t see having a major stadium in such a flood prone spot, even if it was built up higher. I would have thought there would be safety implications (evacuating 50K people in the event of flash flooding). How do you have safe exits when all the surrounding areas could quickly flood?
22. Can always find a park, but unless you go through the backway via Aspinall St navigating that surface lot on top is a fuck around.
23. This is silly, arguing semantics on a hypothetical but you're talking about congestion, not access. The infrastructure already in place (which is a huge consideration in 'access' for urban planning) is extraordinarily good. Better than anywhere else I can think of in Brisbane.
24. Build it and they will come. Transport links are everything. Sydney Olympic Park was built on top of an old abattoir sale yard and was essentially abandoned land.
25. Have you been to Homebush? It wasn’t a destination before the Olympic park precinct. Ditto Stratford outside of London
26. It was crappy. But Nundah real-estate is booming of late. I'm seeing a lot more old houses being knocked down in favour of new multi millionaire dollar homes. Defintely more money moving into the area. Maybe rich Melbournians who knows.
27. What you would do is lower the ground level to be closer to the height of kedron brook. This would mean when the banks do break the water will spread across a much wider area of the whole carpark space. This slows the water down and would mean that any debris in the water would have very little momentum to cause strike damage. You wouldn't put specific drainage in, as the whole carpark under the stadium would be a water pathway. You may need to put some steel posts in front of some of the leading edge concrete pillars to protect from strikes, but it's only going to be the front ones.
28. They need kayaking courses anyway, why not an underground one /s
29. I didn't make my thread out of thin air. There are rumours.
30. Buranda station is also walking distance from the Gabba and it will service other lines too once CRR comes on board. The idea that Toombul is better located is a fantasy.
31. A stadium with shops and housing cannot fit on the site unless you want to have a tiny stadium and/or acquire a number of existing houses.
32. Even if it doesnt flood, how do you get 50,000 people to and from a site thats bumper to bumper on a mid week day nearly all day.????
33. There's a lot of greenspace around that area already... I would agree otherwise. I think some form of community hub or shopping centre w/ apartments (like Coorparoo's development) would be more ideal.
34. Yeah I'm basically referring to the absolute bare minimum for people to load in/out, taxi drop off zones and parking for buses or vehicles absolutely necessary for operation. I do not support any sort car park for general attendees, and we should also block off street parking to anyone who is not a resident because the area is genuinely so fucked already with residential street parking. If people started parking and walking from the neighbourhood streets, it would be a shit show.
35. The area can't handle all of that without major changes, and most of the residents would not be happy with a Newstead or South Brisbane type change to the area. The biggest hurdle is the streets and roads. If you're local to the area, you should already be aware, but if you're not, let me set the scene for you. Narrow streets with cars parked on both sides making it difficult to drive more than one car at a time. The main road, Melton Road only has one zebra crossing and people are constantly blowing through it. It's next to a park and there are kids frequently using this crossing. Trying to walk across Melton Road for anyone trying to go towards Nundah Village/Nundah train station is a shit show due to people speeding down the road and the only one zebra crossing down the road. Combined with people dangerously turning or jumping across the road who are commuting by car, it feels so sketchy to try and walk to the train in the morning. We need a lot more traffic calming and pedestration islands, plus widening of roads to accommodate cars. We have so many cars on the street because we already don't have enough parking. What happens is we have a lot of dense housing, but due to cost of living pressures, many of these units are sharehouses which means most people have more cars than parking spaces. Our services are incredibly limited at the moment, with one pretty small grocery store. There is no way in hell we can even begin to entertain the thought of changing the area without a promise we will get some level of commercial back. In my opinion we deserve to see something on par with Aspley Hypermarket. Doesn't need to be a full-blown shopping centre, but we really do deserve more food and ideally a Kmart, Big W or Target. We already have the Gabba and need to update it anyway. Plus look at all the money that's gone into CRR. Do the stadium there. I agree, Toombul is a great site for redevelopment, but I think it would be far better to convert it into green space (closest to Kedron Brook), plus commercial and residential up to 10 stories or so. If they're going to go all in and make it a stadium or entertainment precinct it's total bullshit that it's not even CONNECTED to the airport line despite being right next to the airport. Get rid of the bullshit fees too for using the airport line.
36. If the response time it that quick, then just leave the whole area open and never use it as a carpark. It's not like the gabba, Lang Park or Victoria park have parking anyway.
37. How does anyone from the Gold Coast get to the stadium when the Gold coast train line seems to be down 1 week a month aswell?
38. I have never seen anything like what happened in 2022. I honestly think it was 1 in 500 year event. Yeah the lower carpark occasionally flooded maybe once every 2 years but it recedes quickly within hours. Its actually very easily mitigated with smart engineering.
39. In a completely controlled environment water flows can be reliably predicted and controlled, yeah I know that I’ve seen how they do it in autocad. However no two floods are the same, they are completely uncontrolled and can vary depending on the quantity, duration and location of rain falling on our catchments. I’m referring to overland flash flooding, which is unpredictable, changes depending on where the downpour is happening over a huge expanse of land, and can occur almost anywhere there is a relatively short, intense burst of rainfall such as during heavy thunderstorms. As has been observed first hand by most of us many times Brisbane drainage systems have insufficient capacity to cope with short intense downpour. Flash floods are common and happen often in and around Kedron Brook, and they pose a significant threat because of the unpredictability of where flows initiate and what creeks and river beds surge and also have the added complexity due to short notice and normally short duration - it’s difficult to reliably measure or track the flows. If you actually believe you personally can predict and solve the Kedron Brook flood plain problem please reach out to BCC who have thus far completely failed to manage it whether they have consulted with Engineers or not. Often enough Kedron Brook goes from a small waterway to as wide as the Brisbane river and I for one would love to see how you would manage all of that water without causing further problems to residents and infrastructure - please keep me in the loop too, as an interested local who has been here through three major flooding events. In addition to property damage, floods also frequently damage power transmission and sometimes power generation, which then has knock-on effects to mitigation as well.
40. You ensure those entry and exit paths are built up past the 1/500 AEP, which in that area would simply be a connection up to the level of the station. Beyond that you can run buses and trains. You may as well when you already have all the earthmoving equipment present.
41. They might come, they might not. It didn't work that way for, say, Waverley Park - and Sydney Olympic Park isn't exactly light years away from the city. It's far better to take the solid bet of just sticking with a central location, IMO.
42. Haha, quite possibly. Nundah is a little bit hip, occasionally. But Brisbane's best self is still the view from HSW.
43. The train line from the Gabba also passes through Toombul. If you can catch a train to the Gabba from somewhere, you can also catch a train to Toombul. Plus Toombul has trains to Shorncliffe and Cleveland. Meanwhile the Gabba busway is a short spur that doesn't really go anywhere. When the stadium is in use, Stanley Street is closed to make up for a lack of space at the Gabba, and all buses in the busway station are turned around and sent back to the city (which is, of course, one of the destinations that will be served by the train). I didn't say that the Gabba has no transport, just that Toombul has better transport. Both options suck as an Stadium venue though.
44. Have a look at the footprint of Toombul on Google satellite. To make it a square shaped site they need to buy out a few small apartment blocks, from my contacts in real estate apartments there are selling for almost triple the price they were a few years ago. They are selling like hot cakes. Something is going on. Anticipating a buy out?
45. Indeed. I mean, transportation infrastructure could be built but it's a highly congested area at the best of times, in terms of residential areas and existing road networks. It's also a super duper shit place to put a stadium for anyone who doesn't live in the immediate vicinity. There is a reason a stadium like this needs to be central...it's so 50K+ people can go to and from quickly. You can't just whack it in a suburb and go "that's great". Stadiums should be walking distance from a major hub, not out in the suburbs.
46. Melton road would be part of the redevelopment. It would have to include better pedestrian access and safety. It should also totally include commercial retail components. It wouldn't make sense to "just" do a stadium. Make it an entire complex with everything from supermarkets to restaurants. Give people a reason to go there on a tuesday night. It should be an overall massive improvement in services for people local to the area. But it wouldn't be without drawbacks too. There would be increased noise, and additional traffic which would need to be designed around to mitigate. It's partially why I would be looking to resume all the properties around it. But that is problematic as well. Personally I'd also build a second rail station on the airport line so that you had rail from 2 locations. The Gabba is in a terrible location, structurally is at EOL and needs major refurb. I'd bulldose the whole thing and build high rise residential myself.
47. Nothing to do with the car parks, more the 50K+ people walking around the area.
48. Autocad is absolutely the wrong sort of software to be attempting flood modelling in when looking at catchment scale issues. We also do not need to assume a controlled environment, either. Not with modern techniques. Speaking from experience as a geomorphologist with an additional engineering geomechanics degree who now has a second career looking after various studies in this space, I'd be pointing you in the direction of software packages such as Tuflow, statistical techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations, even Discrete Event Simulation + hydrology modelling including infiltration, systematic back pressure, etc. Place this over a catchment model using high resolution lidar (which exists and is recent for this area), as well as incorporating the existing built drainage model (also exists and is recent), and you're well on the way to being able to model what's likely to occur under many different conditions. In this example you do not actually need to solve for Kedron Brook specifically, and you're looking at it from a singular angle when trying to do so. You need to look at it from the angle of how much water funnels through this part of the flood plain over what period of time, and how to appropriately direct or redirect it. You do this by understanding the entire catchment at scale. It could well mean that some particularly interesting sub stadium drainage designs need to be used and that the stadium may need to be situated above the floodplain. Given that youre sinking footings, etc anyway, this is achievable and becomes a cost issue rather than a drainage issue. The problem comes down to cost for the stadium, and Kedron Brook as a whole is neither solved nor adversely impacted when the issue is properly and fully considered. Re BCC Flood Engineers - they're one piece in a larger puzzle where the constraints are not only financial, but also political, social, environmental, etc. Solving Kedron Brook is easy - remove the houses in the flood zone. But that's not achievable. Building a stadium above the flood height and providing adequate room underneath to redirect the flow is solvable, as is forming the land adequately so that access and egress is above the flood height. I never said it's cheap.
49. You realise they put on buses for events that go directly from woolloongabba to both ends of the busway/all directions? You don’t have to go to the city to go back South. The original plan was to realign the busway station so it’s not an offshoot anyway. You can also walk to Southbank and the city via the new green bridge in KP.
50. It's not just the stadium footprint they need. They'll need a forecourt and amenities. I dare say that the increase in house/apartment price is in line with everywhere else but a quick look shows that they certainly are not selling for 3 times the price they were a few years ago.
51. They’re selling at triple because all housing in bris has nearly doubled and somewhat affordable housing with proximity to the city (like apartments in my day) even more so
52. Why are 50k people walking around under the stadium? They are going to go from the stadium to the rail or bus connections. All of which are above flood height.
53. So all this infrastructure will have no impact on the flood levels on neighbouring properties? Have a quick look at the BCC flood awareness map. The site is affected by creek, river and overland flooding as is the wider area. Now imagine that scenario with an extra 50K+ in the area during a flood (not just walking around the stadium). It's a really shit idea.
54. Why would it? You're not increasing the area of hard surfaces. You're not raising the land form, and you're not putting anything into the water way. I can't see how it would impact any other area.
55. So the stadium just hovers above the flooded areas? I've been working in floodplain management for 20+ years. I've looked at heaps of situations like this. It won't work unless neighbouring properties are okay with water levels in their houses being higher than they are now. I mean, we all sit here and go "weren't the people who designed Brisbane fucked in the head when they put all the properties in a floodplain" and yet there are people in this thread going "Yeah, this site is fucked by flooding so we should build critical infrastructure on it" There are better uses for this land than a sports stadium. I can only assume anyone who wants this lives in the immediate area.
56. You would cut back the existing toombul carpark to lower the height to closer to the creek height, and then have the floor plate of the stadium on columns raised to the height of toombul station. This would increase the width of the flood area at the stadium location dropping the velocity dramatically and reducing flood impacts around it. The stadium would be miles above the flood line, as are all road and rail access points.
57. So, uh, water just hits the columns hey? Anyway, you'd need about a diameter of 300m to allow for a stadium of similar size to the new one in Perth. It's about that from Grace Street to the railway line, but there'd be a buffer from the rail line. So unless you want a super skinny stadium or to acquire private residential dwellings, it can't fit. It's just a really shit place to put critical infrastructure.
58. Yes. Like every single bridge over a waterway. And Perth stadium is 300 x 250. And the gabba's widest part is 250m including buildings. But I get it, you don't like the location. But there is nothing stopping it's construction there from an engineering perspective.
59. Anything can be constructed from an engineering perspective. You could possibly fit a stadium in there but you certainly couldn't fit in the forecourt area or anything else to attract people to the site. This site is only marginally better than having it at QSAC. At least that shit hole is on a hill.
60. In the nicest way possible, you might want to take your comments to the Townsville, Rockhampton, Sunshine Coast, Maryborough, or Hervey Bay subreddits instead. Brisbane and a good portion of the outer "Greater Brisbane" areas voted Labor, which stopped a total LNP landslide. So maybe it's time to go eat a crow—or whatever it is South Australians do.
61. You aren't here for a discussion clearly or you wouldn't limit the discussion to only people who agree with you. Don't see the point of this post at all
62. Some people are not social democrats and never will be, they firmly believe Australia is a strictly capitalist country. The idea of using taxes to ensure everyone is housed and fed, is anathema to them. They put business and strict economic prosperity above society. So they voted ALP out. Some of my friends honestly feel this way. I don't like it but there it is
63. So what is the point of this post for? Are you giving people here a lecture or what?
64. One could just as easily ask "*why the hell did you guys put Marshall in charge?*" (And if your response to that is "*we got rid of him as soon as we could*", I'll point out Qld did the same thing with Newman several years earlier.)
65. Maybe everyone's missing the point the blame here falls on the shoulders of Anastasia she fucked it up royally and ran away then someone else jump the que and said I can win and lost because she fucked it up royal it's on her and not one person in the news has pointed to her.
66. About a month ago I said how entertaining the cope from the fallout of Labor losing would be, and I've not been disappointed 🤣
67. We literally aren’t in control. It doesn’t matter who we vote for, powers at be wanted this to happen exactly how it played out. We just gotta ride the wave of dumbfuckery.
68. Never have I been more convinced than in this election, that votes simply do not matter. No reasonable person I have spoken to wanted them in charge, and I was immediately suspicious when I went to do my early voting and saw that the booths were once again only offering pencils to write with. You'd think we would have learned, but welcome to the most apathetic country in the world I guess.
69. I'm not taking my comments elsewhere, thank you very much. Just because it makes you uncomfortable doesn't mean you have to push it away.
70. > If you're going to comment "Go bother about your own state's politics", "Bugger off, you've got know business crying about our state government" Which one of those means "If you disagree with me?"
71. Ah yes, the ambulance rammer. I honestly keep forgetting that Marshall was in charge, he's just that forgetable lol. My mind goes Jay Weatherill... guy with glasses.. Malinauskas. Also, may I ask, what's the Newman lore? Or is it that politically traumatic? I wouldn't blame you, guy sounds like a c\*nt. Edit: Holy shit. What an embarassing, sad man. *Bootcamps??* You're kidding.
