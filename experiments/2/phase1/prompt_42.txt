Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Also for those area once is enough for home invasions, you can't expect people to lie around have their home invaded constantly while waiting for the program to take hold, there has to be a system to separate the repeat offenders away
2. Wanding powers come from "Jack's Law", which was introduced in 2023 after a fatal stabbing of a 17 years old. It warrants police to use metal detector wands on all public transport, including stations, and any area declared a "safe night" precinct. In August it was expanded to also include shopping centers, licensed premises, retail outlets and public events. The law was in response to the stabbing death of Jack Beasley at Surfers in 2019.
3. Crime is increasing as population is increasing faster, so that's technically crime going down (youth crime anyway), the only argument I didn't have the answers to was what are the actual crimes and at what point at the crimes added to the stats. Cause crime can go down, but if the crimes are worse then it's not really going down is it. So just hard to get all the correct info.
4. As did Crusifelli, your point? Edit: Obviously C--- is full of shit about it. I'm just pointing out to LNP fans criticising Miles that their own leader said this too.
5. The police beat in Mount Isa was burned down many years ago and to this day they operate out of a donga. There has been more then once instance of a cop car being stolen and taken on a joyride. Its entertaining to say the least.
6. We always hear about how close knit and supportive these communities are. So what’s going wrong in the communities themselves? Why aren’t they stepping in, why are kids going off the rails and where are the parents?
7. I’m not sure I’d call Russell Field a prop. He was obviously so affected by losing his son, his son’s partner and his unborn grandchild when they were hit by an 17 year old who was drunk, high and in a stolen vehicle, he’s decided to do something about it.
8. Yeah of course for people directly impacted it’s going to seem like it’s everywhere (because it happened to you!). That doesn’t mean that it actually is everywhere, it’s literally the definition of anecdotal. If we do want to lower youth crime, we know from studies and other countries that harsher sentences doesn’t work. A 13 year old about to steal a car isn’t going to stop because they are going to get 2 years in jail instead of 6 months - there brains aren’t developed enough to comprehend the consequences. Things that do work are early intervention and school lunches, but the LNP platform isn’t going to make the situation better - if anything will likely exacerbate the situation.
9. Half the population is below average intelligence. Everyone is overworked and stressed with the cost of living crisis. It’s the media’s job to report the truth and framed in a way to help people understand the truth. It’s not the media’s job to create fear in the community. Is youth crime in Queensland at a record low? Yes. Are there pockets of regional Queensland that has high youth crime? Yes. Will harsher sentencing have any tangible effect? No. Will early intervention and more community support help? Yes. What solutions are the major parties proposing and do experts agree?
10. Locking ppl up isn’t a complete fix but it’s a deterrence just like police alcohol testing or speed cameras. If there are no consequences imagine how bad the roads would get. It’s ridiculous to think harsher penalty would have no effect on youth crime (or any crime really).
11. Pretty much, at work theres an exective who went to NT in june, where a bunch of kids came up to the car asking for booze and cigaretts. He's brought it up everyday since he got back
12. I heard they’d dine their dough on trying to get Jonathan Sriranganathan in as Lord Mayor.
13. The outgoing police commissioner even said it was an issue and the new commissioner had a task force on it. Yet the ALP tried to run on a campaign of, “even though you’re telling us it’s a concern to you, you’re wrong and it’s not a problem.” Overall crime is down. Youths stealing cars in regional towns is up and a a genuine problem we need to solve.
14. Any idea why they didn’t? They had the facts instead of focusing on TikTok
15. Paragraph 11 He does support a woman’s right to choose. You were correct. https://amp.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/22/queensland-election-2024-lnp-abortion-policy-david-crisafulli
16. Its obviously a very complicated problem, and there's no singular cause or solution. Oftentimes the parents of these kids are absentee. Alot of them don't work, are on the dole and have substance abuse issues (alcoholics, mostly) and simply do not care where their kids are or what they are doing. Once when I was a teenager, I had a house party where a 14 year old kid stole hundreds of dollars out of my fathers wallet from his bed side table while he was sleeping. When we confronted the mother about this she told me the issue was between us and her son, she had nothing to do with it and she also had no idea where he currently was. Thats the reality for a lot of kids out that way. As for the community. What exactly is the community supposed to do? These kids are untouchable. One guy detained a child who broke into his home for the police to apprehend. Instead he was apprehended for illegally detaining a child (kidnapping essentially). My friends a high school teacher and she can not physically touch a student, even if that student is physically assaulting another student (which happens regularly). The biggest issue people out this way want addressed is the magistrates. The police do a fantastic job and have a high presence. However, all they can do is arrest these kids, put them Infront of a magistrate who lets them off with a slap on the wrist time and time again. These kids are emboldened to do crime, not even because they have to. But because its fun. And they 100% are guaranteed to get away with it. I don't know if you have ever spent any time in a small rural town, but when there's not a lot of stuff to do, taking a car for a joyride is an alluring prospect. Especially when there is no repercussions for doing so. Not from your family unit. And not from the state. Yes obviously addressing the underlying reasons of poverty and poor parenting is part of the solution. But introducing boundaries and enforcing those boundaries is important for any child's development. The current situation of allowing kids to commit crimes with impunity is part of the problem that needs to be addressed. A child should be scared of breaking into peoples homes and stealing there cars. They should face consequences for doing so. Currently they do not. Which is why they do what they do.
17. Isn’t this just a culture issue where parents should be responsible? If you can’t afford school lunches in the first place you really shouldn’t be pumping out kids. I know there are “exceptions” but it isn’t up to society to pay and feed for your kid just so he won’t go rob someone’s house, or worse violence even. And this is coming from someone who has a kid.
18. It's not a deterrent for underage kids who have no concept of losing the most formative years of their life to a concrete cell. It's not a fix at all *for them*. Every study around the world has concluded it's the worst option in lieu of dozens of other methods, and it's not going to make people find a bag of money under their bed. The problem is poverty, not short sighted thinking. Harsher punishments are a political strategy and a *sweep the problem under the rug* solution.
19. > genuine problem we need to solve. Except the LNP didn't offer anything even close to a solution, the methods and things that they put forward are the equivalent to dumping a few 44 gallon barrels of petrol on a fairly tame fire. "Tough on crime" has literally -never- shown to work or have a positive outcome.
20. "I support a woman's right to choose" Is completely incompatible with A) voting against it in 2018, and B) allowing a conscience vote, something he has refused to deny. How is it anything but lip service?
21. Yep. There isn't an easy way around any of it, I think the last thing people really want to see is literal kids doing hard time with real criminals. I suppose getting them in front of better role models would be a start, maybe get them into apprenticeships early, or find real work for them to do that has some kind of rewards and makes mucking up less appealing. Basically distract them from being shitheads, put them in a box with other shitheads and they'll just learn from each other.
22. The experts and other countries have shown harsher sentencing does not have any noticeable effect on youth committing crime. It’s not like they are going to break into a house because there is 3 months in jail, but we increase it to two years then they won’t? Their brains can’t fully understand the consequences of their actions (it grows until 25) and then you add malnutrition, drugs, trauma etc and of course they are going to make bad decisions. We should be trying to help them, not give cruel and unnecessary punishment by sending them off to re-education camps.
23. We should punish the child and let them go hungry because their parents made a bad decision? How heartless are you. To me as an Aussie “mateship” is a core part of that, but you are basically f*ck starving kids - not my problem. It is 100% up to society to make sure every child is cared for. If you die suddenly and your kid ended up in care, I would want them to be fed, educated cared for and loved. How do you not want that for other children?
24. Missing key details on repeat offenders and hardened criminals, prevention of reoccurrence till after deemed safe to reintegrate and assistance to victims of crime both financially and psychologically. It feels like lacking detail and depth, hard to pin it but it looks like an approach paper that will just get a C+ in uni.
25. Pfffttt.. I was elected to lead... not to read. (Most people - judging by your downvotes)
26. Saying you’ll be tough on crime and over correcting is still going to poll better than trying to tell voters that what they care about isn’t a real problem. I don’t agree with the LNP option, but I had people in this very subreddit shilling hard for ALP trying to tell me car theft isn’t a real issue, when I’ve lived in the same street for 20 years with no car theft for ~17 of them, multiple car thefts per year now. Have had cameras since 2011. 2011 - 2018, nothing. 2019 - now, multiple times per year I get indigenous kids checking our windows and doors in the early hours of the morning. They are not violent, they don’t smash in windows, they don’t steal valuable stuff like tools I’ve left out. They seem exclusively interested in cars, presumably for the purposes of hooning them. They even dumped one of my neighbours cars a block away from where they stole it, with some serious panel damage. I assume it’s for social media clout, but it’s a genuine problem and I have nil sympathy for the ALP losing. Telling the voters they are wrong in a representative democracy shows a stunning level of arrogance.
27. Hey man. Early term and late term are very different. 24 weeks is too late for an abortion under mine and my partners conscience. Which is our opinion. I respect yours even if it’s different than mine, A lot of children that are born at 24 weeks quite often survive. It’s worth checking out images and stats/studies of these children. Late term abortion is very different to banning it blanket. Women have a right to choose but at 24 weeks it’s an actual conscious human child and therefore also deserves a right to live. Before you write your next comment please explore some images of these children. They aren’t an undeveloped foetus they are children with a good chance of living outside of the womb and a lot of them do, wilful ignorance doesn’t help. Edited some mistakes my first language isn’t English sorry
28. Well considering that the current situation is youth offenders face no consequences for their actions, then respectably I have to disagree. The current situation is stealing a car and going for a joyride is done with no consequence. So kids do it because its a bit of fun. I argue that fewer kids would be willing to steal cars and go for joyrides if doing so would garner a 3month to 2 year jail sentence yes. I call bullshit on this harsher sentencing does not have any noticeable effect on youth committing crime rhetoric I keep hearing on this sub. I'm sure there is diminishing returns sure. But holding youth criminals accountable for their behavior each and every time forces intervention, and forces both the youth criminal to reconsider there actions, and there peers to. Also add on the fact that they simply cannot commit further crimes while detained, so at least rest of society is protected from there actions for some period of time. The current system of giving youth criminals a slap on the wrist and being sent on there merry way to reoffend with impunity IS the problem. Edit: I also call bullshit on this "there brain is still developing they cant make rational decisions rhetoric". Yes there brains are still developing. But a teenager is plenty old enough to know that breaking into a house and stealing cars is wrong. We don't give a 21year old a free pass to commit crimes because there brain is still developing. I don't see why we should give a 16year old a free pass.
29. Wouldn’t it be amazing if every child born on earth is happy and has all their needs met and we all just shit rainbows. All we talk about is more handouts to fix every problem. I’m just being realistic here and there’s a difference between tax payers funding every single state school kid food for eternity and targeting those who are in “need”.
30. I have worked, day in and day out, for YEARS with children born 24-26 weeks. Don't think for a second I'm underinformed here, I have a hell of a lot of first hand experience than you. I've bounced a kid on my lap while seeing pics of them in their first days, and seen the pride and joy in their parents faces, and seen how loved and valued they are. I would never, ever wish an unwanted child upon another person. I would never believe a woman's body should be forcibly used to gestate a fetus, much like I don't believe in forced live organ donation.
31. So if a woman is hemorrhaging at 37 weeks, what is the choice? Not every late termination is a wilful abortion
32. You can call ‘bullshit’ as much as you like to any facts that don’t agree with your views. It doesn’t make it any less true. Here are some sources if you are interested in educating yourself on the topic: https://lawcouncil.au/media/news/punishment-after-the-event-rarely-works https://yac.net.au/2023/01/30/stop-youth-crime-get-smarter-not-tougher/ https://www.sentencingcouncil.qld.gov.au/about-sentencing/sentencing-myths/myths-about-sentencing-children https://www.justicereforminitiative.org.au/why_locking_up_youth_offenders_fails_to_reduce_crime_and_what_we_should_be_doing_instead
33. Yeah it would be amazing and we should be aiming to get there! There are plenty of studies in America that trying to mean test lunches doesn’t work. It’s more expensive because you have to process and determine which kids need foods and which don’t. Then there is the economies of scale that it’s cheaper per child the more food is made so overall it is more cost effective. Also these social programs have shown for every $1 put in, society benefits $1.50 by having more educated population, less crime, frees up parents making lunches, creates new jobs and businesses. Then the negatives of making it needs tested is that negligent parents won’t fill in the necessary paperwork and again the child goes hungry. Then the stigma for the child and parents getting the food when it’s only for the ‘poors’ would be so upsetting, I know I would rather starve then for people to know I’m getting a handout. There are so many things governments waste money on, submarines we won’t own or get for 10 years, fossil fuel subsidies, international corporations avoiding tax, qantas bailout to pay for ceo bonus. If all kids can access a healthy lunch - I’m ok with that.
34. We are both working on assumed knowledge of eachother here which I apologise for in my previous statement. You have no clue about my experience about this issue which is first hand. I’m glad you say you have some experience around this. I apologise I have made you heated about our discussion! Are you implying 20 weeks - (5 months) isn’t a long enough time for someone to decide they do not want a pregnancy? Implying that women are stupid? Given that it takes 16 weeks for very obvious physical signs that someone is pregnant. I am confused what you are implying. There may be cases of pregnancy in which circumstances are different, in the case that they are this is where policy should exist to fill the gap to meet circumstance. Thanks for your response!
35. The problem with law is that often times it can’t navigate circumstance, This is one of the reasons why judges exist but unfortunately they still aren’t infallible. I never once said that every late term abortion is a wilful one and as far as I have seen the policy is advocating against WILFUL late term abortion. Obviously a scenario in which a medical emergency like that is occurring the mothers life would take precedence? It’s a difficult thing to discuss if we compare this to the trolley scenario for example. Many people would choose the life of a baby over the life of the elderly however the circumstances regarding this issue changes and therefore so does the answer making it complicated. Great thing for you to bring up and talk about Thanks for your response!
36. I probably sound like a right wing nutter saying this, which is strange because I'm usually the one arguing against the right wing nutters, but these "facts" and "studies" just don't stack up to the lived realities on the ground. I'm sure I could take the time to shift though the data and see how they came to the conclusions they came to, and why the opposite is happening in my local community. But at the end of the day the simple facts are this. In the past couple of decades youth crime laws have been relaxed. Policy such as sentencing as a last resort ect which has directly led to an increase in repeat offenders operating with impunity. I don't have a link handy I can share, but those are the actual facts, free for anyone and everyone who wants to spend time in these communities to experience firsthand.
37. "Policy should exist to fill this gap". What do you mean? Because IF abortion is morally wrong, then why would any of the following make it right? The "no exceptions even for rape and incest" crowd, while reprehensible, are at least logically consistent. How on earth could you create policy around these issues that wouldn't be either prohibitively gatekept or meaninglessly accessible? *Thanks for your response!* * Some people, including multiple women I know, have few symptoms and their body doesn't change in obvious ways. I had someone celebrate our late announcement with us at 20 weeks, not realizing she was two weeks ahead of me. * Someone in a DV situation may feel unsafe to test, unsafe to share, or unsafe to terminate. It may take some time to feel safe to do any of those, and "this can't be real" is a pretty powerful psychological process (especially in trauma). * It may take time for someone to have the resources to have an abortion including time, money, time off work, transport to where abortion is available, etc. This intersects with social factors too, so "free services incl transport and paid time off" is technically a policy that could mitigate just this one. But seriously if your first thought about later abortions is "indecisiveness", and your subsequent thought is "implying women are stupid", then I'm not sure you're the person to bother speaking with?
38. I’m not doubting your experience, and other anecdotal evidence from people in those communities were youth crime is rampart. But the facts are youth crime as a whole in Queensland is down so the ‘relaxed’ rules as you put it is working. Now are there communities were it isn’t working, Mt Isa, Cairns etc. Yes for sure. Let’s look for evidence based solutions to solve these issues, rather than a ‘gut’ intuition that severely punishing these children will solve the issue.
39. Abortion isn’t morally wrong and never stated such. There is a difference between early term abortion and late term abortion. I didn’t think I’d neee to make that distinction to someone who is as intelligent and experienced as yourself. I stated that my partner and I personally believe late term. 20 weeks. (5 months) is morally wrong. As children who are born then are conscious beings and not a foetus anymore. And who are you to decide whether this policy can’t exist and that it will “gatekeep” people? Which is another assumption. I must have missed you adding Policy drafting to your list of “first hand experiences” lol Victims of rape, Health issues and I’m sure other unlisted problems deserve to have circumstance exist within a potential policy for these exceptions in a late term abortion Late term abortion SHOULD’NT be allowed to people who are simply just unsure and so abort the child. These people exist. I know from “first hand experience” Again English isn’t my first language so I won’t apologise you make silly assumptions about the points I’m getting across. Thanks for your response!
40. I'd love to hear of any ideas of how a policy could work, that would grant access in those circumstances (without being so open that anyone can simply state they apply to them, making the exception meaningless)? You say those circumstances deserve exceptions, and I'm asking how that could possibly work... Given no other OECD country has figured out a practical way of legislating those exceptions in (without sweeping "mental health" exceptions, which are very broad as I'm sure you can appreciate). To put it another way, who are you to assume it's feasible when nobody else seems to have managed to? Are you able to find any ideas, or just float "think of the babies!" imagery and argue with no anchor to reality? I'm not heated at all by the way, so direct messaging me Headspace's number... would be amusing, if it wasn't so disrespectful to the important work they do.
41. You seem to be assuming that women spontaneously decide “you know what I just don’t want this anymore let me go get an abortion” and I can tell you confidently that it isn’t a thing to get a spontaneous late-term abortion. As the person above said there are many different reasons psychological, psychosocial, physical, some cases are the chances of survival are slim for the mother or baby. The mother has to make that extremely tough decision and having people like yourself judging just makes it harder on women that have to go through with it, you can have your opinion but it’s still judgemental when these women need compassion in these situations.
42. Who knows, that comment about the probate sector could mean anything.
43. It would be *ideal* if they - fixed the 2 year lag on public housing allocation - granted tenders to flatpack developers to build more medium priced homes especially apartments -built over corner shops and train stations - built UP instead of out - join forces with Councils to resume land sold for development projects. Some have been delayed by greedy companies who just delay and delay with stupid excuses There is more than enough demand for everyone to profit and to ensure everyone has a home
44. https://preview.redd.it/7roo8evoz7xd1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=921d67757b3880c9536b4b5846092b57cfdd9d91 Basically, further increases in value of property in Brisbane (especially existing dwellings on large lots) as demand increases, decrease in value of property in the regions as supply increases
45. They’re scrapping stamp duty to entice first home buyers and replacing it with annual land tax. So take that how you will.
