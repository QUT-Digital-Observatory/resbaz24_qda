Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. Because any Labor or Greens candidate wouldn’t be caught dead speaking to these people that they view as beneath them. That’s why they vote KAP, LNP and One Nation. Those candidates go out, speak to them and form a personal connection. So whilst some of their policies don’t directly align with helping them, they’ll vote for the person who actually treated them like a person
2. that's an entire decade ago. in 2023 just over 50% of people voted online with no issue.
3. Your time is up. The age of LNP dominance is upon us.
4. My thoughts are, the reduction of youth crime is great, but the dramatic increase in specifically youth violent crime needed immediate intervention. No one is caring if a kid has a bit of weed or steals a can of coke, gangs of kids walking around with knives and stealing cars is flat out unacceptable.
5. They’re limiting bureaucracy getting in the way of starting & running small businesses. They’re also opening up more government tenders for small business to compete for.
6. we are at 0.5% counted, way too early to determine trends, because these counts could just becoming from specific polling places that lean one way or another, i don't deny that the LNP is very likely getting into Government, i fully expect and accept it will happen, but at least wait until like 30% count before calls are being made
7. Yer. free shit at the finish line after destroying everything else for the last 9 years. is the LNP responsible for the KAP? who knows what batshit stuff KAP is going to put forward, that argument can be made about any topic you care to dwell or be concerned on. And when you may need to work with said crossbench in a minority government (not likely at present) why would you come out and antagonise anything. Have you seen politics. and when did labor release all their costings? you will find it was the same day. And no, the LNP do not need to submit a budget as they werent in power. Feel free to bookmark this reply and if abortion is re-criminalised I will provide proof and buy a membership to the Labor party. Here, watch as many times as you need to.

8. I agree. I think the immediate drive to win government and the idea that they’ll deal with the result later will override everything. Might be a good thing longterm if LNP wins and might reduce their chances of winning a second term
9. No idea. But where does a 9% increase in crime come from? Old people breaking out of nursing homes and stealing cars?
10. The net position will likely be the same because LNP will cut the coal royalties and Qlders will not have aynthing to show for it.
11. Taking a hit in the short term to help out the future generation. Wow, what a degenerate governemt /s
12. I’m not sure you are responding to the same person. You should get it right when you are swearing at people
13. Lol sure, tell yourself whatever makes you feel better right now. Reality is Labor are capital G Gone right now.
14.

15. What are you going to say in 1 year? “I was right! I’m a clairvoyant.”
16. Deb? Her family farm is about 2h from us. She understands it. It's hard, whether it's because Labor know they won't win out here, or the Liberals take us for granted. Being able to get direct answers as to why our drought assistance was cut, or why the livestock export laws change. Brisbane doesn't give a shit. You're looking for some cookie cutter rationale, I'm all ears as to what you think is the solution to fix family farms.
17. Yeah sure, except you commented, then replied (and contradicted yourself). Enjoying Rogan tonight bro?
18. >Because any Labor or Greens candidate wouldn’t be caught dead speaking to these people that they view as beneath them. Projection
19. Sun's too hot up there. Fries a lot of braincells. Explains all the bigots and racists. Is that the personal connections you're talking about?
20. ....that we know of. Physical voting is always going to be safer and more secure than electronic voting. Whether the degree to which that is the case is worth the hassle is a matter of opinion. But personally, as someone who's spent a career in software development, I cannot come up with a realistic scenario in which I would trust an online voting system with something as important as an election
21. Are you trolling or can you actually not produce an answer that says something that means anything
22. Oh wow I don't really understand the details here can you explain further! I'm a small business/sole trader myself so this could really benefit me
23. Oh I’m not making a call, but I find it interesting that there’s not a single electorate swinging left so far.
24. Looks like 66% of voters pre polled. that’s massive. Pre polling is bad for the incumbents…
25. Crime can come from anywhere. Doesn't have to be carjacking or break and enters.
26. Or, look at this government facing an electoral wipeout borrowing to fund big vote buying promises.
27. I didn’t actually contradict myself even if you hope, and maybe even perceived that I did. Still, it’s just a joke sweety, sit down. Yeah I listened to some of it, but way too much for me, interesting though. Looks like he’s set to win the presidency again so I look forward to those meltdowns next week
28. Your inability to understand why people don’t think exactly like you is astounding. Leave your inner city echo chamber for a bit
29. Sounds like you’re passive aggressively trying to make a point but like.. why not just say what you wanna say
30. You're reaching aren't you? "Unlawful use of a motor vehicle" in Townsville increased by 16% in the last year. Look, I don't agree with this "adult crime, adult time" nonsense either, but you need to be honest about it and accept that crime has blown out in Townsville, and that the increase is largely driven by indigenous youth.
31. I don't live in a city. Is that so hard to believe? And your first sentence? Again, look in a mirror. I don't understand why you think centrists look down on others. They typically have empathy. Which is typically not something a rightist displays a lot. In fact, they actively disdain "city people". You included. Stop dividing "city" from non-city. *Everybody* deserves respect, services, empathy, personal choice, their own believes, their own identities, healthy environments, a liveable world, and so on.
32. Happy Cake Day! I look forward to brighter future, let's see how they do.
33. But sadly, this reflects the depth to which many people understand party policies when they vote 🥲
34. Where are you pulling these stats from, exactly? I'd like to read. Could you chuck us a link?
35. Bribery is easy to spot. Especially when you end up paying for it
36. Thanks haha. I’m nervous too. Fingered crossed they don’t fuck over the state.
37. I’m excited for the crack down on youth crime personally. Hopefully vulnerable members of society feel safe in public places and on public transportation. 😊
38. So a cost of living measure is bribery. Got it.
39. It is the government’s responsibility to borrow to support people when the economy is down. But don’t pretend that they aren’t borrowing.
40. If Miles wins I’ll eat my hat. And then celebrate.
41. at the very least I hope the swing back to Labor scares the shit out of the LNP and they do the right fucking thing I'd like to be able to look my daughter in the eye tomorrow
42. Again, surely they can’t publish this prior to polls closing
43. As a stinky Victorian, I really hope this current lead for LNP is a false dawn. All this hard work put forward by Steven Miles for your state is amazing and wish our premier had the same set of balls as him.
44. I mean watch the results unfold live on the TV now.
45. I’m hopeful for a very strong showing from Labor but am expecting a LNP victory. What I’m most interested in though is how much gloating the rabid LNP supporters, who clearly have voted against their own interest, get up to here on reddit.
46. I really hope so. I have voted for over 15 years. First time I am so invested in an election. I hope Labor wins. I am astounded that this is a Courier mail article.
47. Early voting is like 42% of all votes or something. Don't think election day is going to save Labor, as much as I'd like it.
48. Maybe it’s the echo Chambers of Reddit, but I’ve yet to see a positive campaign policy from LNP. Why are so many people voting liberal?
49. Omg this sub would have you believe labor were 90-10 in the polls 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
50. I work in a kitchen in a major metro hospital. I am literally sick with anxiety. I'm going to stop watching the election feeds, go drink and play Diablo 4 until dawn. I genuinely can't handle any more of this shit right now.
51. I don't bet, I thought about it for once, damn!
52. Moving forward the courier mail should be giving non bias media coverage of things instead of publishing certain items which sways the public opinion.
53. The vote rigging must be kicking in. Cant say I have much faith in state and federal elections. Too easy to change the results on a computer
54. Nah current polls look like QLD is getting Newman'd again, suck it!
55. If your hat is leather then it's mostly protien and water! (And tanning chemicals)
56. What sort of sauce does one employ for this? A good BBQ or go a little off the rails with a seafood sauce?
57. Hopefully not too chewy - postal votes still to come.
58. Best prepared in a smoker with hickory or apple wood.
59. Just do not go back and retrieve it after escaping the lion’s den!
60. I don't imagine they expect more then the one term either way, so they won't be paying attention to the swing and will be focused on implementing religious extremism and cash for mates policies while they can. Slash and burn economics and social policy is all they know.
61. > LNP and they do the right fucking thing Narrator: They did not. The feds were like "hmm am I out of touch? No, the voters are wrong. We need to be more batshit insane"
62. A swing back from what? Labor are in power, any further swing towards Labor would mean an increased majority for Labor. Are you confusing the variations in polls as a swing towards either party? Any swing can only be calculated after the count has been completed and compared to the result of the previous election.
63. Exit polls aren't the results, it's just normal polling but done in person at the polling booths. It's still subject to many of the same kinds of limitations as other polling methods.
64. they make their own rules could also be to generate headlines to manipulate any late voters
65. it can still be wrong as well it is just sample only
66. > **Exit poll shockwaves: Labor surges, election too close to call** > > An exclusive Courier-Mail exit poll of 2000 voters across 10 crucial seats reveals Labor and the LNP are neck and neck as voting closes in the 2024 Queensland election. > > The Queensland election result will come down to the wire, as exclusive exit polling reveals the two major parties are neck-and-neck as voting closes. > > The Courier-Mail polled 2000 voters as they cast their ballots at a cross-section of electorates today, with the final tally revealing 33.9 per cent of voters had backed the LNP, while Labor was just 0.3 points behind with 33.6 per cent of the vote. > > The results show an incredible comeback for the Miles Government, who trailed 48-30 in The Courier-Mail’s first exit poll, conducted on October 14. > > The latest Newspoll, released on Thursday, had Labor on 33 per cent of the vote, compared with 42 per cent to the LNP. > > Despite leaked Labor polling this week tipping Katter’s Australian Party winning Mundingburra, in Townsville, today’s exit poll showed the LNP and ALP ahead with equal votes. > > Of the 200 people polled across the seat both Labor’s Les Walker and the LNP’s Janelle Poole had 75 votes (37.5 per cent), while KAP’s Michael Pugh picked up 31 votes (15.5 per cent) and 14 people (7 per cent) voted for Rebecca Haley from the Greens.

67. Really? Like what? I’m enjoying the electricity rebate but what would be really great is if they would fix they state highway that was destroyed in Cyclone Jasper so I don’t have to worry about the one rickety lane that is still open almost one year later with no repair, that will probably get washed away in the next wet season. Labor is fucking great until you live with the reality of bureaucracy and inaction.
68. Can't be worse than the incessant Labor supporters over the last 6 weeks.
69. Doesn't that also apply to ALP supporters with gloating if labor formed government ? Because I know without a doubt this subbreddit would be really going hard at it with the gloating if labor won government. `who clearly have voted against their own interest` People vote what they find good what parties throw out what affects them etc, who are you to tell someone that they are voting against their own interest just because you find the party you're voting for is better and that everyone else should follow suite.
70. that is a good point, I am not sure many people took much notice in it, as it was not ever going to be close and they did not really change throughout the campaign
71. The LNP received more funding than every other party combined, paid by coal companies who don't want to pay the state for profiting from its resources. They do it because it works, and people who own their own home are scared of change.
72. No it didn’t. LNP were expecting a landslide, and the election is close. Doesn’t meant they expect Labor to win, just they are surprised that’s it’s closer than they thought it was going to be.
73. It's still too close to call, both parties can still get to 40.
74. Forgot the election rigging! Sorry, 'I mean ending the corrupt voting system' of preferential voting.
75. if they take a party postion that's opposed to changing the law and not allowing a conscience vote i don't see why the electorate would have an issue with it if they end up with abortion banned they are fucked for another 10 years which is terrible for democracy
76. Yep and if they do, we move. We can fucking protest and we can kick them out next election.
77. a swing from the absolute landslide that was expected no less than a month ago its obviosuly clear there had been a huge shift back to Labor in the last month thanks to one Robert Katter. Call it whatever you want but that's just somantics all in all its very interesting
78. yeah its still a prediction, hell while i doubt many would do it, you could just say you have voted for someone, but actually voted for someone else and they won't know
79. It is but it also but a lot of the limitations are removed when your exiting polling. As you can a lot of the response biases from how you go about finding people to poll.
80. Yes but publishing anything that can affect the outcome of the election is interference. You cannot just publish articles in the days before the election with the intent to affect the election result
81. Where do they dig up these people to interview? The school teacher who can’t do basic research on crime stats and one who called her Mummy (her Mummy is a twit!) who told her who to vote for. My head hurts.
82. What exactly is he going to change for the better? Cause repealing mining taxes is a right fuckwad move and so is denying qld kids free lunches.
83. Stop repeating shit and think for yourself for a change
84. This wasn’t written 4 weeks ago. It was literally 4 *hours* ago.
85. Little high proof polar bear marinade, 2 minutes a side on the bbq and finish with a good bbq sauce and some chopped chilli.
86. Newman's government didn't touch abortion, but they still fucked themselves for 9 years.
87. It all depends on how hard they are pushed by bob and if they take their pre election position seriously. Personally I feel it's not worth gambling when it comes to bodily autonomy, but maybe they will be better than we expect.
88. But that is the entire Courier Mail reason for existence - to publish articles in the lead up to elections to influence the result. It’s literally the only reason they still exist.
89. How is this different to any other published poll? Remember that digital media isn't included in the blackout.
90. Considering they have quite a significant reach among some demographics, I would have hoped they’d be much more careful about how they exert their influence so close to an election.
91. yeah I had a bit of a giggle at that one
92. And their number plates proclaim Queensland as the smart state!
93. Yeah, at least the states have mining taxes. We should have had a federal general mineral resource rent tax, but no.
94. Stop the unions ruling QLD is the first thing that'll happen.
95. I have been thinking for myself. Repealing coal royalties and and kids free lunches are terrible moves.
96. No tears here. The barracking for political parties where they are essentially the same on any major issue is what's silly. We will wake up tomorrow and nothing will change. Team red will be upset if they lose, team blue will be upset if they lose. The whole thing is dumb.
97. Damn that’s kinda making me hungry to eat a hat lol
98. my hope is the swing is the wake up call they need to pull their heads out of their asses the act result as well as this is pretty clear people what the ultra ring wing shit to fuck right off I'm prolly giving them for too mcuh credit though
99. It’s no different. If you have significant reach, you shouldn’t release anything on election day that might affect people’s voting intentions. I’m shocked how blasé Courier are about this
100. How does that help the majority of working class people? Strong unions is why we have great wages and better working conditions.
101. Hey, so do you know what a union is? You understand they’re DEMOCRATIC right? The assertion that they run anything is actually moronic.
102. Well you echoed an LNP slogan so I assumed you voted for LNP
103. > The barracking for political parties where they are essentially the same on any major issue is what's silly. like you do here champ? > No nurses were sacked under newman you twit. I have a good friend that is a nurse and there isnt a nurse in the state that wants a job and cant find one. > Newman never sacked anyone. They were redundancies and almost none of them from frontline staff. Australia has a disproportionate amount of people employed within the health industry relative to other OECD countries. Its not that we need less nurses, we need less bureaucracy and administrators. and here: >Despite LNP saying they wont do anything? > Despite abortions taking place in QLD for literally decades pre 2018? > the decimalisation was really just a formality by the time it was passed as law? > But listen to Labor and media lackeys and you have images of women having to carry babies to term if they were raped, and mothers and doctors thrown in jail for performing an abortion.... Its fear porn for middle class suburbanites who think the handmaidens tale was a documentary. that sure seems like barracking for a political party champ. how deeply embarrassing for you lol
104. I suppose it'll depend on if they are thinking long or short term. I can't say I've much or any faith in their long term thinking or ability for basic empathy, but I'd happily be surprised.
105. Oh a moral argument that they *shouldn't* publish anything like this. Yeah they DGAF.
106. You are literally retarded if you think the CFMEU is in any way democratic. It's a mob.
107. Oh the LNP... what exactly have they said they are going to repeal? I missed it and can't find anything online
108. I said REPEALING mate. Of course a tax on mineral extraction and free school lunches are great things. I mean who could possibly and honestly think they are not.
109. Won't lie mate, I've had a bit to drink, and I'm a tad emotional about the prospect of an LNP gov. I apologize for misreading your comment, I shouldn't have said anything at all. Something I need to work on. My fault.
110. I was talking about the CFMEU, so yes, we are talking about the CFMEU and the powers that they were allowed to run riot with.
111. Don’t worry mate. Have a good night, we’ll see what happens tomorrow!
112. Haven't thought of that one - but we've already ordered the pizza to be delivered this evening so we can watch Antony Green and the live coverage on ABC which is what my wife and I have been doing for years on election nights!
