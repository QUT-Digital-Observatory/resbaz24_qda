Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. You do realise that if CPI fell to below 1%, the ACT’s rent cap would mean a *lower* increase than the QLD Greens fixed/predictable 1% proposal… right? So again - why are rent caps “batshit insane” and “not realistic” when the exact scenario, and even lower rent increases, can and does happen in another part of Australia where it is already law? The fact it can already occur under the ACT’s rent cap shows it is not unrealistic.
2. No it wasn’t close to a landslide. Was a net 3% gain. Labor has 30 seats. Campbell Newman left Labor with 7 seats. That’s a landslide mate. 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
3. People have no qualifications in anything but in a democracy everybody gets a vote and voice. Their economic policies are sound policies, just unpopular culturally because the average voter is stupid and doesn't understand economics and still cling to the idea they're temporarily frustrated millionaires when the growing class wealth divide driven by the shadow of neoliberalism is a pyramid scheme bursting apart.
4. 100% wrong. This is the line the big two parties throw around to keep themselves in power. You know who actually runs the country? Civil servants: people who got their jobs by virtue of actually having the relevant skills, as opposed to a bunch of suits who won a popularity contest. Ask anyone who's worked in government and you'll hear story after story of good policy drafted by civil servants being quashed or rewritten into something unrecognisable by politicians because it went against party ideology or the request of some lobby group that funded the winner's last election.
5. Once billionaires get done with buying most of the farm land like they are in the US at least we won’t have to hear these regional farmers whinge.
6. Weird, because it was a central talking point of my local candidate, who was the member for your area and what did they talk about then?
7. Healthcare is a public service, no different to public transport or libraries, not exactly the back bone of socialism
8. Yeah agree. In her seat she couldn’t move the needle which is exactly what is needed to win the seat.
9. That’s ridiculous. Firstly, as a party they have been very anti war, this isn’t new for them. Secondly, even if they hadn’t, it’s a straw man argument, just because someone hasn’t criticised a war doesn’t mean they can’t speak out about 40,000+ people dying. Governments shouldn’t be immune to criticism and no one should be ok with innocent people dying regardless of their religion, skin colour, etc.
10. >If they were critical of all current wars we are? wtf lmao
11. I didn't think you were antagonistic to it. My point is that it doesn't just impact women and legalisation isn't everything. And I don't think it was the main reason (not even close) as to why the Greens tanked. If anything they were aligning themselves with the same sentiment that helped oust the coalition at the federal level. More likely, it came down to changed Labour/Liberal preferences and what the greens have been doing at the federal level. I'm confused about the downvotes. Care to elaborate, nameless downvoters?
12. Ya know we don't lock up people for life for most crimes yeah?
13. Democracy is rule by the majority. Also, preferential voting ensures that a true majority is established. A vote for the Greens is a vote for Labor in reality. But when the Greens win 1 seat in a hung parliament, it's anti democratic because the 10000 people in that electorate who voted for the Greens have power over policy for let's say, 27 million people. That is what the Greens are: Anti democratic because they aim for the balance of power. Why should a party with 9.8% of the vote in QLD have any say on policy? Tonight's result of 0 Green seats is democratically fair. It will happen in the federal election as well.
14. It absolutely is. Saying it's not is ignorant on how power work.
15. Agree. Former greens voter in South Brisbane, now vote for ALP. Definitely don’t feel like Amy represented the area well. When I wrote to her saying I as a constituent would support the Gabba rebuild & relocation of the school I received condescending replies from staffers. Stopping the relocation of the school seems to be her only priority for the area and it impacted such a small amount of people (and the disingenuous “don’t close out school” slogans were ridiculous given a brand new school was to be opened). They are against high density redevelopment in the cross river rail site (if not there, where??) I don’t feel like she achieved anything in 4 years. There was no vision I was aware of. In comparison Jackie Trad worked to get a new high school (BSSSC) for the area, was instrumental in getting the abortion bill for Queensland women, cross river rail etc.
16. That is some ass backwards logic. If you're voting for The Greens you obviously don't want a majority Labor government dude.
17. What do you mean by help their primary vote? What difference does that make?🤷🏼‍♂️
18. Yes, I know, but that assumes that the LNP don’t overtake Labor to enter the top two. It’s explained in more detail on the ABC results page.
19. > maybe Rudd will come back lol I want to subscribe to this timeline...
20. Political parties can care about more than one or a few things through. I saw much more shared about the other big issues they want to tackle. It wasn’t there main policy/argument. Just one of many.
21. Um, ok, the question was asked, why? So I guess some people care. If you don’t, just scroll on.
22. I hardly think so, they have decimated Gaza and have moved onto Lebanon.
23. If either side put down all their weapons they would die, it’s not a black and white conflict
24. Even without putting their weapons down, Israel has stolen/taken most of what was part of Palestine. Palestine is now just two little territories walled off almost like an open air prison. So what do you think would happen if they put their weapons down? There would be nothing left of Palestine.
25. > Yup. But it's not a state issue. I mean it absolutely is if you care about all your constituents. > This is where the greens fuck up IMO. They focus too much on big issue social stuff at the lower levels. Can you show a single Greens candidate who made this their primary platform position, and not just one of many things that they talked about? > People can't afford food, they don't have the energy to care about Gaza Damn, if only literally every Greens candidate -did- have this as their primary talking point, along with a set of policies to actively address the issue as opposed to the LNP who have..?
26. > how would a Greens MP have ANY influence over the issue in Israel / Palestine. I mean you don't have to ponder, they've directly stated it on their website and via their policies? There's absolutely things we could be doing.
27. No I'm using my big theory words to describe the interactions where someone correctly identifies micro aggressions and moments of intersectional bigotry and chooses to push back on them. That's not my focus when I'm doing politicking but has been my experience watching Green politicking at more grassroots levels. I'm happy to talk about them, I just don't find it useful to push back on someone calling me ma'am or miss unless it's an environment where they are devaluing my education. Using normative forms of address or even the wrong one (I do get male ones sometimes) is less on my agenda than talking about environment and listening, or youth crime, or whatever.
28. Pre-polls and postals are already counted in Maiwar (a small number still to come). Not sure what the ABC computer is doing but other projections reckon the Greens hold on.
29. > When people are struggling to put food on the table or pay their rent the Greens issues are not going to be a priority for the average person just wanting some day to day relief and to feel safe and listened to. Uhh, so you just have 0 idea on the Greens positions or policies then? Because this is literally a key part of their platform.
30. So when we were talking to voters in Maiwar we would pivot the conversations about the cost of rent, if it can up as a concern, to how the greens were blocking this bill. We would explain that the first home owners grant helps that one family but increases housing prices for everyone else and is tailored to new homes being built on the urban fringe not helping people buy in their local area, amongst their community. People are angry at the expectation that to be able to afford a home they should have to move out of the city they grew up in. Most of these renter wants to be a home owner, having a realistic path of getting there. It was pretty effective showing people that their local member was working to stop them being able to have a home.
31. You still need to gather numbers for how many and where people are using the system so you can allocate resources effectively. Having a minimal payment means you use the existing infrastructure instead of spending extra to retrofit the network with cameras or sensors to do the same job.
32. Because anything you don't pay for gets treated (by a small but still meaningful minority) like shit. Of all the people who behave like scum on the bus, how many pay for their fare? ZERO.
33. I don’t care about it. Things will be 3% different for most people. It’s not like we are all being carted off to a concentration camp. The way some people carry on is ridiculous.
34. Assuming you voted for the Greens? who support Hezbollah, pretty disturbing as well
35. Their economic policies are sound eh. Freeze rents, guarantee renewals, cap grocery prices, provide and pay for breakfast and lunch at schools… They seems to have forgotten how a free market economy works (and they are blithely ignoring what happens when you kill off the ‘free market’ part), and, they also seem to have forgotten that you need to, you know, pay for stuff that you as a government provide.
36. Says the civil servant. Mate nice try but policy is directed by politicians. Civil servants are their lackies. I work with governments. The Minister is their master.
37. Get out of the city brosef. The smog is clogging your mind's grip on reality. "Quick get me my alfoil hat and a latte, the farmers are coming for me!!! Ahhhh!!! I can smell their evil on the wind!!! Won't someone call the billionaires, they'll save me!!! "
38. And neo liberals love to gut public services. Medicare is socialised healthcare by definition. When you use the words "public service" you essential define a socialist service. It is a proud Australian facet that I'm sure most of us champion
39. And a democracy has a right to self defence and that's why they lost my vote
40. Once you see the bigotry and authoritarianism on the left, it does shake you
41. Given the course on crime and economy I choose economy, wished Labor won but greens has to be last with their proposals
42. 9.8% of a state of millions is not a small number. Why shouldn’t they have a say on policy? Hard to see how that is anti-democratic if a majority government of less than 50% of the total votes is fine. But also - government should reflect the will of the voters. If voters refuse to grant a majority to a party, they don’t get a majority government and there can be a contest for the balance of power. It’s exactly how democracy works.
43. If something fails to pass parliament because 43 LNP politicians and 1 Green politician votes against it, it's solely the 1 Green politician's fault? That's some wild logic.
44. the last time we had a hung parliament was the most successful period in Australian history https://australiainstitute.org.au/post/what-happens-when-independents-hold-the-balance-of-power/
45. The relocation of the school is inevitable. The facility can no longer cater to the modern education of primary school students especially in sports, is surrounded by 3 major thoroughfares, has no pick up or drop of zones and the building is past its used by date. To keep fighting for an unwinnable cause is simply a waste of time, because sooner or later a viable solution has to be found.
46. Most people I know who vote Green preference labor second with the intent to try to push labor left of centre.
47. have a look at the greens voting card next time
48. Am ALP member in a safe ALP seat, I voted 1 greens, 2 weed and 3 ALP because when the preferences get reviewed it informs future policy decisions to remain left or move further left to try and recapture those first preferences. I find it utterly hilarious how terrified ALP is of the greens, at branch meetings and at convention they carry on more about the greens than LNP
49. Last federal election Labor got a relatively low primary vote despite winning government which suggests that they're not people's first choice. As a greens voter part of my vote is about pushing Labor to the left. If Labor look at their preference flows and see greens votes getting them over the line they might go OK we need to speak to these voters. I feel like Miles understood this and put out policies to keep the city seats - it worked for them. You can see their primary vote is quite strong. I love that preferential voting let's you communicate so much with your vote tbh.
50. It's insane how hard preference voting is for people to understand.
51. He has too many millions of dollars and properties to be seen as a champion of the people these days. Smart guy though. Did some good things.
52. Israel has just proved that up to the point of the terror attacks last year they were being restrained, now they have had enough and are showing what they could have done but never did all those years. If the Palestinians could do what Israel is doing now they would have done it first chance they got. The left leaning people are literally the epitome of the frog and the scorpion fable, the Palestinians literally support none of your causes they would kill all the gays and trans, have zero advocation for women’s rights have the complete opposite views on everything you stand for, you’re the frog carrying the scorpion across the river…
53. QLD state politics is not the place for it. Move on
54. Before we go any further, I voted #1 for the greens. We're almost certainly on the same side where we want the Greens to have more power in the government and I feel you're using pretty combative language which isn't going to help convince anyone. With that said. >It's not a state issue I stand by this. It's a federal issue because states are not the level of government that deal with international relations. The federal Greens members can care for this kind of stuff. They have the exact same constituents as the local members. Direct your effort appropriately. >Can you show a single Greens candidate who made this their primary platform position They don't need to make it Primary, they need to not give the media any soundbites that allows them to run with negative greens stories. It's the reality of being a part of a party that has the media landscape already set against you. Take [this story](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-04/brisbane-councillor-trina-massey-refund-newsletter-gaza/104304744) from the local election as an example of how their strategy can backfire. Nobody thinks the Greens are for genocide, they don't need to keep mentioning it. >Damn, if only literally every Greens candidate -did- have this as their primary talking point, Correct, and this is where the Greens need to really hammer home their strengths. Unfortunately they're complex issues and the Greens spend a lot of effort trying to explain their complex solutions. They do a lot of stuff like door knocking, which is great if you're only trying to win a few select seats. But if they want to grow, they need their messaging strategies to grow too. Let's take the LNP "Adult Crime Adult Time". A simple message that is easy to remember, but it doesn't really explain much. So if you are interested in more, you look it up. Otherwise, you just take it at face value and move on. The Greens could've tried running a message like "Crime Prevention, not Crime Reaction" to get people interested in what that means, and then had easily available resources to explain it. If the Greens focused on making simpler messaging, then I believe they'd have a much more successful time in growing their vote.
55. Lol, oh yeah and what could little old Australia do on the world stage of what's happening? "Stop! Or I'll say stop again!... I warn ya!". We can't do shit and are completely under the rule of whatever America is doing, it's as simple as that.
56. >Uhh, so you just have 0 idea on the Greens positions or policies then? Because this is literally a key part of their platform. If that is true, then clearly the Greens didn't do a good enough job at getting their message across.
57. > You still need to gather numbers for how many and where people are using the system so you can allocate resources effectively. Ok, and? People could still just tap their go card but have nil charge, this is a literal non-existent problem/justification.
58. So because of the behaviour of an almost negligible minority you think we shouldn't push for free public transport? Logic like that it's no wonder the LNP won.
59. A free market economy is never meant to be run laissez-faire my guy. During times of economic crisis where the market has failed, you absolutely intervene with hard controls to support people. Also, in times of crisis you borrow and run into deficit to support the populace. We've had 3 years of consistent surplus, we're fine.
60. Neither are relevant a hundred years later WW2 for all it's horror gave us universal healthcare, nothing to do with socialism
61. That’s fine. You have the right to vote how you wish, my point was just that it’s dangerous to call criticism of Israel antisemitism. Government should be held to account.
62. 9.8% is not a majority. Simple as that. You may not like it but that is the numbers game. The will of the voters should not sit with a minority party who represent a small percentage of the population. That is exactly against democracy. Democracy is everyone gets a say, the majority rule. Not everyone gets a say and... Because the it's a tie, the party with the least votes decides. Reality is a numbers game. That's why the Greens failed, as they should.
63. Agree. If it hadn’t been used as a political wedge issue the greens would be screaming for a school with more green space away from major roads.
64. Exactly! It has absolutely nothing to do with it at all.
65. People refusing to actually read up and learn about political parties is their failing, what was the LNP's messaging and why was it so successful then?
66. Pretty much all Government decision-making is based on "how will bogans abuse this?", which is why we can't have nice things as a society anymore.
67. It's why low fare is a good idea and free is a bad idea. But don't worry, Green supporters invoking logic will never fail to amuse.
68. Net debt of $25b and you’re out here pointing at a couple of tiny, manufactured “operating surpluses” wanting to spend piles more. Ok m8
69. lmao, this is why you need to read Das Kapital
70. Destroying the banking system, collapsing our industries, unchecked migration policies, policies that will dig us deeper into debt than the other parties, blocking housing developments. Lots to list but then again it wouldn't matter because it won't change your opinions about the greens and I won't either. I'll just vote the way I want to
71. 40% also isn’t a majority - no party has a majority in the primary votes. I’m not saying 9.8% should have a mandate, but neither should a government that isn’t given a majority by the people. It’s why we have minor parties, to negotiate and compromise and be more democratic. Flawed system though, but not for the reasons you mention. 9.8% having no say in parliament except in where their preferences flow to may not be an ideal system.
72. His wife did. He was just a poor boy from Nambour.
73. >People refusing to actually read up and learn about political parties is their failing Lol, seriously, it's the audience's fault the message wasn't conveyed adequately?
74. I still have no idea what you are on about. You might want to get some help.
75. And we’re back to the start. Show me the antisemitism? Do you even know what that word means?
76. And you've read the specific policy documents and researched it all yeah?
77. I lived that election champ. Ain't no Greens involved. The Greens are a weed to Australian politics. They stand for nothing so do not deserve the balance of power if it were to occur. Their low primary vote is 2% above One Nation so are in the same "loopy extremist" basket to the majority.
78. This is going to shock you, but conveying the entirety of an entire platform of policies is literally impossible if your policies have anything approaching substance to them, yes. But please answer my question, what was the LNP's messaging and why do you think it was so succesful?
79. Pointless game to play, don't try and pretend to be passive. You attacked first claiming my vote was disturbing. Get bent hippy.
80. which is why no one will ever take you seriously not my fault if you refuse to understand the basic principles of free market economy & government assistance
81. If you don't agree with the IDF atrocities you are anti semitic. /s
82. Are they protesting Turkey bombing the Kurds, Assad bombing his own people, the war in Ukraine, Sudan. No? That's the anti semitism.
83. Thanks Bob. Let me know how to subscribe to your newsletter you clown.
84. >This is going to shock you, but conveying the entirety of an entire platform of policies is literally impossible This is going to shock you, but it's not necessary to convey the entirety of an entire (sic) platform, a broad understanding would suffice. This is a failure of the party not the voters. >But please answer my question, what was the LNP's messaging and why do you think it was so succesful? You keep trying to change the subject, I can only assume you're trying to paint me as an LNP voter who only did so out blindly out of loyalty or "time for a change" mentality. Who I voted for is irrelevant, both to your argument and to our system of voter anonymity. Suffice it to say I have no party allegiance, and the only options in my electorate were ALP, LNP, One Nation, Greens and Family First. None of whom I would urinate on if they were burning.
85. Hippy 😂😂😂 you don’t even know who I voted for. Ok. I think all this is done has highlighted your anger issues, and what you think of…I assume green voters?
86. Oh no, we downgrade from a AA+ credit rating to an AA rating. The horror.
87. Unfortunately this is exactly how that argument is going. It’s wild. Imagine being called anti-Slavic for criticising Putin.
88. Since you asked, yes they have. Are they doing it right now, no because the most pressing issue is the nation that Israel is erasing. You know this to be true and that’s why you’re arguing in bad faith. If you actually supported the government’s actions you wouldn’t need to paint it as antisemitism.
89. It’s actually wild that you claim to be a green supporter but until recently and somehow think this party is racist. I bet you’ve never voted green in your life.
90. > This is going to shock you, but it's not necessary to convey the entirety of an entire (sic) platform, a broad understanding would suffice. This is a failure of the party not the voters. Which they absolutely did, I'm not sure what you think they didn't convey. > You keep trying to change the subject, I can only assume you're trying to paint me as an LNP voter who only did so out blindly out of loyalty or "time for a change" mentality. Who I voted for is irrelevant, both to your argument and to our system of voter anonymity. Suffice it to say I have no party allegiance, and the only options in my electorate were ALP, LNP, One Nation, Greens and Family First. None of whom I would urinate on if they were burning. It's entirely on subject, you claimed the Greens failed because of poor messaging, the easy inference is that the LNP succeeded because of good messaging, I never made any claims who you voted for, that's your persecution complex coming through.
