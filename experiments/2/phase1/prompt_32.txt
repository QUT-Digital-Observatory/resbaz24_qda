Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. I voted LNP I‚Äôve voted for labour previously. At this point I take the policy out of it as stuff all changes these days. We need to hold both sides accountable for stuff ups that cost us be it LNP or ALP. That‚Äôs how we should all vote‚Ä¶. Too many fk ups and your out. Maybe they‚Äôll learn that way.
2. Nuclear power. That's the only reason I voted for them
3. I have family in Townsville/NQ. They voted liberal primarily because of the youth crime slogan, which tbh I kind of understand. (Even if I don‚Äôt agree with the policies LNP have proposed to achieve this). Youth crime may be dropping state wide but up there it‚Äôs increasing. I have family members with PTSD due to being victims of it. It‚Äôs an issue for many people up there with strong emotions attached to it. Emotions can cloud judgement on the ‚Äúhow‚Äù - they‚Äôre just happy someone has taken a strong stance on something that has terrorised them. But still fuck the LNP.
4. A lot of people I know really didn't like miles idea for QE2 stadium, crime stats and the state budget issues.
5. My local LNP member has actually been fairly proactive in the area over the last 4 years, and managed to retain his seat for the next 4. Does also help that he's the rare breed of politician who *genuinely wants to help his community* and isn't just in the role to benefit his bank account....
6. Easy, because they are both equally incompetant in different ways and the best thing to do is swap them over as often as possible to get the most balanced outcome.
7. I‚Äôm the first to stand up and say I know bugger all about politics and strongly agree with a comment on here about better education on the subject. I voted alp because I have personally felt the hand from labour. Contracts get cancelled, withdrawn when labour is in. And yes it happens midway in government contracts. About thirty of us were laid off because labour got voted in last time and that was just our area it happened to the vast majority of people in the industry. (It‚Äôs a federal contract.). Literally almost overnight we went from having work to no work. I‚Äôm not sure why but when liberal are in people seem to spend money. When labour get in, they stop spending.
8. Most people don't know who the National party is. Never taught in schools. Without the two parties combined both State and Federal would never get a majority on their own right.
9. LoL üòÖ and here I was thinking this wasn't disingenuous... My bad.
10. LNP is more supportive of mining and, like it or not, that‚Äôs where the money comes from to sustain a first world society given the lack of manufacturing as compared to pre-Lima Agreement times.
11. Democracy is not a winner take all event Needs to be deep seated social contract
12. People vote for the LNP for 4 reasons. 1. They hate a group/type of people. 2. They have short term memory issues and no desire to learn anything about politics, Australia and the economy besides what their lord and saviour Rupert Murdoch tells them. 3. They are wealthy and have vested interests in the LNP and can profit from them being in office. 4. That's who their family votes for and politics are boring and it doesn't matter. That's it. No exceptions.
13. Many people I know who vote LNP have always done so because their wealthy parents have done so. So not really a positive reason, but a reason‚Ä¶
14. As someone who keeps out of politics because of toxic personalities dominating social media, and don't watch tv or listen to the radio. I found there was practically zero reliable information to help me decide. I tried to google LNP policies, ALP policies and just get returned with the same junk, mostly news outlets sprooking their agenda and reddit pages consisting of insufferable people calling anyone who doesn't vote the same way "Idiots". Had there been itemised breakdowns of what is what that showed up after 5 mins of googling, I probably would have voted differently.
15. When will you all wake up and realise you are libertarians?
16. Because Crisafulli looks like he will actually get shit done, unlike Miles who comes across as a spoilt private school prima donna and typical 'public servant' who will talk alot but get nothing done... Also the ALP abortion scare campaign was ridiculous.
17. What the actual misinformation campaign was run in QLD? The answers on this are blowing my mind. It should be a jail-able offence to spread this type of misinformation.
18. Because I chose to vote mainly based on candidates rather than political affiliation, and the LNP candidate for my electorate is a decent person who does lots for the community.
19. To keep crims in prison and reform them , ALP have also over spent, which fuels inflation. There is no such thing as "free"
20. A friend was voting LNP because Labor kept interfering with small-scale(usually recreational, not making enough money to sustain yourself, if any) sapphire mining claims in the gemfields. So they're hoping voting for the LNP will help keep towns running in the gemfields with tourism rather than have to close up shop. Reading the comments, It seems to be a pretty consistant issue for Labor and the greens tbh.. not listening to queenslanders outside the city.. Something for next time.
21. Being concerned about your future because one shit gov replaced a previous shit gov speaks volumes about the lack of self accountability we've developed as Australians. The percentage of your potential linked to a state government is way smaller than the mental energy you all spend worrying about it. Go outside
22. My parents voted LNP because of Labor had been in too long, hated the idea of school kids getting free school lunches (my Mum was a former Teacher and really pissed her off about the school lunch idea), my Dad is a bit conservative and has always hated Palaszczuk and was happy when she quit but also thinks there are too many public servants. Plus they're really concerned about the state economy and massive debt. Plus the Olympics fiasco and how we are going to afford it.
23. Because labour has been in power for 30 of the last 35 years and have been shit.
24. Every time I sit in a traffic jam in or out of Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast (on the Bruce Highway), I know whose eyes I‚Äôm cursing.
25. I didn't vote for the LNP. I voted against the ALP. The unconstitutional attacks on the building unions, the ones that initially founded the Labor party, deserve a total reset of the ALP. The federal branch is next...
26. My local Labor candidate has no political experience and was running on a try something new campaign essentially.
27. The construction unions are out of control. Labor has no solution to address housing shortages. We need the change
28. I have shares in mining companies. Future outlook is positive. /s
29. Because their opinion was the LNP was the best for the state for the next 4 years. In their opinion it was the best option. It‚Äôs the reason 99% of people vote for any one. Either that, it‚Äôs because they just randomly did because they liked the colour blue more etc. This is something more prevalent with enforced voting. The old adage, I‚Äôm in the booth, may as well pick someone.
30. All the tolerant left trying their best to insult their own because theyre but hurt their party lost‚Ä¶ badly
31. Of the 5 friends I‚Äôve spoken to, only 1 voted. They‚Äôre all under 30 except for one (and he‚Äôs a die-hard Trump fan who would only care about AusPol if Trump was running). Pretty much sums up why LNP won imo. Not positive per se, just pointing out that Crisafulli likely benefitted from the staggering sense of ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äô coming from people under 30. I think if either party had committed to stable housing or affordable rentals, the impact could have been huge.
32. How I voted my ballot in the Clayfield electorate: 1. LNP 2. ALP 3. One Nation 4. Libertarian 5. Greens A few reasons that influenced my vote: - As a single 29yo I don‚Äôt see too much value in cheap public transport or school lunches I would rather see the government use funds to lower my taxes or improve the services I use. - I did not appreciate the fear campaign by ALP and moreso ABC news ran around abortion policies despite both major parties committing to not making any policy changes in that space early on. - Over the years I have considered many of the ALP policies and decisions irrational . - My landlord is a good man I hold in high regard who promoted LNP for the area he has lived in his entire life. - I saw multiple federal greens member in protest photos where people held signs promoting harm to Jewish people as well as terrorist symbols. I cannot consciously vote for a party or any member in it that share these values or don‚Äôt hold their people accountable for this. What I‚Äôve learned from the election results: - Here in the big country city we are making decisions that negatively influencing rural Queenslanders and we need to be more considerate to their needs. - Reddit seems to blame legacy/murdoch media for the way QLD voted while being blind to their own media bias. As a result they dismiss the QLD voters as uninformed or mislead without putting much more effort in understanding their concerns. Thankyou.
33. In my house it‚Äôs greens last, Labour second last, some other guys next and LNP or Pauline‚Äôs team top 2 in any order.
34. Because people want a change from our government following the lead of Biden et al. Americans will probably get the change they need shortly.
35. This is democracy? Tough luck deal with it or go live in Russia.
36. Rusted on Labor supporters are always a good laugh. Keep it up sooks.
37. I voted Labour. I‚Äôm not upset that LNP got in. Changing of the guard every few years encourages fresh ideas and fresh approaches - not only for the new incumbents but for Labour too.
38. Ultimately, I vote for the canidate in my electorate that best represents me. They are LNP. In the past I've voted red. In addition: 1. Labor havn't been great with the economy. 2. Labor have treated the business community with disdain. Consultation doesn't happen, silly decisions. 3. I don't think they've taken crime seriously
39. You're only concerned because you want to see the country go down the toilet. Wake up to yourself!!
40. If you find any actual positive reasons, I'd like to know. LNP are great at shit taking labour, not very good at getting anything useful done for the average Joe. If you're a big corporation though, I'm sure you'll be getting some tax breaks soon.
41. I don't know any fuckwits that vote LNP or NO on the Voice referendum or read or listen to Murdoch news or Facebook or Twitter because I and my friends aren't gullible mouth breathing fuckwits!
42. A consistent concerted attack for 4 years proving that DC is able to take the helm and with a strong message on items Labor didn't really want to touch, ultimately turned into a smeer campaign from Labor, we are all over Youth Crime/Crime, we are over the corruption that Labor did consistently and without being held really accountable and the handling of COVID definately affected way too many people for many reasons - the Olympics handling is a shitshow - plus I voted for LNP to do a reset as no one in the Labor party front bench has Oppostion experience so will allow the LNP to go free for all and get things into line again for Labor to eventually take over again.... LNP winning is a good thing to all those Labor voters, but we all need to hold LNP accountable for the promises , i.e reduce Ramping Times was one that stands out as a hard metric and clearly the prmises coming out today, being help accountable is what makes things work. My 2 cents FWIW. Oh and on the topic of "mum and dad" and "boomer" being the ones only voting LNP it appears there was a strong \~20 year old voting section sick of Labor and Green unrealistic bullshit..... go QLD.
43. Voted liberal because I'm still bitter about the COVID over reaction and border closures. I couldn't see my family for two years and missed my father's funeral because at the time NSW had one COVID case Stuff Labor Plus Miles tried to buy an election by adding more and more to debt that our children will pay for
44. I didn't. I think Steven Mike's was doing a good job.
45. We don‚Äôt have to see Crisafoolya on the tv., Twitter tone Facebook every. 2 minutes telling porky pies
46. Because they won't continue with some of the hydro electricity projects
47. I was so genuinely shocked. How tf did they win?!
48. I have many good reasons for voting LNP. I want much tougher on youth crime. Enough is enough. The "softly softly...oh poor little kids" approach. Is utter nonsense. I care about the victims of crime. Not the little mongrels committing the crimes. They need to be off the streets and locked away if they won't stop AND I am totally against them ruining a beautiful natural valley at Eungalla for a freakin Hydro plant üò° The most utterly disgraceful brain fart ever. Would be an utter tragedy. And I'm very sure that's why ALP lost Mackay. And our LNP member got back in because hes a great MP for us
49. My boomer Dad didn't vote LNP, he did an informal vote so it doesn't get counted, because "he'll never forgive Labor for what they did to the furniture industry." Way back in the 80s he was a qualified french polisher working in factories around Brisbane that specialised in hand crafting furniture. Apparently Labor at the time was the reason that all this "cheap and nasty flat pack stuff" started coming into the country and all the furniture making businesses went bust because of it, which meant he was out of a job and his trade pretty much went out of existence. I tried to explain to him that the Labor party of today is nowhere near the same as it was in the 80s, but nope, wouldn't listen. So there you have it, my Dad throws his votes away now because he's holding onto a decades old grudge against the Labor party. üôÑ
50. I didn‚Äôt vote/ and this year I convinced like 10 family members and about 20 friends not to vote. All in all it was a good year
51. What's the big secret? Labor can't govern, all they know how to do is bloat government and spend money on garbage. It was well overdue. Labor are finished in this country and you won't see another majority labor government in 20 years if ever.
52. Well I decided that the economy of Queensland suffered enough under the ALP. The ALP did no real good over their tenure excluding getting the Olympics here and keeping Qld safe in the face of covid. But one of the important things the LNP bring is a stop to the escalating issue of youth crime. Some areas have youth doing horrific things just because they can get away with it. No more. Furthermore let‚Äôs hope the LNP fixes the economy of the state, and doesn‚Äôt continue its downward spiral. Another great thing is the LNP will listen to the citizens more, particularly with the Olympics and will make sure we done go down as a disgrace or disappointment to the world during it. Also let‚Äôs be honest, the last ALP leader for QLD was a dick and needed to not be allowed back in power.
53. I always look at female candidates first - I think they're overlooked and underrepresented. The only woman in my electorate (out of 6 candidates) was LNP (I didn't vote LNP, but considered it)
54. The first thing to do is not panic. There is an old adage in Australia. We dont vote parties in, we vote parties out. Giggles and his ex boss were at the helm when property prices rocketed, cost of living rocketed and youth crime rocketed, amongst many other things. People voted out giggles snd Anastacia, rather than voting in the libs. I voted LNP btw.
55. Any organisation stagnates if leadership doesn't evolve. Hold all things equal, having a change at the top (and the respective mates and status quo being challenged at the next few levels down) is only a good thing for qld. Public data on the real cost of infrastructure and hospital performance so we can actually hold people accountable and get things fixed will be a win for taxpayers too. It's your money after all. I guess the big one for most people is that it's clear the youth crime policy wasn't working. Time will tell, but anything different to the current policy is worth trying if it can stop kids thinking crippling a families finances by crashing their car (and possibly killing someone in the process) is a net win. Obviously not just "my friend" ;)
56. Firstly Steven Miles has got a jacked set of teeth and he was never voted in by the public for the top job, did I mention that set of chompers he‚Äôs got going on, yeah that‚Äôs why I voted Lib, couldn‚Äôt really look at his head any longer
57. One of the massive things I want to see a change in with the government is over spending. I think the initiative that Trump and Musk suggested with government efficiency is a really good idea. While the LNP haven't explicitly said they will do this, I think that they (in a quest to privatise things more) will waste money on meaningless jobs less than ALP. TLDR: ALP spends more money than LNP and I think do it in a wasteful manner
58. what a silly question. You should refer this question to Albo and his policies mate!
59. If it's a really safe seat for the other party, they will run inexperienced candidates to develop and test them for future runs in more viable seats (all the parties do this). They aren't really trying to win they're trying to outperform expectations and make the incumbent work for it as much as possible. Campaigning is a gruelling job, and competent operators don't really want to run for seats if there's no realistic chance of winning.
60. Some of the candidates were insane looking. The guy running for Labor against JPL in Surfer‚Äôs Paradise was literally a teenager straight out of high school who had just started a bachelors degree. I mean I know that the ALP were never going to win that seat, but *what*?
61. I note that there is no mention of policies or what the candidate stands for, just, we recognised their face...
62. That person didn't almost win on their "progressive" proposition. That person benefited from the minor parties putting the majors last and she swooped up ON/UAP preferences.
63. Yeh it was same in my area. Our MP is LNP and well known, has actually gotten a few things accomplished for the region, so of course everyone voted for them. Meanwhile the Labour candidate was some unknown.
64. I think the same of my local. He's a great bloke, does loads and loads and makes sure we know through different comms methods. He was revoted in and with more margin by lots. In all honesty if he left LNP and went to another party or by himself, I'd still vote for him, cause I like him and I'm not using him to pick a party in this instance.
65. Some of the candidates were insane looking. The guy running for Labor against JPL in Surfer‚Äôs Paradise was literally a teenager straight out of high school who had just started a bachelors degree. I mean I know that the ALP were never going to win that seat, but *what*?
66. The amount of people I have known over the years that still think LNP are progressive because they have ‚Äúliberal‚Äù in their name is so concerning to me. Most recently, a lawyer at senior associate level.
67. LNP famously taxes the hell out of mining companies, not like Steven Miles who had all that supportive advertising from the resources council because he was trying to reduces their taxes. Oh wait, it is all the opposite of that.
68. Really gonna get back at them by not charging them any royalties. That'll show the bastards
69. When the working out is correct but the answer is wrong‚Ä¶
70. I knew there was some braindead supporters in the party but never thought they'd stoop to such a statement Yikes
71. The amount of people who were so grossly misinformed and still voted is absolutely frightening to me.
72. He doesn't know who Crusafali is friends with? And where a huge amount of LNP campaign funding came from?
73. Yep, I stopped asking family cause it was a rotation of this and I just don't have time to care about that anymore. Q
74. Re: Point 3. Miles can bench 100kg. Surely that's a win. He also has a pretty good social media campaign. Number 4 is a little disappointing - so many Gen Z targeted information packages out there.
75. I used to be a number 2 until this exact election. (To be fair, I started questioning things earlier than this but it was this election that was the first to get a new vote from me).
76. Steven miles is easily the coolest. The guy is jacked
77. Sadly #2 is more common than most of us realise. Wealth and ignorance breed same...
78. Make no mistake, this is by design. LNP and the Media have always been best buds. Together they've eroded everything from education to well.... media...
79. 2 - pretty silly imagine voting for the enemy who makes things worse for you.
80. This is where the argument against compulsory voting could be made -_- How many of these people went to the booths with absolutely no clue and just numbered randomly
81. Most of the people I know who voted lnp did so because of #1‚Ä¶ but when I asked if they support throwing 15yo kids in adult jails the response was tumbleweeds‚Ä¶ People have forgotten and also people under 25 don‚Äôt understand how shit the 31 months of Newman was.
82. the thing that gets me is that... youth crime has always been common. but with social media... its made out to seem like its happening in every suburb, on every street.
83. Youth crime isn‚Äôt an issue, it‚Äôs the goddamn Magistrates who are the issue. For example, the imprisonment liability for stealing a car is 10-14 years depending on circumstances of aggravation. The legislation is already there to deal with the crime, magistrates just don‚Äôt use it. Instead of voting for Mr Crucifix‚Äôs stupid slogan (if youth crime is your vice), people should be voting for the party who has publicly campaigned to hold magistrates accountable for their decisions ‚Ä¶ oh wait, there‚Äôs no such party.
84. The people who only decide when they are standing in their cardboard booth kill me. How can you function on planet earth without some kind of decision making expertise. They are so incredibly vulnerable to lies and deceptive tactics, which gets the conservative vote in the bag
85. 4 makes me so mad because they do teach that shit in school at least they did when I was there. Are the students not listening or does no one think it's worth educating them about anymore? I have heard multiple cases of young adults not even understanding that we have preferential voting even though it was hammered into our heads at the same age.
86. They need to clear out all the homeless in Brisbane
87. Again a good argument for why voting shouldn't be compulsory
88. I call bullshit on #3, Miles > Crisafulli by any metric.
89. This is absolutely fucked. All four of those make me want to throw up, and knowing that people like that exist makes me incredibly sad.
90. You missed No 5. Labour Couldn‚Äôt organise a shit in a toilet because union oh&s wanna watch for safety violations.
91. Option 3 never happened. Option 1 is why I would have if I still lived up there. Those rampant little shits need hard time with no parole.
92. Yep someone I know voted LNP cause ‚ÄúAnastasia got fat which means she got too smug‚Äù
93. As a nurse during COVID, I hated him as health minister. Still put him above LNP though
94. I definitely thought the same during COVID (he *was* both smug, and an asshole during his COVID press conferences), but I came around to him as premier, and put Labor above LNP because I'm not mental.
95. Lots of friends ( even those who no longer live in Qld) give this as their reason
