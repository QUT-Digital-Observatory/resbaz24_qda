Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Just like any other politician in history I guess. Difference here being we don’t all go and preemptively protest something about that isn’t happening. Like do we preemptively protest the fact that we may not end up becoming a “renewable energy superpower” as promised by Albo?
2. So you preemptively protest all the other shit the other teams say too then? They are all politicians. They are all as bad as each other obviously.
3. 1. So we don’t trust anything the other guys says too. Perhaps he was also going to ban them. 2. Oh I’m well aware. They also are incredibly weak and pointless at times too. We’ve stopped that war in Gaza pretty quickly. Protests though are actually excellent at dividing a nation too. Going further back on history, the number that have ended in bloody wars is high. (Obviously won’t be the case here but you talked about history of protests, so it’s relevant).
4. Nothing is changing. Youve been brainwashed by labors propaganda machine.
5. You would have a rough time in Europe if you think Australians are overly political hahaha
6. We all learn things at a different pace, it's okay. If you were here during Campbell Newman's term you'd have realised we do in fact care about how our state is run. Or mid pandemic. Things have just been kind of boring as of late.
7. Sarcasm, or pride in ignorance and lack of knowledge? I'd bet pride, given how much this country props up and idealises mediocrity.
8. Look into it, what was done since the 70’s until 2018 in rape cases. Id be interested. As I stated money, timing and wrong partner account for the most abortions, medical is a very small amount as well. They are red herrings in pro-life debates, because those have always been legal anyway and I believe women have a choice in those cases. I could never tell a sick woman or rape victim what to do. All women need love and support in all cases.
9. You are a clown get the vax or lose your job is not choice without consequences.
10. >Do you really want me to quote all the times in history a politician said they won't do something, then proceed to do it? Sorry, at what point does it becomes misinformation to whip bases into a frenzy based on... Nothing? Politicians can break their word but you are aware that changing abortion access was not a policy of the LNP for this election? What are we even doing here? Note I generally support the current level of access to abortions.
11. Yup its insane that this mob swallowed the labor propaganda hook line and sinker. Abortion was never unattainable and the law was never pursued. How long has the clinic in bowen hills been openly operating for? As long as I remember. Labor has some serious shit to answer for. They are a party of fear and they are clearly whipping up the crazies.
12. People are trying to get home after work.Why not a saturday or sunday when more people are likely to show up.
13. That makes no sense in relation to what I said.
14. I get that. Apologies for the long response. I think in general Australians aren’t really educated on protests (which makes sense because protests are against governments in most cases). The unions used to lead a lot of protest movements but over the years this is much less so. Now media paints them as more ‘radical’, ‘ideological’ and ‘idealistic’. The mainstream rhetoric around protests needs to be called out because they are immensely more powerful than government wants you to think. It doesn’t matter if you agree with the cause of not, a politician is forced to pay attention to a protest. It costs money for policing, road closures, and indirect economic effects (e.g. buses running late so workers less productive that day). It causes nuisance (noise, hard to get around, makes people upset and annoyed like “it’s incredibly frustrating that there’s another annoying protest AGAIN, can they just fix this shit already”). And, *possibly most importantly* it gets people talking. Media might report on it (unless it directly threatens the media moguls), but without a doubt locals will be talking about it. Whether it’s to mention to your boss why you’re late, explain to your kid why people are yelling in the streets or whatever else. These conversations are opportunities to share experiences and educate one another. They also lead to politicians being questioned more intensely on the topic and occasionally force them to review their stance. We’re incredibly lucky to live in a country where protest is legal. However the rhetoric around peaceful protests that go against the state (e.g. anti-apartheid protests now and for South Africa) is becoming increasingly hostile. We now even see a ‘social democratic’ party like Labor with politicians calling for protests to be cancelled or heavily policed. Whether you agree with a cause or not, we must educate our kids on the power of protests and civil disobedience; so they too can use it when lives (and women’s healthcare) are at risk. [I recommend watching this 4 minute video on protest](https://youtu.be/c_g1BMVFcuw?si=R5Anu0r7essFeIxr) **Tldr** : protest invokes change through many direct and indirect means. Even the most hard-right government would have to pay attention. After all, protest is one of the first things to be criminalised by a dictator.
15. Comment respectfully. Continued harassment may result in you being banned.
16. Because 99.9% of women abort due to not wanting it. That’s why.
17. Being against child murder isn’t caring too much it’s basically the minimum
18. So they shouldn’t abstain? Didn’t have pro-r*pe on my baby killer bingo card
19. It opens up medical professionals to be sued for all sorts of things, if a baby is not compatible with life, anti abortion groups will still sue and it will still be a burden on the people involved and the medical system. By throwing enough money at the situation litigators can effectively ban abortions.
20. We aren't the legislators. They are meant to legislate on our behalf, but they are trying to appease their imaginary sky daddy.
21. [Terminations for medical reasons](https://www.pinkelephants.org.au/page/71/what-is-tfmr) can occur relatively late in the pregnancy - some defects aren't detected until 19/20 weeks in. A termination after this point is often just the woman being induced to give birth. In very rare cases a 20-week fetus may survive delivery live briefly after being delivered, but won't survive long after, and the underlying medical causes that necessitated the TFMR remain. This legislation would force doctors to provide CPR to resuscitate - for example - a baby which has developed with no kidneys, or which is missing the part of its brain which tells the organs how to function, and is incapable of sustaining its own life. Effectively, this law prolongs the pain of the child and traumatises the parents. It's a concept which is copied from the US, where the Republicans introduced similar ["born alive"](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/03/the-facts-on-the-born-alive-debate/) laws to try to intimidate doctors away from providing necessary medical terminations. The law relies on people having a reaction like you're having in order to further restrict necessary medical care. The writers of this legislation are literally imposing further suffering on an already horrific situation just to win votes.
22. you don’t understand how “born alive” abortions work the fetus isn’t viable and will not survive outside the womb, the baby (usually desperately wanted and loved) will die, sometimes in its grieving mothers arms, it will not survive, it is inhumane and incredibly cruel to try to resuscitate a non-viable fetus, this bill will do NOTHING but force clinics to stop offering second trimester abortions from fear of persecution, it will do nothing but force women to carry babies that won’t survive, and puts the mothers at a much, much,much higher chance of severe complications or dying. these abortions aren’t change of mind abortions, these are the abortions that have to happen to save mothers, and creating legislation that puts mothers and providers at risk of persecution will only make them harder to access.
23. I quoted The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG), because they are qualified medical specialists in this field. The architect of the *Termination of Pregnancy (Live Birth) Bill* were Christian Hard Right Anti-Abortion activists such as Joanna Howe and 'Cherish Life.' Hence, the description in the Bill is inaccurate (and I'm being incredibly generous).
24. Don’t bother. I had an argument with someone last night about this on here and they wouldn’t even be open to adding into law providing palliative care to a baby born alive after a failed termination. It sounds like basic human decency to do so, but people link it to taking away abortion rights (which from my understanding is not what this is about at all in terms of the legislation). It is essentially a legal guardrail anyway for the people who believe it isn’t happening. Why not just legislate to prevent any suffering that could even be remotely occurring? When I mentioned that it was already a thing in NSW and SA, I just got heavily disliked and they moved on.
25. Ol mate up there already told me all I needed to know. Can you disprove it??
26. You make a good point there. It just shows how nuanced the issue is. I do know of someone who aborted late stage (Down Syndrome) and ended up with this situation. Again, I don't know all the details, but it didn't sound like something I'd choose.
27. 'Their Plan' is to wait for KAP to retable their bill, then 'allow' a conscience vote on it, which will get it to pass. it's extremely dishonest.
28. A couple literally went to court in 2010 charged with procuring an illegal abortion. It’s great that you were able to access the care you needed but no need to downplay serious concerns. Criminalisation of abortion makes it more difficult for doctors to know where they stand which inhibits access - more doctors simply don’t want to offer the procedure if the legality relies on a grey area. We do not want to go down that path.
29. Your experience is not at all representative of a lot of other people's experience. Decriminalisation also means ease of access, reduced cost, less stigma etc. The way you've presented this is really disingenuous. There is a shit load of research out there you can access on all the reasons why the original reform was needed, and why going back would be a catastrophe
30. Fuck off. It’s beyond frustrating that we have to argue about abortion in 2024. Your story is one of success, but the rest of the state exists. When abortion is illegal, it’s not so easy for the hundreds of thousands of other people to just pop down to the SE and get an abortion from a sympathetic doctor. Think outside your box.
31. It's probably the mods using alt accounts... What's hilarious is the left have been banging on about 'misinformation' since their disastrous referendum failed, but they themselves engage in it incessantly.
32. OR GREENS you absolute fucking moron. Jesus Christ were you born this stupid or did you hit your head at some point?
33. Hence my question to them, dude. "What the fuck is wrong with you?" I know they'll never actually respond to reason but I can't help but check now and then. Sucker for punishment.
34. My exact point. Condoms exist so does birth controll for women. You dont want a baby maybe use those instead of doing the thing that creates babies and hoping for no baby.
35. Sure, incredibly stupid, but still very possible. I am an American/Australian and vote in both places, so I will say my perspective is skewed. I fully accept that. But the American experience is important here, because American style politics is absolutely infecting the LNP right now. The U.S. Republicans fought for a generation to roll back abortion rights and they won that. It also caused them electoral problems, probably helping to blunt their wins in 2022. They are also still having to deal with the fallout right now in the current election. They did that even though it would be unpopular for most Americans because they believed that abortion is murder. And when you truly believe that abortion is the literal slaughter of defenceless children, your logical decision making becomes short circuited. The QLD LNP might be smarter and better politicians than the American Republicans, but I really doubt it. I mean look at what they did the last time they were in power......went through QLD society like a wrecking ball. We can hope they learned from that but I bet what they really learned is to get as much done in a term as possible before they are turfed out again. All that said, I hope you are right, but I am not being complacent and comforted. The only way to ensure they don't is getting out and protesting, making lots of noise, and making it incredibly clear that they will be punished deeply if they make the change. Even then I am not sure it will be enough. As you said, we need to keep that opposition forefront in their minds. >They are aware that this isn't the 1950s Yes, but they WANT 1950's morality, and have watched bans succeed in the U.S. They want what Florida and places like that have right now, not just in the 1950's.
36. "*Like do we preemptively protest the fact that we may not end up becoming a “renewable energy superpower” as promised by Albo?*" Yet thats becoming true especially if we don't have idiots like Crusifulli removing Major pumped hydro projects for no apparent reason. if we stick to the plan that is laid out by the AEMO, it will be achieved all without requiring Nuclear or any other fantasy technology.
37. how are your mental backflips this strong? how can you see someone refuse to answer a simple question on a conscious vote so many times and simply think "yep nothing wrong with this seems legit"
38. Can you point out where he says something to the effect of "If KAP put a vote to the Parliament, I will instruct the party room to vote No"?
39. Why would they change something they've supported for years and never questioned it? On the other hand the other party didn't answer the question until asked over 100 times. Yeh you can keep reaching in regard to the protests and choosing what points suit your narrative.
40. How much are they paying you to lick their assholes? I believe I could do a better job than you. At least I could make logical arguments, not weird twisted ramblings disguised as "intelligent" debate. What's the rate?
41. I was extremely sick in my first pregnancy. Bed bound. I had horrible hyperemesis gravidrum which is extreme morning sickness. I was already 47kg and was down to below 40kg. I was offered a termination so many times but I so wanted my baby. I was lucky my partner could pay the bills and my work was supportive. However if my second pregnancy was like that I’d have no choice other to terminate as I’d have nobody to watch my child whilst I was in hospital. My partner needs to work to pay for food and mortgage. Thankfully I had normal sickness and not bad hg. I’m on a hg fb group and most of the women have to get abortions because of lack of support. Work doesn’t support them, can’t be in hospital because they have other kids. It’s heartbreaking. I don’t believe most are due to these reasons. Pregnancy especially in first trimester is so difficult. Second pregnancy I had gallstones which is common but wow was painful and can’t get surgery - as pregnant . The amount of illnesses due to pregnancy would be the reasons of termination in my opinion. There’s no support for women when unwell and pregnant. You get told oh that’s common. Normal. Being sick off your work. Having other children to look after. Men won’t ever experience it so shouldn’t tell women what to do. And from what I’ve heard from friends who have had medical abortions, it’s extremely painful, horrific cramps and bleeding. So I’m sure women don’t make these choices lightly so men should keep their opinions to themselves.
42. She didn’t lose her job. I guess hers is just more important than yours since you lost your job? Must be easily replaced huh? The uneducated are usually easily replaceable
43. Maybe if you try really really hard you can get some education in medicine and figure it out! Don’t hurt yourself trying to figure it out though.
44. Because the people that will show up are perpetually online crazies that don't work
45. I'm just going to leave this here... hypocrite. 😂 https://preview.redd.it/k51y7ms70exd1.png?width=659&format=png&auto=webp&s=44878d9d192c53d46928decbb3b5da69efac4190
46. A woman should be able to abort a fetus. Maybe if your mind had been given time to develope, you would have realised that too but aye, you're a child. Go back to posting on the wings of fire subreddit.
47. Loving your statistics and lack of actually reading anything I write regarding women’s medical health. Grow up.
48. I feel so sorry for you that you think people are actually murdering children 💀did Jesus rot your brain
49. Which is more horrific: keeping doomed babies alive, or aborting perfectly healthy babies?
50. You're saying you have data to back up those claims, "these abortions aren’t change of mind abortions" I mean some are, like chromosomal disorders etc, As for "these have to happen to save mothers" Then they will happen... You cannot just claim "Oh the doctor will have to care for the baby if it survives so the doctor will now fear to do an abortion", They only get prosecuted if they have a living baby in front of them and don't care for it but instead just refuse to provide it healthcare, This is no different that any other expectation within the medical field, you know first do no harm.... You're literally fear mongering based off nothing more than journalists hyperbolic propaganda engineered to incite emotion so that you continue to share that link and visit the page as that is their business model. lmao can you provide any literature for you wild claims?
51. This is the first time I've read anyone going through the real issues in an Australian forum. Refreshing. I mostly see people chanting meaningless slogans. I hope any future projects and engagements are filled with real issues and honest discussions of ethics and the impact on the women, doctors, foetus,and potential fathers. Particularly, I'm not excited by assertions from uninvolved people. Whenever you hear something really dumb and strongly worded, it's from a spectator. I'm a bit of a spectator myself, so I want to hear from involved and affected people. Thanks for some data. It's along the lines of what I heard from American sources. I'd love to hear from Canada and the UK.
52. Yes. Because a) abortions are carried out before the age of viability, so no birth before 22 weeks will survive b) if there is an abortion after this stage it would be an induction of a baby that has a condition that is not compatible with life anyway. These babies often are born breathing, legislating a doctor to provide ‘lifesaving care’ is removing time parents might have had with their dying child to implement care that is traumatic and unnecessary. C) do people really think viable babies are being born and a doctor just watches them gasp for air when they could help, and just choose not to? And D) ‘failed abortion’ Is a thing that happens so rarely it’s not even worth discussing. It’s a fantasy. Nobody in favour of this bill has offered any statistics or data to support their position.
53. Basically. It’s not “our” plan to put it to the vote, but if it does go anyway, plausible deniability.
54. I believe that’s because they didn’t access care through a doctor but rather ordered a medical abortion drug online. If I recall correctly the charge didn’t stick. Even when they tried to charge surgeons in the 70’s for doing abortions it didn’t stick. That moral legislation wasn’t really a barrier to care. I agree completely that the legislation shouldn’t change but all this fear mongering about Katter wanting to repeal the legislation isn’t warranted.
55. I wasn’t being disingenuous. I also worked in histopath in 2010’s in QLD and we got heaps ie maybe 30 D&C specimens each day. It definitely didn’t seem like some extremely old and rarely enforced legislation was preventing women’s access to care. I don’t want legislation to change but I do think QLD’s previous approach to abortion is being intentionally misrepresented by some.
56. Abortions were being performed for decades prior to 2018 with no criminal penalties. The decriminalisation was a hangover from an extremely old law that effectively wasn’t being enforced.
57. Green, just doubled yourself down on your stupidity. Go buy some more multi coloured hair dye and continue to only get political advice from your friend group.
58. Condoms, used correctly are 98% effective. Taking into consideration human error, they're 87% effective. The pill is 99% effective, but drops to 93% when adjusted for errors. This can be as simple as forgetting a pill, or vomiting, or diarrhoea. So, now you have those stats, what do you say about those who is use birth control, but still end up with a pregnancy? Unwanted children are unwanted children. Forcing birth creates all sorts of social and economic issues, not to mention mental health issues. Increases in PPD etc. I'll take having the freedom to choose over being forced to birth. If you don't agree, then you can keep YOUR baby, but you can't force me to keep mine.
59. I understand you have the benefit of knowledge of both systems. I'm not sure how much American style politics is seeping into Australia, but hopefully it can stay at a minimum. But imo, and I could be wrong, this is just anecdotal: religion is not as big a factor in Australian politics as the States. You're right, I didn't think about them trying to get everything done in one term. It would be politically stupid, but possible. Just on the balance of probabilities, the recriminalisation of abortion is a long shot. You can message "I told you so" if it happens. But I predict (and hope) it stays hypothetical.
60. I mean blame who you want. But as you know well, it’s ultimately on the person who said it.
61. And how can you be sucked in so badly with the scare tactics we have seen on this issue. It’s an opinion. Would you put your life savings and everything you own on the fact that he’s going to renege and ban abortion in legislation?
62. Has that question been asked? I mean he can’t answer questions he hasn’t been asked hahahahhahaha.
63. So all those promises you voted on yesterday, you actually completely distrust as well?
64. I’m sorry you went through that, we should fight for women to have more support in cases like yours and even supporting women more during pregnancy to minimise abortions. More resources and guidance. That is healthcare. It doesn’t matter that you believe most abortions are for medical conditions, it’s just plain facts unfortunately what I said. I love you for pushing though in your first pregnancy, your child should know, they will look at you as a hero!
65. And like I said, you would have been covered even without the 2018 “any reason” termination bill.
66. Covid would have been a boom time for her I heard Only fans went crazy
67. No, I want you to tell me. Why is abortion not murder? Why is it healthcare?
68. My drugs are Dutton as PM and Trump as President
69. I was quoting that mentally unstable person and I stand by exactly my response, she is a horrible person and is mentally unstable. If you or anyone agrees with them, you belong in that group as well.
70. Why do you need statistics to prove the obvious? It’s like telling me you need statistics to prove majority of people are overweight
71. Yes, and FYI that is already the offical guidance, so in that case the bill would simply be enshrining the current medical practice into law.
72. you don’t understand the risks pregnancy poses to women. You’re not at all thinking about the mother, whose life can very easily be taken if her baby is not viable. it WILL kill women forcing them to carry non viable fetus.
73. If you read the first paragraph of my reply, you'll see that I'm talking about terminations for medical reasons, which relates to babies which are absolutely not "perfectly healthy". You would do well to perhaps read up on the subject.
74. If you read the first paragraph of my reply, you'll see that I'm talking about terminations for medical reasons, which relates to babies which are absolutely not "perfectly healthy". You would do well to perhaps read up on the subject.
75. Forcing an oxygen tube into a tiny deformed dying fetus, or making doctors attempt CPR on an infant they know will not survive, is absolutely far more horrifying than a medical procedure to remove a small shapeless blob. No one is aborting fully formed, 'perfectly healthy' babies ffs Like be for fucking real lmfao
76. plausible only to fools. its obvious as hell to anyone with the brains of a flea
