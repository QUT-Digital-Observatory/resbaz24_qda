Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. Fascinating, isn’t it. Domestic and family violence at an all time high but LNP thinks criminalising women’s reproductive right is somehow going to help matters. When we know that it will only serve to keep women and children in dangerous situations.
2. No worries mate, but you should probably talk to someone about whatever it is that's going on. Probably do you some good
3. This is exactly right. The amount of cash being spent on renewable energy is insane. Back in about 2015 there was the fear of a huge downturn in the energy industry and the only thing that was going was the Surat gas basin, now with all of the solar and wind farms and pumped hydro there's so much investment and activity I don't know how they're going to do it all.
4. Exactly. Propping up those coal jobs , so your children will now have even less pathways to these new job types. Deferring the inevitable and selling out the future of the regions for a short term outcome that benefits only the top percent.
5. I’d rather vote democrats and greens tbh but I’m voting labour as the threat to female reproductive rights is too close to home for me
6. What red tape? You know regional qld gets far more spent on it per capita than SEQ. Unfortunately in such a spread out state you simply can’t provide the services and infrastructure that the locals want without spending billions and raising taxes. Any party who tells regional Queensland they can are lying.
7. What source do you have to confirm this is the way police are policing and that's why the youth crime stats are skewed Incorrectly?
8. Have a read of the statistics . Don’t take my word for it . It’s definitely a problem, but very complex and not solved by locking children up. Early intervention and robust social strategy works the best
9. Mate if the repeat offenders have turned 18, and there are not as many youth offenders replacing them, then that is a reduction in youth crime. “Youth” describes an age group, not specific people. How else would a reduction in youth crime look? If the fix is education and employment, then this is the best argument against an LNP government. The previous LNP government strip-mined education and health, which cratered employment in those sectors, which as you know, affects rural areas first. And they haven’t announced anything new to help either one. Meanwhile Labour has massively invested in education, particularly targeted to the regions that need it, and is creating thousands of new jobs in the energy sector by investing in infrastructure that will continue for long after you and I are dead. And it’s not just schools, they’re funding the shit out of TAFE and vocational training for kids that want to stay rural. None of what you want will be delivered by an LNP state government, in fact it will get worse, while Labour is already addressing your major complaints in ways you’re not aware of.
10. I totally agree , the problem starts well well well before these children start offending. Early intervention and social support strategies work the best and research supports this . Unfortunately, they take time and people want immediate solutions such as ‘ adult crime, adult time’ while slogans like this are catchy, it’s not based on evidence .
11. They haven't, the mainstream media have just run the perfect propaganda campaign against them, so detractors constantly think they've done something off putting recently.
12. No that's on me if I've worded that wrong, I'm terrible with words so that's my bad.
13. Yes, I like him. He is prepared to have a few big ideas. I'm very hopeful that he can turn this around.
14. The LNP are very bad, Labor is often bad, and the Greens are periodically bad too. It's just they do it for different reasons. - the LNP because of intention. - the ALP because of fear and pragmatism, and unwillingness to work to defeat the LNP. - the Greens because of idealism and impracticality and unwillingness to work to defeat the LNP. There is an enemy, but the Greens and Labor represent a divided answer to that shittiness. If they could present two visions for the future, and sell that there isn't one under the LNP, and stop punching each other and start punching the LNP and rightwing media, they might actually be able to do something. But uneasy allies are hard to trust and easy to backstab....
15. I didn't want to move my Greens preference down, but they have been behaving like a bunch of fringe loonies lately, so I put them down the bottom with One Nation. What an own goal on their part.
16. But Labor get plenty of graft on the unions and corruption and they arent on the side of business at all particularly small business which Labor introduce way to much red tape for small business to operate
17. Aw bless, you actually think the LNP will announce any policies before an election, especially one as controversial and vote cancelling as that.
18. A couple weeks ago, Katter put forward plans to repeal abortion laws. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-08/queensland-election-abortion-lnp-pressure-from-katter-party/104445154 It's only in the last few days that they've suddenly backtracked to an amendment regarding live births. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-22/robbie-katter-abortion-laws-queensland-election/104502092 So yes, there were statements regarding repealing abortions laws.
19. What is unsaid matters too. The LNP hasn’t stated that they won’t make any propositions regarding abortion laws either.
20. "Katter's Australian Party (KAP) leader Robbie Katter says his party will put an abortion repeal bill back into Queensland parliament "quick as you like" after the election." https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.abc.net.au/article/104450992#cobssid=s First hit on Google when I searched "KAP abortion"
21. They haven't written it yet. They announced their intention to do it. You can google the dozens of articles about it if you want more details.
22. You have your opinion based on a betting company 🤣🤣🤣
23. Because some rich cunts have been muddying the water to make people think that the LNP and Labor have similar policies and a fresh LNP face will bring positive change for the state. Except they don't mention the fresh face is the same dude responsible for firing health workers and lining his and his mates pockets at QLDs expense.
24. So your entire argument is based around something you have absolutely zero evidence of whatsoever, and claim that can never be shown to be happening? Source of evidence for the supposed youth crime crisis: just trust me bro. Classic LNP voter.
25. Really hope your just trying to troll at this point and not actually like that coz holy fuck you need to take a chill pill

27. You have one party saying "i am going to rip out renewables and put in new coal fire plants" and one party saying "we want to feed children at school" and you're like "how can i tell these two apart?". Good luck
28. It’s not even federal vs state. It’s global issues that that parties point their fingers at each other about as though the ALP government in QLD has caused a global cost of living crisis…
29. And DV is at the top of the list of crimes committed by police...
30. It's not just that there's money being spent on it from a government perspective (I don't think that's what you mean though). We are uniquely positioned to be a global leader in renewables, both in terms of energy production as well as manufacturing all the components that go into it. Yes, there are elements of mining that are also required - industries that already exist, yet most of the focus is on shitty coal mining and propping big polluters up. We have every single element to be at the forefront of this market. This has every chance to make our poorest areas significantly wealthier, and create tens of thousands of secure, well paying local jobs across dozens of fields and industries as well as revitalize our massively under There aren't many investments that any government can make that are going to have anywhere near the returns that QLD is looking at - and a decent amount of this funding is coming directly from a very modest tax mining companies. Voting against this plan is literally taking money away from the regions and giving it straight to coal companies on multiple fronts - which largely gets sent overseas instead of contributing to the areas they're extracting the resources from.
31. We have preferential voting. There's nothing stopping you putting greens 1st and labor 2nd.
32. This is the way all crime and cases are reported on, not just youth crime. It’s why police are intent on getting you to drop or close the case so they don’t have to do work on it and it doesn’t impact their numbers/KPIs.
33. I agree with you here. People say all sorts of shit about the Greens based on what they hear in the media, then when called on it they usually come up with nothing.
34. What cuckservatives call “red tape” I call “not treating your workers like disposable garbage or possibly maiming/killing them” and “not maximising profit at the expense of everybody else as well as future generations.” What cuckservatives call “union grift” I call “looking after the working class”
35. Well, Katter tabled a bill amendment…. So, I take it there is no actual evidence of them saying that then, and reddit is just a propaganda echo chamber? Because; that’s what it’s looking like.
36. Thanks. I hadn’t seen that first link, I’d like to see what he exactly said though, not just a few random quotes to fit a narrative. Though, I would believe Katter would do away with abortion laws if he could. I support pro-choice, but I do not like that but happens. And I’m not religious. As for the second link, that was his position earlier this year, and the bill he put to parliament back in May(?).
37. I’ve googled for a long time. I see a lot of out of context quotes and insinuations. I’m yet to see anything that shows the LNP wanting to “ban abortions”. Could you link one for me if you know where they are?
38. You'll understand why in less than 48 hours. Bookies know what they're doing
39. I’ve already voted and didn’t vote LNP - so what now? And even if I had, this elitist pompous attitude is exactly what’s wrong with today. You aren’t better than someone because of an opposing political view. Your ad hominem is pretty standard on here for people not fully agreeing with every single ALP shill point of view though. Your stats are based around a unionised workforce strongly aligned with ALP and who have a keen interest to make their KPIs look better than reality as well. I’m sure we’d all trust mining and environmental data coming from a LNP aligned source, right? Good one.
40. Comparing the multibillion dollar energy grid, (you can’t “rip out renewables” either) to a $15m lunches program. You are the exact type of naive voter the majors play on because your vote is so cheap to buy….
41. The evidence is in past performance, with sneaky bills passed in late night sittings.
42. If the KAP has gone from that May bill to "We will, quick as you like, put a repeal bill back into the Queensland parliament on those abortion laws," in October, it's cause for concern. Notably, KAP's newsroom doesn't appear to have posted anything this month on the topic. I also couldn't find anything from May. They have the power to publish statements in their own words, without "random quotes to fit a narrative" and they have chosen not to. However, here's them accusing the government of appealing to the "woke brigade" for making abortion access easier. https://kap.org.au/abortion-access-expansion-rings-alarm-bells/ Here's them bemoaning the expansion of abortion access, saying "the government is proclaiming its wonderful work ending the lives of more Queenslanders". https://kap.org.au/brisbane-government-confirms-support-to-kill-off-rural-towns-katter/ This one is about the live abortions amendment that they're seeking. Not opposing abortion, but the language used is a red flag. “I challenge the LNP to own up to the people of Queensland – are they God-fearing defenders of our faith and of the fundamental human rights of babies, or are they as complicit as the Labor party and the Greens in their slide down the woke slope?” Mr Katter said. https://kap.org.au/katter-asks-is-the-legal-killing-of-babies-now-lnp-alp-policy/ KAP's attitude on the topic of abortion fits an agenda to repeal abortion laws.
43. Explained in that article and above. Occam's razor is if a bill is introduced to repeal the 2018 laws, and the Liberals do a conscience vote again it's almost a certainty of the Bill passing.
44. Reading your comments is tiring, as you are just simply being ignorant. Do you need information fed to you with a spoon and train noises? The fact is, if you are not able to piece together the situation from the large amount of various sources, video and audio recordings, interviews, debates and press conferences, mixed with some common sense, then no amount of demanding the "evidence" will produce something that will change your mind.
45. I'm sure the death of the qld economy brings much joy to you
46. An elitist pompous attitude of....looking for what the facts are, listening to actual experts in the field and paying attention to objective reality rather than literally making shit up after believing political spin because it fits your world view? Ok pal. That isn't a 'political view'. That is believing in absolute bullshit because it doesn't require you to admit that parts of your worldview might be, shock horror, based on nothing but unsupported opinions that don't stand up to any sort of critical reflection.
47. That does not say, anywhere that the LNP said they want to ban abortion….. actually the opposite.
48. What is it with you guys who demand evidence while obviously supporting a party that lies and obfuscates and sneaks around. Go and find your own evidence, mate. It's called Google.
49. A party that lies? You mean all of them? The irony 😂
50. Off you pop now, you've got your quota of down votes and done your little stir for the day. You can go and tell the right wing forums about how you wound up the radical lefties on reddit. Such a laugh and so easy. SDE.
51. You know when a Bill is introduced to the Parliament all members need to vote on it right?
52. Yes, but that isn’t what I asked. I asked where the LNP said they want to ban abortions…..
53. They have been asked over 100 times and have NOT given a response to the question. Last time they voted on it, they almost unanimously voted to NOT decrminalise it. This isn't very complicated. If they were against changing the law, they would come out and say that they would vote against any Bill out forward by KAP. They haven't done that.
54. Everything we’ve worked for. Hydro, hydrogen plan, solar. All seemingly going down the toilet. How sad.
55. The vast majority of their funding has come from coal miners. Gee, I wonder why they're shutting down renewables?
56. Such a critical few years coming up, Queensland was already so far behind and has nearly caught up to a respectable position...
57. are we really surprised to find out that the party of religious zealots will do nothing to prevent "the rapture"? to them, the demise of humanity due to climate change is the end times that they welcome with open arms. these are the moments where they live large and squeeze every last cent out of anything with value - especially if it accelerates the next mass extinction.
58. All of their lies about supporting renewable energy aside... How'd this one get past the keeper? *"The Coaldrake Review was scathing of the government's obsession with outsourcing work to the private sector and how this has eroded the public service.* *We've long argued that building capacity in the public service and empowering it to manage projects will drive down project overruns and ultimately reduce cost-of-living pressures for Queenslanders."* You fired 14,000 public servants last time you had power, you fucks. The shortfall in staffing was filled by... CONSULTANTS!!! Many of them were the very people you fired, but they could demand a higher pay as an outsourced consultant that would never return as employees. That eroded the public service. You fucking fuck-knuckled shitfuckers.
59. Fuck this guy, he better not get in. Up here in Gladstone there are constant Semi Trailer loads of solar panels heading west for the solar farms, need to keep this happening. Grrr
60. Coal loving conservatives with mates in the coal industry aren't gonna fund the transition away from coal. Colour me absolutely fucking shocked. Fuck the planet, as long as a bunch of fucking conservatives can get rich, right?
61. It’s not surprising to hear the LNP will not be supporting the green energy plan. Supporting the LNP tomorrow is voting to protect a handful of ‘dirty energy’ capitalists. That is a vote against our children’s future, and the health of our environment.
62. “While the Labour government plans to borrow $176.25bn to fund its election commitments, the LNP’s promises would be paid for by capping growth in consultancy spending.” Add this to the mountain of typical editorial oppsies by News Corp that just happen to lie (pun intended) in their favor. (No one is planning to borrow $176bn fucking dollars)
63. I don't understand how they expect to save money from reducing external consultants, when they have promised to increase the number of pubic consultants with expertise and similar salaries in the public service. If you just switch from private to public at similar wages, then there will be savings on profit and overhead, but not nearly as much as they are promising. And I simply don't trust them. They were the ones who gutted the public service the last time they were in power, whose ideology is that the private sector always does better than the public sector in providing services. This policy flies in the face of their stated ideology, and won't save what they are saying in the first place. It is ludicrous.
64. But don’t worry guys, at least we’re going to lock up a bunch of kids despite research showing that does fuck all to reduce youth crime
65. Who is surprised that the LNP hates climate change action?
66. The sad part is that by 2028 the positive changes will be locked in. One more term and Queensland will meet targets into the future.
67. No plans to actually do anything. Just Labor isn't doing enough. Seriously, If I was an LNP supporter I'd be fucking pissed with how they behave.
68. To be honest, a lot of regional farmer and community don’t care if it’s green or black electricity, they just want cheaper and more affordable as they are cutting meal already.
69. I don’t have any interest in renewable energies, but I’d really like to know why a state with so much coal is still charging its residents for electricity at all.
70. I would like to see a proper AGC for Queensland (doubtful they’ll do it) but it’s a pretty slim benefit. It’s like getting fucked in the ass with a spiked dildo but being expected to have a smile on your face because they gave you a cookie afterwards.
71. And at a pretty critical time to get ahead on hydrogen generation to be a lead producer throughout Asia. We should be a world leader in green hydrogen production. We should be producing excess green energy and selling it to the world. We can't just sell Coal forever and hope that our third world style economy will keep us trucking. Oh well let's hand more of that to China. Like we have battery production which we should also be a world leader in.
72. But mining companies will send more money offshore so we've got that going for us which is nice.
73. Labor have big plans for Gladstone in the future this would totally fuck the entire town
74. There would a lot of savings in the switch from private to public in not doing unnecessary work just to rake in more fees
75. I'm afraid it's too late to counter the relentless media and corporate lies
76. Exactly the LNP do have a plan but they're not brave enough to share it with us yet and it involves staying on coal while pushing Spuds nuclear fantasy as the only "realistic" solution.
77. Go harder. There’s a beautiful depth of expression to be found in compound expletives.
78. That the LNP costings are released two days from the election became good enough reason for me to swap back to ALP. Then the coal royalties wind back, the abortion debacle, the $200000, the privatisation of ambulances and schools, along with Crisafulli’s inability to withstand any pressure, and the fact that no matter how this election transpires, Crisafulli’s leadership is on a shaky foundation make the LNP unelectable.
79. His just released budget is proposing to cut $6.8 billion from public services, so Campbell Newman 2.0 incoming.
80. The fact that this guy is even being considered, is just a fucking horrible reflection on Queenslanders.
81. Gonna be a divisive election, for sure. I hate to say it but this feels like the first election I've ever experienced in this country where I will lose respect for someone that votes differently to me. It's such an obvious choice, if you vote for this shit stain you must be either extremely stupid, extremely greedy or both.
82. Will LNP stop the coal royalties? I’ve seen that money do a lot of good and i’m worried if they’re going to give it back to their pals
83. Based on comments from my neighborhood Facebook page I can tell you why those local to me are voting LNP. Our neighborhood gets lots of door checking, car theft and break ins, with security cam footage often shared. The sentiment seems to be that they're getting away with it and nobody is doing anything about crime so they want LNP in because they're "tough on crime." The facts don't support this. It's not objectively the right take. But when we see it all happening in our neighborhood on literally a weekly basis I can get why people are gonna feel that way and get sucked into the narrative.
84. I’m in the same boat as you, I’m a kiwi who can’t vote(been here 20 years this year) and I’m super invested in this election. I’m fearful for the future for Queenslanders if this potato head gets in.
85. I will never vote for the LNP. The damage they have done in the last 10 years is pretty much irreparable yet people want to sit and blame labor for LNP mishaps. 🤦🏼‍♀️ From attempting to criminalise abortion… to public service cuts (which includes healthcare and as a nurse the healthcare system is already as strained as it’s going to get… anymore and there will be many more preventable deaths) …. I am also half tempted to drop being a nurse and engage in politics to see if I could change anything 😂
86. Stephen Miles gave all QLDers 50c public transport fares, $1000 energy rebate and a discount on car rego.
87. Two reasons I can think of why people will vote for him (and LNP in general) 1) Rupert Murdoch and his buddies owns this country (particularly QLD because we only have the Courier Mail here). They make and break politicians. A LNP politician *really* has to fuck up to get bad press. 2) Australians vote aspirationally (if that’s a word). They won’t vote for policies that will demonstrably benefit them right now, they’ll vote for policies that will benefit rich people because one day *they’ll* be the rich ones with 50 investment properties and so many franking credits, and they won’t want to pay taxes when that happens. Any day now… Edit: I’m talking about the LNP in general, at all levels of government. I know that franking credits and negative gearing are federal policies 🤦‍♀️. Holy shit you guys like to miss the forest for the trees
88. LNP literally about to cut everything that made QLD great and function amazingly compared to other states during COVID. Thanks fuckwits. You're really going to fuck QLD up.
89. I hang my head in shame. Everything this pin dick and his party stands for turns my stomach.
90. What bothers me is that it’s basically just voting for a change because…change?? No real reason just people are bored?
91. We are dreading the thought. The polls suggest he’ll win but I’m hoping against all reason they’re wrong. I’ll put the LNP last on my ballot
92. Surely we’ve enough commonsense to not go the LNP route, right? Right guys?!
93. Not from Australia, but am a citizen, so I'm doing my part to keep him out of our lives. I gotcha
94. Same reason that anyone in the US can vote for Trump - the conservative Kool-Aid is very potent indeed.
95. Anyone else getting those disturbing voice mails from this guy?
