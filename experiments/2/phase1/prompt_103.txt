Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. Queensland has very few thermal coal mines. This isn’t one of them.
2. everyone was benefiting from it, not just this made up brigade you are so scared of lol
3. I work in coal mines. This isn’t an issue of if coal mines should exist or not. This is about whether a coal company should pay its fair share in taxes and be held to account for the death of workers on its mine sites. Edit: and also if it should be allowed to enforce a fifo/dido only policy
4. I want to highlight the company is also advocating for the destruction of a rural town.
5. Maybe if you had paid attention to the fact that they were doing ALL OF THAT you may not have been sucked into the Coal Company lies.
6. It's pretty silly to say reducing coal royalties is going to help qlders. City or country. It's just rent seeking wrapped up concern for the regoins
7. You know now that the LNP is going to do NOTHING to help Queenslanders - only line their pockets and pay back the favours that it owes. At least SEQ were getting something, and potentially additional money to support schools and health, who knows. Now the massive corporations and billionaires get to keep the money. This is why we can’t have nice things. Cut off our nose despite our face. Great work.
8. Majority of this coal is shipped overseas. Including all the coal from this mine.
9. No it’s not. That’s the grid of yesterday and it’s shit. The grid of tomorrow’s on demand, fast response rate, distributed geographically and by size/type, and backed with storage.
10. They ought to be. It’s logical unless we want to go down the slippery slope to outright baksheesh/corruption
11. He didn't explain who these "people" are. Certainly not the people getting electricity rebates or school lunch or taking public transport.
12. Hold them actually accountable for each and every worker injury and death.
13. No wonder they kept saying election promises would be funded by debt
14. Yeah but they do this thing where they zoom right in to where it goes up and say "SEE IT WENT UP! DONE" op was deleted before I chimed in tho, I know what went down. Seen it a million times.
15. Two fatalities in 6 weeks is symptomatic of a corporate culture that doesn’t give a shit about safety. The rumours I heard about the second are tragic, but other mines have controls in place that could have reduced the likelihood. And still… this whole thing reeks of “our friends got in and will help defund and defang the inspector, so we can get away with more”. Get ready for it.
16. As someone who has worked onsite the drive of 15 to 30 minutes has never been so bad as the companies I worked for as they had decent buses and reduced seating capacity on smaller buses because you can't empty a bus in a hurry if it is too cramped. It's interesting that the workers determined that they needed better conditions also.
17. I think if qcoal wants to operate a mine in the area. Then absolutely it should. Its original camp was only built to be used for the mine’s construction. They have known since the beginning they would have to support the town. They why the council denied their application to expand the camp.
18. So move closer or work at a different mine. And that's a disingenuous claim anyway. You're not making the 8 hour drive every day. An office worker commuting to work an hour each way in Brisbane is doing more driving to work in any given month anyway.
19. Cool thanks for defending them, We should continue to increase royalties on resource extraction until it reaches 70% of total income on any given year. If Mining and gas companies want to operate in Australia, they need to be paying there fair share back to Australians.
20. Would the market being flooded with coal drive the price down? Could the mines now slow production and drive the price back up once the LNP removes the royalty mechanism?
21. My bet is by 2030, BMA is spun into its own standalone business on the ASX. Too much remaining demand & mine life to shutdown, too much infrastructure to sell to another player.
22. Is it better or worse for the State of Qld if mining companies pay more royalties?
23. Aww but the boomers and single minded organisms take pleasure in throwing their idiocy level ideology around on LinkedIn, they’d be basking in idiot praise!
24. I did say shut them down you smooth brain troll. If they’re so profitable then the state taking them, running them at cost and exporting then what the problem?
25. Because unions do their own advertising. Don't have to donate then.
26. Active is the word you are missing. We have tons of coal we can mine.
27. Not scared of them, just think there are better things to spend my time on
28. That's where we're headed if we don't get the media monopoly in this country under control.
29. From 1 July 2024, all households receive $1000 off their energy bills in 2024–25, funded by coal royalties. Look for the ‘Queensland Government Cost of Living Rebate’ on your bill. The electricity rebate is being funded from coal royalties. How about everyone opposed to taking profits from coal mining show some character and refuse to apply for the assistance!
30. Implement national laws around executive salaries and bonuses being tied to workers pay and bonuses. No more than ___% or something.
31. Please cite your references because not only does the Australian government disagree with you expecting prices to further decline in 2025 but so does the world bank. [coal price outlook](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/opendata/coal-market-developments--falling-prices-amid-record-high-output)
32. Yeah they’re not .. long term forecast is well below $150/t
33. Why, I thought the world was not keen to use coal?
34. Nice one. One incorrect "fact" after another. Your ignorance of the coal mining industry, pricing, tax take and commodity outlook is showing.
35. I’ve seen credible info on the second one. What can you do? Old mate has a medical episode and then drives into a greenie dumpie operator that’s a few weeks on the job. Like you can’t eliminate a random medical episode. The first one was a classic misunderstanding of what a crane is actually good for and cowboy antics I agree.
36. Yeah but it was Queensland LABOR resources minister Scott Stewart that approved the camp. This whole thread is trying to twist albeit a stupid statement from QCoal into an election whinge. [ABC article on Glenden, Glencore and Qcoal](https://amp.abc.net.au/article/102672746)
37. An office worker isn’t doing a 12 hour shift of physical labour in harsh conditions.
38. Unfortunately, I’m not the only person in my household with a job. I can’t just force my wife to abandon her career. That would be a dick move. And no jobs where I live pay what I earn here. Not really sure how that’s a disingenuous claim. I’m still driving 8 hours to get to the site. Why would I want to do an extra 40minutes X 7 days on top of that?
39. My wife had a career as well. Can’t just make her move can I.
40. To where? If you went to Mackay it’s still a solid 2-3 hour drive. If you’re at say, Home Hill, that’s still 3-4 hours. Bowen is 2-3.
41. I think you’ll find a mine like Qcoal would just shutdown. They’re allready operating at slim margins. Efficient miners like BMA are only mining at a cost of $100/T and actively selling their assets to smaller miners like Whitehaven and Stanmore. How could you tax them at 70% of INCOME rather than the current 15% like you suggested and they be viable companies ? You would shut railways down and all the associated towns.
42. The mines will shut, paying no royalties & providing no jobs in regional QLD - did you not have to do some economics at school?
43. Not really it’s not like oil. China produces 3BT a year and use it nearly all themselves we do 0.5BT and mainly sell to Japan and Korea as a bit of a stop gap. It’s not a market Australia has huge influence on.
44. I shared the link to the prices and to the royalties, please tell me how ?
45. I think you’re spot on ever since Rio Tinto left QLD and sold themselves as the “green” non coal miner, BMA, Glencore and Anglo are left with these toxic publicity assets that no one wants to be associated with except for the little miners who don’t care that QLD has a lot of now.
46. Is it better or worse for the tens of thousands of people who rely on the mining industry if it goes away?
47. Oh, you mean "siezed", not "ceased". Sorry, I was speaking English. Not whatever language you used. Also, I assume you meant to say, "I DIDN'T say shut them down". It's hard work understanding you when you can't spell and don't type what you mean.
48. Even if we accept that false premise, Nine, News Corp, and the mining sector have way more reach and money, along with a greater influence over the LNP.
49. Tones is an understatement. I would argue majority of the coal mined in Queensland would be wasted on coal fired power plants and most of it is Met coal used for steal making being sold overseas. The only way we see a benefit is via taxation
50. You should be well aware then that fifo workers and on site mining camps actively hurt local businesses. This isn’t even a camp in a town. You HAVE to stay on site during your swing and are bussed directly to the airport. I grew up in regional Queensland. I moved because the local mine shut. Edit: I also want to highlight a small town called collinsville. A perfect example of the problem.
51. Literally in the budget - bet you can’t tell me what the LNP budget is. They didn’t even have one
52. As opposed to nothing at all from the LNP, other than “oh we will do the same”
53. Hydroelectric power is cheaper, the dams last 100 years or more and its clean doesnt cause dire health issues in the workers, is reliable and maintenance is cheaper, doesnt require tearing up the earth and transpoting materials and can be backed by other cheaper renewables like solar and wind. Geothermal is another cheaper one the trircky part is finding reliable vents near population/transporting the power is also consistent. But the same exploration is required to find and dig for coal and that needs to be constant by comparison.
54. Oh, yeah. Too late there. Given one of the pillars of democracy is a free press, not a monopoly or duopoly owned by billionaires, we can no longer say we’re a democratic country. These interests and lobby groups are totally out of control now. The whole thing needs to be shut down, shaken up and restarted. We need a model like some of the western European countries instead of America lite or whatever it is we are becoming. The jerks at the top are now white anting the middle classes. This new government doesn’t have much left after Newmann’s spree to sell off to their mates or privatise. But they’ll leave this state looking like a crater covered in coal dust and dead species, fringed with a filthily polluted ocean. We should go the UAE route, get real about resources being finite and invest in tourism and polishing up our natural environment or we’ll end up with a place even the Chinese won’t envy. Maybe that’s the point?
55. Headed? We’ve been there since AT LEAST Howard… Australians *should* be the wealthiest nation in the world *by far*. The shortsighted nature of its politicians and the dishearteningly ignorant (often belligerently so) electorate have squandered unbelievable sums of material wealth and all we have to show for it are…… incredibly expensive property prices, in what is one of the most sparsely populated countries on Earth. It’s pathetic.
56. How much is the coal industry making stripping our natural resources? I'll trade that $1000 per person per year for their actual profits. Who do you think would come out on top?
57. A small benefit from a broken system doesn't make that system immune to criticism. How about the mining companies show character first and take their social licence to operate seriously?
58. First off, no one applied for the assistance, it was automatic. Secondly, if someone is going to profit from minerals ripped from the ground, surely it should be all of us and not just the mining companies?
59. Happy to as long as my children, grand children, great…. can sue you and the coal companies for thieving their futures.
60. #inconvenientFacts But the fact this has to happen is completely fucked to start with
61. That moneys going away anyway so what does it even matter at this point 🙏
62. I know so many pensioners (through my mother) in Maryborough and Hervey Bay that voted LNP claiming the health care system failed them. It’s going to be interesting seeing the leopard eat their faces when their next electricity bill comes through without the rebate or when LNP eventually cut more healthcare jobs or privatise Ergon Energy.
63. It’s not being funded from royalties. The last Budget shows the government going into deficit this financial year (when the rebates are introduced). It’s being funded from debt.
64. A lot of executives are paid very well, but not all industries have strong unions.
65. Who controls the supply of coal that helps drive the price down below the magical $150/t?
66. Again, just going off the rumours… HV/LV separation for a start. But yes pretty tragic. No one wants to die at work.
67. Never worked where you are but worked on multiple metals and minerals minesites around Australia and SE Asia in both operations and construction. Coal is known for its issues with safety in Qld specifically - they’re rather an arrogant bunch to deal with as they are long tied to Joh and the LNP and resist regulation. So, yes, I raised the safety issue as a little poke - but people keep going to work there and the accidents and black lung continue in spite of attempts to bring in more regulatory checks and balances. Coal mining is cowboy territory. In construction of coal mining facilities the construction companies do much better on safety… actual their better on safety across the board.
68. He approved the camp for construction faze only. Hence why qcoal has lost 3 legal challenges. https://www.statedevelopment.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0023/22658/byerwen-coal-project-2019-annual-report-to-the-coordinator-general.pdf

70. I haven't even stopped using Electricity and Steel that's only possible from Coal... why does that mean I can't point out the direct impact to lives? A question that *you yourself* asked?
71. Minor context. I don’t believe the mine should shut down its existing camp as fifo/dido workers are essential for any mine in those remote area. I do believe qcoal should support the local town and its know its had to since the mine was first approved back in 2015.
72. Qcoal's CEO received $575m in dividends for the year ended 2023 and in the months that followed. He's worth around $2billion so I think they'd be ok with his support.
73. Coal needs to go, no loss there then, Maybe if they want a short future they can cut down the on the insane C-Suite salaries to increase profitability.
74. Yeah man I’m sure they’ll go elsewhere to get resources. They’ll whine but never leave, and if they magically leave then we’re better off without them
75. "*did you not have to do some economics at school?*" Did you not learn that we have resources they want so they won't go away and at the end of the day Losing out on Coal and gas isn't an issue it needs to go anyway. They only complain and whine to whoever will listen, they never leave as at the end of the day we always have what they want.
76. HA yeah cute.. guess they can go to all the other places... oh wait they either tax far higher or dont exisit. What a joke
77. All I can say is bravo.🤣 Nice to see someone else who understands the industry actually commenting not the average 17 year old here.
78. You're question has been answered by other Redditors. And you blatantly ignored it. Also you work in civil engineering. My guess is in mining.
79. Indeed. Metallurgical Coal is still important… but leave it much longer it’ll become a stranded asset that gets usurped by other steel making methods.
80. Again, an LNP voter trying to put words in my mouth.
81. Technically yeah actually, you can burn them as biomass, or process them into ethanol and burn that. It’s not unreasonable to criticise appeals to populism with phrases that are emotive nonsense like “mining is for the people” or similar. You could also potentially be a bit more open to understandable criticism of coal specifically when we know we should stop using it, though sure “you can’t eat coal” is rather irrelevant in this circumstance.
82. $120B in profit for miners in QLD and you reckon (a) none of that should go to helping the public, and (b) the mining industry would "go away" because of a cut to the state. As for "if you don't need the royalties", there are millions of people who benefit from the mining royalties, who speaks for them? You?
83. I suppose. Union memberships are a lot lower these days...
84. Sure… and slave labor camps no doubt turn a profit as well. Of course there’s no way a decent person would take a hand out form a company which profited in such a way. If you take this handout you are undeniably comprising your moral opposition to coal mining.
85. Agreed! If only had stayed the hell away from energy policy.
86. All fair points. And don’t get me wrong. I do not believe Qcoal actually care about us. All I’m saying is that I don’t want to drive an extra 40 minutes a day when we have a perfectly serviceable camp 5 minutes away. I’d rather decompress by having a shower and a beer with my crew and calling my family than sitting on a bus for 40 minutes a day. As for black lung, that’s an underground mining issue. Don’t really see cases in open cut.
87. From the article in 2023 (below) vs your document from 2019 “Some weeks later I received a phone call from Queensland Minister for Resources Scott Stewart,” she said. “He informed me of his preliminary approval of a 450-bed workforce camp on QCoal’s mining lease. “My heart sank, my blood boiled and all I could feel was the heartache for the residents of Glenden.”
88. I feel eventually they should just be called reality deniers since they all seem to think they're living in a different one then the rest of us
89. Have you ever been to Glenden? I’m being serious. The fact you’re suggesting it shows you’ve never been. There’s no essential services, a servo that’s open half the time, the ghost of a community centre, a bar/pub/corner store (that is never stocked with anything) that’s run by backpackers from Blackdowns. It’s barely liveable and if you need groceries, medicine or quite literally anything, you need to drive to Mackay or Bowen. Not to mention if you move, what’s your partner going to do for work?
90. So sell coal at roughly the current $150 a tonne but pay 70% on it rather than 15%. So you get $45/T on coal that costs you +$100/T to get out of the ground and onto a ship. Byerwin can do 10Mt, so you want Chris Wallin the CEO who grew up, still lives in Brisbane and developed the mine to lose $550m per year ???? Yeah I don’t think they will be ok…..
91. He’s the owner which is the reason for the massive amount he got paid - was also effectively a one off.
92. So how do you propose we make steel then ? Which QLD coal is predominantly used for.
93. If the government takes 70% of their revenue they will 100% leave - they’ll be bankrupt. How are we better off without them? No jobs, no royalties.
94. How does the government generate royalties without coal & gas?
95. So you’re saying the coal price hasn’t dropped and labor’s royalty policy wasn’t for coal over $150/T ?
96. Still trying incorrectly to work out who I voted for.
97. I'm saying you trivialised miners as a pittance of the population and downplayed the any effects on them as a relatively small number of people. "So...1% of QLD" I'm saying if they don't matter that much to you, then get stuffed and don't rely on the fruits of their labour. Without them, you wouldn't have mining, or royalties. That 1% is keeping you afloat, champ.
98. Work Choices killed them. We're just seeing the death rattles.
99. My original comment wasn’t directed at Qcoal (that’s why I edited it to clarify)
100. USA, UK are 2 Democratic developed countries with the EXACT same issues of housing and inflation. Is QLD Labor at fault for nearly 500M people having the same issue? At least the QLD Labor Government had world class initiatives to curb the cost of living pressures without raising inflation. USA, UK and the rest of Australia are getting 2 buttons and a dance from their governments.
101. Housing prices would need federal laws to take action on. Not a state issue. Inflation is also up all over the developed world; not a state issue. Now instead of those policies benefitting the populace, the mining companies and big business get to benefit in the name of trickle down economics. We know how that works. Something will trickle down to the poor from the wealthy, but it won't be money.
102. LNP voter has no idea about the differences between state, federal and international issues. Colour me shocked. Do you really have no understanding of the massive interstate migration we experienced because of how good our state was being run vs the ones down south? People voted in Campbell Newman in 2012 probably thinking the same thing after the 2008 financial crisis killed productivity. The whole state took a nose dive with still lasting impacts on the health system he left us with. LNP voters don’t learn from history though do they
103. Delivered nothing except massive state revenue from progressive coal royalties that were opposed by the opposition, had the best gains in Australia in terms of economic productivity, jobs growth and personal income gains, given some of the best childcare subsidies in Australia, delivered below national average inflation, given a significant boost to first home buyers in order to assist with housing. Our land price and rents aren’t double the other states, the growth we have has been higher than the other states but it’s still cheaper to buy a house here than in nsw or Melbourne. That was part of the appeal for young southerners moving up here. Land zoning and building permits is not under state government genius, it’s local government ie the LNP run council. Turns out you literally don’t understand anything that you’re complaining about. Surprise surprise Edit: I see you deleted the comment lololol
104. “My government”? Do you live in Queensland? If you do then it was your government too dickhead. My point, which you failed to address, if the promises were empty why did the opposition also make them? Were they also making false promises? Or were the promises only empty based on who was speaking? Mate, you seem like a low information, big opinion loudmouth. As to brags for QLD labor, hows about **coal royalties**?
105. So you're saying slave labour camps are morally on the same level as coal mining?
106. Haha. I’d take the odds that none of them would refuse the hand out. Lol
107. The numbers of people with black lung in any type of coal mining has long been know to be refused by the mining companies. No scientific basis for the pushback. The science and medical record says that it’s happening in open cut as well as underground mines. Like asbestos and tobacco the mining companies don’t want to admit to the issue our take accountability for the outcomes. All the more reason to tax them harder and put money back into healthcare and other services to deal with the aftermath.
108. What is the drive for? Is it to keep a local town alive or something?
109. You know that it was approved back in 2015? Not 2023?
110. So we're shifting the goal posts now? No-one talked about shutting down an entire industry. Is there any reason you're unable to discuss the direct impact to lives, a topic you opened, in good faith?
