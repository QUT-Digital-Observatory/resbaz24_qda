Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. You are 100% correct with 99% of your post. Most Conservatives support him because they don't even think of that. They are all about racism and controlling women (putting them back in the kitchen), and religion. Religion is the strongest in a Conservative...and Trump has a cult of religious freaks. More people should be thinking about the majority of your post. WE ARE IN DANGER as an ally of the USA. That's the actual point of why so many are freaking out about him possibly being in power. He will bow down to Putin and Xi and with this brings danger to any alliance and to Europe because of that. If USA joins the enemy , we are all done for.
2. Trump also doesn't support Israel. We got lots of them types here.
3. They can have Townsville as far as I'm concerned ^^^/s
4. Generally speaking the attraction to Trump is libidinal, not intellectual.
5. Yeah they would. They would view and frame it differently to you or just disagree with your view/ opinion outright.
6. I am an Australian living in USA and I will be voting for Trump to win. Reason is simple: I’m middle class and I believe Trump will be better for the economy. All the points you’ve mentioned are international relations. American voters are like Australians and will vote mostly with their bank accounts in mind
7. FMD - I have the total opposite view of trump and what it means for Australia… inflation is running rampant because the democratic war machine keeps financing conflicts abroad - take me back to 2016-2020 when the world wasn’t at war
8. Ukraine is a massive money laundering operating that has been used by the CIA for decades.
9. You do know that our alliance with the U.S. is non reciprocal, right?
10. Do they just draw an extra box at the bottom how do you do that
11. Most of them don't think that deeply. They will just do whatever they're told and believe whatever their algorithim shows them without any critical thinking at all.
12. He's not even the only man, or fit for the job, though.
13. Bro his wife is his dom that high heels been up his ass it’s so obvious if you think about it
14. God I wish they’d actually put him under some pressure. “Hey bunch of orders 5x small, 5x medium **MACHINES BEEPING** *unintelligible* large. Oh by the way one of the fryers is broken, you’re low on seasoning dunno where that is. The guy you were meant to be working with is running 40 minutes late… also you’ll be training Lisa here *gestures to the smallest woman you’ve ever seen who on the verge of tears*. Milkshake machine is up, but we are out of chicken. **random lady screaming at staff as a group of 10 teenagers walk in**. “WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE FRIES THERE’S SEVEN CARS IN THE DRIVE-THRU!” *lisa starts crying*.
15. Would be better to add a sticker over the caption and leave it there for a while so the cooker doesnt come back and add another one (or more). I'm thinking we workshop text to go over the bottom part.
16. Wow! What a relic. 2016 Matt Walsh making some sense! Reminds me of when Elon Musk used to be somewhat cool in the public eye, Right Wing media is a hell of a drug! Not even once, kids.
17. Maybe David Crisafulli considering it’s the state election on Saturday. Should put one up for the rep
18. You should look up what cognitive dissonance is before saying it. All of your comments have a nice helping of self-serving bias though.
19. > Thousands of immigrant children have been separated from family and sold as sex slaves...at the border. Wasn't that [specifically a Trump Administration order](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-a-trump-era-policy-that-separated-thousands-of-migrant-families-came-to-pass) to separate Children/Parents? The rest of your post is just as much waffle and bullshit... and I doubt you'll engage truthfully or in good faith. So I'll just leave this here and not further engage.
20. I doubt it was an American. The type of yank that would put up this sticker is unlikely to even have a passport.
21. I wish, we had that shit during the Bush years too. It was gross.
22. Yep, social media stretches beyond borders. Half these losers don't even know anything about Trump but they're so desperate to be a part of something they fully buy into the MAGA nonsense. It's insane.
23. I mean, social media has definitely made everything so much worse, but this this always seems to happen when fascism in on the rise overseas. Australia had its fair share of rabid Hitler fanbois back in the 1930's too. The nutbag who famously gatecrashed the official opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge on horseback with a sword was one, for instance.
24. Too dumb and lazy to research anything. Try to sound 'informed' by just parroting what is fed to them on social media.
25. Only thing I’d like to be more like America about is have access to guns easier than this crappy system we have now But since most states restrict the hell out of them now anyway that’s kinda moot
26. Yeah when I saw that I was like “ merrrrrica “
27. Religion is also behind a lot of funding...and they want their control back.
28. You seriously think Liberals are less racist then the further right parties ? I think not...Liberals are steam rolling towards Nationalism themselves and I could see a merge more than anything. I could see KAP, Palmer United, Nationals , Liberals merging but One Nation couldn't cope with being part of a group.
29. Name 3 good things he's doing in general and one that affects Australia in any way
30. even better - from what I've seen in the US polls over the years the actual hardcore Maga base is pretty consistently in the low 30 percent
31. I can't recall if there was a state breakdown but I'd not be surprised if that was the case given some of Qld current and past political figures
32. There is no denying that poll . You would not believe how many love that asswipe...and his Australian counterpart, Dutton.
33. The whole Trump thing is to just be anti left/progressive. Thats it.
34. It's even simpler. He gives them permission to say all the hateful things they d always wanted to say because they're too embittered to do a bit of introspection and realise they hate themselves.
35. that there is an example of why capital R redditors have absolutely no idea what conservative inclined people think, why would anyone respond in good faith to that? Enjoy the circle jerk lads!
36. I’m sorry, I think you’re going to have to be more specific as to who that is.
37. Insulting conservatives like that for the last decade is one of the reasons people have been pushed to people like Trump. MANY conservatives are never Trumpers.
38. How would they frame it? Btw, I’ve always been centre right. Except the right keeps going more and more extreme making me seem left.
39. How will Trump be better for the economy when he will bring in tariffs that’s will drive up prices (and inflation)? The US has post COVID inflation under control and unemployment is at record lows. Their economy is doing great (now).
40. I mean let’s say you’re right and inflation is being caused by the “war machine” and not by the many other factors. So you’re willing to let Democratic countries be invaded to reduce inflation. Does that apply to Australia too? Or just others countries you happen to live in?
41. The idea that inflation is due to the US funding Israel and Ukraine is a bit much for mine. Russia is to blame for the war in Ukraine anyway, not the USA.
42. > zero polices If your head is buried in the sand maybe. I haven't even particularly been keeping up with either campaign in the US but even I can see she has policies, some announced within the last 2 days or so with the minimum wage stuff.
43. I mean if Kamala has zero policies then what does Trump have? He's not put forward a viable or intelligent policy initiative since he entered US politics
44. I didn't think this would be a thing, but I saw a lady pretend to tap yesterday. It was the act of tapping with an empty hand that caught my attention. Had she just walked, I probably wouldn't have noticed, thinking maybe she had a paper ticket.
45. They write in the name, a box, and number it. Problem is, a name on a ballot paper other than a candidates name renders it informal. Doesn't count for anyone.
46. Yeah there's absolutely a difference between working an actual shift in fast food with the chaos and exhaustion that involves and doing a photoshoot at a closed fast food place where you're guided and coddled and everyone tells you you're the best worker they've ever had and no one cooks chips like you.
47. Or just draw a little pencil moustache over his lip
48. When I refused the 💉because I looked up what the side effects read in the vaccine insert I saved my health and probably my life. Turbo cancers and sudden heart attacks in even young people are brand new post Vax side effects. So I'll stick to what I know and what millions globally have opened their eyes to. What others choose is up to them.
49. Or maybe if you don't agree with my findings you can search for your own answers. I'm just saying .
50. Bush...behind Trump in so many ways. It all goes back to Bush. Bush's "yes people" on the Supreme Court. Bush SILENT on Trump...
51. At the same time I wear a parody maga hat “Make Aliens Greet Again” at the beach and rabid morons come up to me telling me I can’t wear that hat and I’m a fascist I greatly question these people’s intelligence and literacy
52. Hitler had a fair amount of support in the UK back then also.
53. Yes. I think there is still a slight difference between the liberals and the Nationals in an ideological sense currently, but it is fading fast. I would say that Scott Morrison or Malcolm Turnbull were still more of a Howard era style liberal compared to where Peter Dutton is leading that party now. I do think One Nation, Palmer United and KAP would join a National party led coalition, but wouldn't if the Liberals were still involved.
54. Gonna be egg on your face once fluffypipe reveals that they're actually a seppo billionaire/oil tycoon.
55. Things in Australia were cheaper while he was in office, this rise in inflation is because of the democrat war machine based on hatred. He is the first US president in 70 years that didn't start a new war. The inflation we are experiencing in Australia is directly related to how well they do, if the US does well, we will do well. It is widely reported that over 150 million people outside the US escaped poverty while he was in power. All this stuff is worth the mean tweets. The left is completely weak
56. While FEMA left the hurricane hit people of Ashville with no help(the money went to Ukriane ) Trump sent supplies and Elon set up free Starlink access for communications. Trump has personally helped many people along the way including Pro Boxer Michael Austin. Look up his story. He recently spent a day working at McDonalds and talking to all the staff while cooking and serving food. He was in a shop to buy something and he handed over $100 to a woman paying for her groceries at another till. When he was president he brought in many executive orders which are now in place to safeguard the public's safety and free speech. He flew to every country in the world when he was president and spoke with military leaders. As anyone knows the government is really run by civil servants, the actual politicians do very little and we don't need them, the military leaders serve the public. Trump spoke to them all to ensure that when devolution of government come into force the people will be protected by the military. Several places in US have kicked out their local government and changed the locks. This will continue until everyone realises we are free to make our own local community decisions. People need to use their brains and search for the answers themselves. Why do you think whistle-blowers get silenced? Why did Assange get imprisoned? Why did Snowden get exiled to Russia?
57. Yeah you're right then there's the people that should know better but refuse to vote for a democrat. There is some misogynistic aspects I think too. The US is still pretty backwards.
58. It doesn't matter though....due to their electoral college, they have much more clout and win their states. They don't even have fair representation. Montana has a Rep for every 515,000 residents. Using 1 Rep for every 515,000 residents....leaves BLUE California 20 something Reps short !
59. Trumpism completely bypasses the logical thought process. I'm not joking.
60. You just summed it up so perfectly, my god! It makes so much sense too. My older sister is a Trumpy fan, and I couldn't figure out why. But yeah, she's been going on rants about how much she thinks certain LGBTQ people are groomers/pedophiles, being rabidly anti-woke, anti-feminist, anti-vegan/environmentalists, anti-immigrants etc. I knew right-wing media was the culprit, but I never thought to sum it up like you did. She said that the left 'betrayed her' during the pandemic because she's anti-vax. So basically, she switched political sides out of spite. That's so pathetic too. Trump pisses of 'The Libs (TM)' so that means this 78 year old, dipshit, mentally ailing, narcissistic, sex offending, Russian shill, convicted felon, dictator gonna-be who's going to tank the economy and take so many people's rights away; should have the reins to a powerful country! I've never been so disappointed in people.
61. Trump is Organised Crime...therefore anyone loving Trump is into fraud and felon activities. It is why he has Libertarians supporting him. NO GOVT, no LAWS. It's all about abolishing the Rule of Law so Organised Crime and the uber rich can do what they want and the little person has no leg to stand on. He is using dumb Conservative racism and religious zealot tendencies (using trigger words to incite cult response) to get himself elected but he doesn't give a flying fock about them. It's all about Organised Crime.
62. It's this and because they want to feel part of something.
63. This....\^\^\^\^\^. They actually don't think much further than their racism, their religion and their misognyy.
64. Trump isn’t a conservative. Romney, Christie, Cheney. These are real conservative Republicans. I’m not a loony left. I was hoping Romney beat Obama. But Trump is no Romney.
65. I’m interested in what they think. You can DM me if you want.
66. It's the bloke who's also got something like 40+ felonies
67. Being a never-Trumper is a pretty low bar for basic decency. You deserve congratulations for that just as much as for, I dunno, not stealing money from a beggar on the street.
68. You sound like school teachers when the bullied kid fights back after 5 years of abuse.
69. Bollocks...Conservatives have been at Liberals for years because (in the USA) they can't get past the civil war loss. Poor darlings can't cope with Progressive thought patterns and acceptance of minorities. "Insulting conservatives" ? Don't make me laugh. How can you even go low enough to insult a Conservative...they are worthy of every factual statement about them.
70. Spoke to a one nation vollie at a polling booth the other day and she was adamant that Trump was amazing and wished they had a trump like candidate in Aus. It's the extreme social conservatism and economic protectionism that they like. In a case of a Trump presidency. They think the answer to the USA getting Trump again should be us doing our own Trump politics.
71. Exactly this. I've always been Centrist but now I'm Left ...because the Right has gone so far RIGHT. 99% of people have not changed...but the centre point has. Most of us have balanced views but now being humane is LEFTIST ?
72. I wouldn’t say their economy is doing great when they are also suffering a cost of living crisis
73. People care about jobs to feed their families. Tariffs help protect American industry (such as the car industry from Chinese BYU factories in Mexico). Unemployment is increasing and we are likely to enter a recession next year based on the layoffs which are continuing. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE/
74. Who’s invading us? No one dude… idea troops landing in our shore for a ground invasion is nonsense. Wars these days are about expensive toys which Australia has
75. I think you need to research the war in Russia a little bit more and realise why the price of fuel is the way it is … Wars absolutely equal inflation
76. Lol, l guess what Channel 9 says is so true
77. The fake tap is crazy, my move is using my MyWay and pretending to be a confused tourist
78. Yeah I’m not sure why they’d think it would work
79. Considering their actual vote is highly likely to be have been One Nation or LNP or Family First, I call that a win.
80. And everyone claps at every move you do (somewhat) correctly lol
81. OH and confirmation bias too you’re hitting all of the points!
82. No one wants to engage with you, they just don't want to be around you. Think about if you'd rather be "right" or alone.
83. some most would rather parrot the narrative of the corporate media, pacs and super pacs
84. So you were walking around with a hat styled to look like a MAGA hat, and then got upset because people thought you were wearing a MAGA hat?
85. Dutton is a MAGAt and so was Morrison. Turnbull was the last centrist standing. I think the Teals are the slight different between Libs and Nationals. They are the breakaway group from a party gone AWOL up the extremism path. The current Libs will do everything GOP is up to. Dutton harping on about nuclear...when the only countries pumping them out is China and Russia (says a lot). Not in their country either.
86. That was pre-covid where everything was cheaper worldwide 🤦 purely coincidental. It wouldn't have mattered if Mickey mouse was in office back then, prices would've been the same. "Because of the democrat war machine". Maybe a lesson in basic economics is required; explaing what causes inflation... Re-read what you wrote, it isn't making much sense.
87. Trump pulled troops out of Afghanistan and let the Taliban take over. Also, Joe Biden is not "the left", he's a centrist at best
88. "the money went to Ukraine" is absolutely not how a country's budget works lol. Some of those things are true - do any of those affect Australia in any way?
89. Are you trolling? If not, I'm astonished you know how to write (albeit badly)
90. Yay for your sister - convid was a giant SCAM.
91. Yes, he is using cultism to solidify his base...and it was easy to do. America is already a religious cult so fine tuning them was easy.
92. He's a Libertarian using Conservative drawcard and religious cult. He's also a rapist , a traitor, a fraud and a felon. Well done you...your morals are in your ass.
93. I wasn’t saying that doesn’t define Trump, I was saying that defines many US politicians -_- It was a joke.
94. You seem to have a hate filled stereotype of what conservatives are. This is the problem with labels like left/right and progressive/conservative. Each side bundles all these preconceived images upon the entire group. Try not being so filled with hate.
95. lol not all Conservatives are Confederates. You talk about facts. How about the fact that it was the Democratic Party who were actually the Confederates during the civil war. > Before the American Civil War, the party generally supported slavery or insisted it be left to the states. After the war until the 1940s, the party opposed civil rights reforms in order to retain the support of Southern white voters. and > The crisis for the Democratic Party came in the late 1850s as Democrats increasingly rejected national policies demanded by the Southern Democrats. The demands were to support slavery outside the South. and > During the Civil War, Northern Democrats divided into two factions: the War Democrats, who supported the military policies of Republican President Lincoln; and the Copperheads, who strongly opposed them. In the South party politics ended in the Confederacy. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Democratic_Party_(United_States) 🤦‍♂️
96. I don't suppose you asked her how she could support such a morally bereft, vile pig regardless of his politics? I understand that you probably wanted to get out of there.
97. It’s happening on the other side too. The hard left is becoming more and more extreme. The world needs more moderates.
98. > US Unemployment Rate is at 4.10%, compared to 4.20% last month and 3.80% last year. This is lower than the long term average of 5.69%. https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_unemployment_rate#:~:text=Basic%20Info,long%20term%20average%20of%205.69%25.
99. You do know Australia has had conscription during times of war too, right?
100. So you moral compass is “won’t happen to us to I don’t care”. Makes sense. BTW you’re dreaming if you think we can’t be invaded. It wouldn’t be a traditional invasion like Ukraine. It would be a naval blockade of shipping routes slowly bringing us to our knees. Before an eventual invasion or most likely an Australian surrender if we didn’t have US support.
101. I know that the war in Russia is absolutely spiking fuel and gas prices. My point is that the war in Russia is not Ukraine or the USA's fault and the USA should absolutely not just let Ukraine fall.
102. Y’all have fake taps? People I see who don’t tap just walk straight past it
103. There's a concept in cooker land on "vote nullification" derived from very American ideas of somehow usurping the result. Here in the free world, they're just plain old informal. As in, the votes are counted as being issued and returned without a voting intention licitly marked. Writing in "Donald Trump" isn't specifically recorded. Neither is "Mickey Mouse" or "no candidate reflects my views". The what of the informal vote isn't recorded. Just that it's informal. The idea is is enough votes are returned then the result is somehow invalid. My understanding of election law is incomplete, but, that solution is I believe not valid.
104. Assessing things based on whether they would work or not, or even *have* worked or not, is outside the scope of a Trumper.
105. I mean if you can’t read and see that it’s a hat designed to mock the maga hat that’s on you Being able to read and understand a joke requires only minimal intelligence
106. Morrison was a bit plain and had nothing really going for him apart from his religion, but I still think he was more traditional. He was just a guy who would have been far better suited as a Governor than as P.M. based on his experience. There is a reason both federal Coalition leaders come from Queensland, because traditionally it was a National's stronghold. Campbell Newman was technically a liberal pre LNP, but before that the last Liberal to win an election in Queensland was in 1911. If the Liberals stay in the coalition, they become nothing more than a brand name. If they leave, they probably will probably be able to join with the Teals up and become a strong third party independent of the Nationalist b/s.
107. Yeah it's sad.. I watched a few woman saying we can't have a woman in the white house . Woman have periods and they can start wars because they are too emotional... Imagine being a woman and misogynistic? It blows my mind. Sad state the US is in.. Maga is like Isis for white people.
108. What? Did you mean to respond to another comment? Nothing I said was in support of Trump.
109. It’s possible to look at what people do, and listen/read what they say, as a tool of assessing their character. It’s possible they could be “pretending” for some reason but frankly I don’t give a shit. Advocating for, and enacting oppression of women, racial minorities, renters, employees etc: evil. I don’t really care why they think they’re “correct” to do that and I wouldn’t believe their self-serving lies anyway. What did they *actually do*?
110. Usual Conservative retort....but so self absorbed you cannot see that it is Conservatives who hate homosexuals, trans, poor people, people who need monetary help. In fact Conservatives hate everyone...and whinge about everything.
111. Oh god..the old Democrats were the Confederates during the civil war. You know that was just a name, right ? The Republican name didn't even exist. Correct...they broke away and formed the new party leaving the 'democrats' to become Republicans who wanted their slaves. Quite like the Teals and the Liberal Party. You know others are up on history...but not cherry picked history, right ?
