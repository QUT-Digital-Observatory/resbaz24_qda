Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. To be honest as someone who owns an EV, the LNP allowing the private sector to step in and build infrastructure isn't the *worst* idea. The government built and owned 'Queensland Electric Super Highway' of EV charging stations across QLD was visionary when it was announced, but is an absolute joke these days. The chargers are old, slow and unreliable, and due to the fact that up until recently the government only charged $0.30/kWh to charge there (less than half the price of competing charging networks) it's absolutely killed private investment in infrastructure because the stations cost a fortune to install and are already unprofitable, but then are also being undercut by the government chargers when they work. As a result the government has a complete monopoly on charging especially in more regional areas which wouldn't be a huge issue usually, but each site only has a single charger which means only one car can charge at once. The chargers are also broken quite often. All of this would be forgivable if they were still rolling out new stations but the network build has also completely stalled, 'Phase 3' which included important locations like Goondiwindi and Emerald was meant to be completed ages ago but many sites just never got built or are still sitting there waiting to be switched on. The government released revised timeframes for the commissioning some of these chargers before the election and completely missed the deadlines each time, basically they've just given up on it. The government did finally have a good idea and is rolling out co-funded EV charging sites now (allowing private operators to build them and the government provides some funding to assist with grid connection etc) but the rollout has been going at a snail's pace, originally all 46 sites were meant to be built by the end of 2024 but that's quietly changed to 2025, they're opening a site every 2-3 months which is ridiculously slow. The good thing is at least you can drive from Brisbane to Cairns now and barely use the government chargers. I imagine the LNP will stop the co funding progam and let private operators go at it alone - this isn't great either but better than the government pricing private competitors out of building infrastructure altogether. I hope the co funding program stays because it's worked really well in NSW (huge difference in infrastructure when you cross the border) but we'll have to wait and see.
2. But also reflective of a likely broader policy intent to keep regions alive. LNP recognise they have a significant voter base outside of metro Brisbane.
3. Does that work out worst the longer you own the house?
4. Yes the result of this election is qlders voted to favour the regions over metro Brisbane. Whether that works out ultimately for the state is for time to tell
5. I would assume so, one off payment vs yearly payments.
6. I’ve been in the area for 16 years and seen a lot of growth in that time. Lived in the older Springfield and Springfield lakes, now living in a larger block at Camira. I don’t think there is any risk of flooding in the area honestly. I haven’t seen any. Nice area that’s getting busier. I liked living in Springfield lakes with the facilities they had there. Lakes to walk the dog around, tennis and basketball courts etc. Being close to the shopping centre was nice. Every suburb has its good and bad streets which you can usually tell after a drive through them. I love where we live currently at Camira. Nice wide streets on a 2000sqm block with lots of gum trees and nature everywhere. Still close enough to the shops and train line.
7. There is not a single home in Springfield/Lakes that isn't an eaveless concrete hot box of shit. If you "value character" prepare to be extremely disappointed.
8. If you and your imaginary kids like community sport, it's great. I play for the local soccer club there and the facilities are gobsmackingly good.
9. If you like character look into Ipswich. Just bought an older Queenslander on 809sqm. 40 min into the city on an express train, have gotten used to the commute!
10. Make sure you include hail damage in your insurance quotes.
11. In Springfield Lakes, be careful with timber retaining walls. They were all built very cheap and many have started failing over the last 5-10 years.
12. We’re in Augustine heights. Have been here for a year after moving back from overseas. Happy to answer any questions. We looked at Springfield lakes as well. We love our area, not as busy as Springfield lakes, has less of a cookie cutter feel. The public school here is excellent. Close enough to the shops. I commute from goodna station so my train runs express in mornings and afternoons. So many sports and activities for the kids. Yeah all round it’s been a great move for us.
13. Also in Camira here. Looked at Springfield lakes and hated the small blocks and hot houses. Shops there are good, lake is nice. On 800sqm block in a street in Camira , quiet , well Kept houses /streets where I am. very friendly / community conscious neighbours - I’ve got all my small streets phone numbers and know them all by name. As always a few rough houses in every suburb. Easy access to the coast and Brisbane. Almost didn’t look here because I thought it was too far away. Glad I did - I wasn’t aware it didn’t have a good reputation until reading this post. But I lived in Riverview before that for 6 years so anything is a step up!
14. It is peak American suburbia. Lacks all sorts of good urban design. That said, I moved into a new development in Bellbird Park, (a couple suburbs over) and really love it.
15. If nature is your thing, look near Wacol/Sumner. Kangaroos literally chill in your front yard and jump on through it
16. Looks like you are after character, affordability and nature. Your best bet would be a rural town. Dayboro has some beautiful character near nature and is far more affordable than the inner city but you lose the ability to commute in under an hour. Compromise is the biggest word in real estate aside from another C word which is usually reserved for real estate agents.
17. I lived in Springfield Lakes for 16 years (since 2008) and loved it. I lived in the ‘older part’ of Butterfly Green and had a huge back garden - 800sqm so you can have a bigger yard if you don’t move to the newer part. The streets were clean and safe, I’d walk my dog late at night with no trouble. There were a number of small kangaroos and deer in habitat springs. The IGA shop is great and the staff are friendly - Moey’s butcher in the same complex is brilliant. The parks are well maintained and peaceful. The area doesn’t flood - you might get some overland flow during heavy rain depending on how your drains are. Make sure you take out insurance as the storms can be wild - I made an insurance claim due to the 31 Oct 2020 hail storm which peeled back my colourbond roof and crushed the car roof. Orion is fine - usual shopping centre ferals but never had any issues. I hear the lagoon can be busy but I never went. The Ripley satellite hospital is close by and was great when I had to go there late last year. I only moved as I needed acerage and I’d recommend people to move out there if they liked the area. Note that the Greenbank Army Base is close by and during wet weather they seemed to do some of their training exercises. It used to be much more active but now you I’ll hear the occasional gun activity.
18. Have you considered forest lake? It is a slightly older suburb, but larger blocks of lands, nice parks and trees, slightly closer to the city.
19. It’s a beautiful area. Property prices are quite high in the area but look, it’s the price you pay I guess for the beauty and quality both. It’s a nice area if you haven’t already, do come and drive around a bit. White rock conservation park isn’t too far and so there are many others on not long drives away. Springfield isn’t so bad with public transportation but newer parts of redbank plains which is an equally beautiful area if not more, have sadly very limited public transportation options. Property is relatively cheaper there than buying in Springfield but as I said you pay for the beauty and convenience of living perhaps is better words than saying quality of living.
20. Ohh this is close to my home town. My family live out there still which suits them with kids and working locally. Older Springfield has some more ‘character’ homes that are cottage style otherwise a lot is new build copy and paste. I do miss the ease of having everything I need there- good infrastructure in Springfield for bike riding etc and white rock is so close. Lots of cute cafes and all the shops you need in one place really. The commute can be a bit shit, it’s being a while since I’ve lived there but the centenary motorway is a joke
21. Property prices are very high for what you actually get. Summer is awful, everyone is on top of each other, separated by huge concrete retaining walls. It's mostly investment properties being rented out these days, and some of the areas are getting a bit "rougher". (No shade, I was renting there). I may have been unfortunate in my time but we always had issues with loud parties. Also, it's a bit of a dog barking nightmare (again, living on top of eachother). They are finally developing the roads but there is still very few services and very little to do. The main shopping centre, Orion, is always packed and after one or two visits, you've seen it all. There are also very few "restaurant" options that aren't takeaways/fast food or chains. I liked it when it was cheaper. Now, no.....
22. The community is pretty good, really upgraded a lot in the last 10 years. It really depends where your work is. It's a bit of a secluded community, so sorta stuck there a lot
23. Don't they get some pretty severe storms out that way?
24. It's boring. Look up north in Kallangur, there are many scenic spots speard out to Sunshine Cost for you to explore. And 15'-20' drive to the beach.
25. Shit It's sandwiched between Ipswich and Greenbank. Fucking hot or fucking cold. Three decent weeks a year where it's not either of them. On the storms, just remember that hundreds of houses got storm damage when giant hail punched through the rooves and they got destroyed inside. I'd catch the train because the Centenary Highway is clogged every weekday. Dopey designers force both lanes into one, it's not like there wasn't enough width to include the merge if they thought of it before building it, northbound and nobody knows how to merge at speed.
26. If you like Character, close to nature, and good for familiy life, look into West Toowong or Taringa. Some really great pockets backing onto Mt Cootha reserve.
27. Thanks so much! How’s Camira to live and surrounded areas? Wouldn’t mind to explore other areas if we can get a larger block.
28. I second this. But a few minutes up the road in Augustine heights or bellbird park there are some houses with character. Close enough to Springfield lakes that you can take advantage of the outdoor spaces, but homes with character (and decent size blocks)
29. Or blocks bigger than 500m2 I’d guess. If you like nature look elsewhere, because it won’t be in your backyard.
30. Love that! I grew up playing soccer, so I love hearing there is a community there. My imaginary kid will be so happy.
31. Their budget is 750k. They’re about 1.25m short of the average house in those suburbs.
32. I really like it here. Married couple with 2 now teenage kids. We were lucky to snaffle a place during covid for a good price. The suburb had a bit of a rough reputation but I don’t really see many other than owner occupiers that are either retired or in the middle of family life. Lots of people that have been living in their place for a long time in our street. Which usually counts for something. My young fella loves to go riding around the different tracks around the place. We use the dog park all the time. The local bakery is top notch which matters lol. I’d highly recommend having a good drive around all the surrounding areas to get a feel for it. Some hidden gems around for sure.
33. In that price range? Not much really, and Springfield is closeish to some nature like White Rock. You could check out some of the older suburbs in the area like Collingwood Park and Camira, though they don't have a great reputation. Generally areas with decent nature around are going to be more expensive.
34. OP - this! Move to the inner city ring of Ipswich for character. You can get a fixer upper Queenslander in the best parts of town (Newtown, Eastern Heights, Woodend, Sadliers Crossing, Coalfalls) for your budget and make it a palace over time. Character and heritage everywhere. Way better than new concrete boxes.
35. Out of interest where did Camira get its bad rep from? This post is the first I’ve heard of it. I moved in 4 years ago and haven’t come across any issues, very friendly suburb from what I’ve experienced .
36. Thanks! We’ve heard that Ipswich has a high crime rate, and to better avoid. What’s your perspective? Would the suburbs you mentioned be a safer bet? We’re open to buying a home anywhere with an easy commute to Brisbane, as long as it isn’t a typical ‘cookie-cutter’ house and safe.
37. Grew up in Camira. It's always been a sleepy suburb, but never had a bad rep. Some of its neighbours, on the other hand.....
38. Lived here for 15 years and never had a problem or felt unsafe. Raising my kids here and it’s just like a big country town close to the city. Lots of fab people and honestly fine. Some interesting characters and some homeless in the CBD, but that’s the same as Brisbane. I had my house broken into in Highgate Hill 20 years and only time I have had my car stolen was when I lived in the city. These suburbs I mentioned are great. Go for a visit sometime and drive around. Just remember that it’s a country town and closes early - go for brunch at Rafter and Rose in the top of town on Saturday before driving around is my advice ☺️
39. And Inala and Wacol and Carole Park and a heap of other areas people don't often speak well of. I had an ex from Camira, she was awesome though, so yeah there's that.
40. Someone will try it on, either katter or a rogue super conservative LNP member. It's just a matter of when
41. Katter reconfirmed on ABC coverage last night he'd be putting a bill forward on abortion. He listed a shitload of infrastructure things he needed fixed in his electorate and STILL has time to push on the abortion bill.... It's not a low priority for him.
42. It’s crazy to consider that if LNP retained Labor’s mining royalties, it could cover the estimated $5 billion needed for Olympic upgrades and still have surplus funds left over after just one year. Many people may not fully grasp the scale of revenue being lost and the significant improvements that could have been funded with that money. For context, in the 2021–2022 financial year, Queensland received approximately $7.3 billion in mining royalties. Retaining even a portion of these funds could have substantial implications for public infrastructure and services. But the qld voters have spoken, apparently half the state would rather all that money goes to a few fat ass billionaires instead. Fuck LNP and its crooks.
43. 1) Mining royalties will be cut. 2) Schoolies drug testing and 3 strike rule will be cut. 3) Criminalising abortion will be put to a conscience vote as either KAP or an LNP member bring it to table. 4) Due to 1), LNP will falsely claim that ALP has been recklessly overspending and putting QLD into significant debt that they have to unfortunately cut a few things. These will be, Education, healthcare, 50c fares, energy rebate, rego discount. My prediction of at least the next 12 months Edit: Conscience not Consensus
44. I was young when Newman was in but now I work for Queensland health, any healthcare workers around at the time who could fill me in on the impact to your job?
45. I have lived in North Queensland all my life. I have loved my life here and hold many cherished memories. Old Bob Katter has always been a loud, uneducated asshole, but his son has taken it to a whole new level. This extremist rhetoric, and the persistence of people in these parts to continue electing him despite this, has just about sealed my decision to leave my home of 35 years. I cannot tolerate the company of people who can listen to the kind of racist, bigoted, extremist nonsense he’s spewing and still find their way to vote for him over and over again.
46. At what point does Queensland go “hey maybe we should give up on the LNP and choose another opposition to Labor?” The few times they’ve gained power in QLD they’ve royally fucked everyone over. So why do they still get a chance every so often?
47. That's the problem though isn't it, angry voters are stupid voters. A delinquent 12 year old kid born into poverty and crime stole Debbie's car, so of course Debbie is going to vote for a party who base ALL of their policies on populism and ideology.. As long as children get thrown into adult prisons!!
48. I'm very concerned about public healthcare going forward. My partner and I have referrals we've already been waiting a long time on, we're both disabled. Currently doing a program at the hospital but every time I talk to the drs they say it's already pretty dismal in the system and I hate to think how many people's conditions will worsen because the already crumbling system crumbles further. All these LNP types would be quick to tell me I'm lazy for not working, but won't acknowledge that I can't work because It takes potentially years to access the fucking health system to get better.
49. Cristafulli seems pretty unpopular already . When he starts selling the state and doing shady shit , labor will waltz back in in 2028
50. The LNP used the exact same playbook that the US Republicans did in the 1960's and have used ever since. Protests are exactly what they want. They want people talking about abortion and people getting angry about it. They want to split the working class right down the middle and make it red vs blue just like America. They want that so no one will hold them to account on all the other horrible shit they're going to do. Like kids in privatised prisons. "In a democracy they don't tell us what to think, they tell us what to think about."
51. Rip my 50c fairs to work…oh and my basic human right to healthcare and autonomy over my body. Awesome, thanks Queensland.
52. There goes Arts Funding, Ownership over our vaginas, coal royalties, free ambulances, cheap public transport, the depressing list goes on. The LNP have never been a party for the average person & they’ve never believed in climate change. I certainly wouldn’t trust them.
53. I just spoke to someone who is a boomer and said “oh, everyone just wanted Steven out”. Shits me that people vote without any understanding on policy or party ethos. I said, well you just opened the door for Dutton to have more friends in high places. Reply: “oh we hate Dutton” I’m leaving the country if he gets to be PM. We will truly have lost our way.
54. For the lnp to have reached 47 seats a lot of women and young girls posting on tik tok about going to vote for them. I worry for Queenslanders as the Morrison gov created this economic crises. Most families struggling. The only relief was from the state as the fed stopped us from a recession that every other country has faced. Now the lnp will cease coal companies paying Queenslanders for our minerals, start cutting everything and blame the former gov. Rego up, taxes up, rates up, petrol prices will jump straight away with out the threat of a gov owned petrol station. Rail gone, cheap public transport. All measures to help will be gone. At least sky news will still make them feel good about them selves and blame the fed gov for their problems.
55. Goddam. I need to unplug from the news for a bit. It's so depressing. Who are these people that think this was in any way a good idea? Blows my mind.
56. Let’s see if there is going to be a real improvement to people outside the South East corner or whether or not they learned from last time. Personally I see a repeat of history because unfortunately the pollies are right about I thing: voters are stupid no matter which side their sit on.
57. As a Labor Party member, I can assure you, we are going to be absolutely merciless in holding the LNP to account over the next four years.
58. Qlder's can look forward to their tax $$ going to consultancy firms. Who will take over the role of the public service, which will be gutted. Its going to be horrible to watch religious views, take a front seat in QLD politics.
59. How the f*** do we live in a country where Queensland just voted to lock up little children instead of giving them free school lunch? Just wow
60. You know what, bring on the anti-abortion vote. Let people find out what happens when they vote for a super dodgy corrupt morally regressive religious nutcase party into power. The people fucked around, and the people are gonna find out (fyi that I am pro abortion, but it seems stupid people are only learn through personal suffering)
61. A tale as old as time. >LNP: NOOooo No nOooOOoo mate, vote for us we won't do any of that. >Also LNP: Right, we're in? Fuck yes. All of that is now on the table. Heh, fuckin heh. Enjoy it while it lasts people, remember the psychic damage in four years when the next election rolls around.
62. I think a congratulations are in order. I would like to congratulate the News Corp media and 7 West Media for winning the election. Not that 2 oil men who have billions in shares in fossil fuels would want to sway the election. /s I look forward to no more abortions. Teenage mothers on the street with no where to live 8 year olds in an adult prison (that's going to work out well). Removing the gas royalties (So they get the gas for free again) And a state debt not in dollars borrowed but in stuff that needs to be done but isn't costing you all money. Higher energy bills over time (they love gas. You should buy more of their gas, actually you won't have a choice) Enjoy the new Toll road with its taxpayer funding but almost entirely Transurban owned. They will build it for certain. Housing defaults up Stuff being closed and shut down everywhere. The psychopaths are back in power. Well done!
63. The difficulty with the issue is that we basically live in a dictatorship in Florida. What I mean by this is that the state is notionally conservative (55/45) as we can tell by the federal stranglehold on the state and becoming more conservative with people migrating north from NSW and Victoria and when you give a government that much power with no upper house and 4 year terms (where as discussed last night they can call on issues like preferential voting with less than 20 mins notice to vote) you are going to get outcomes that have not been properly debated and rushed through simply because they have the majority and there is no other check and balance. With the abortion issue Labor have done well enough anyway for it to survive a conscience vote and it was a reality check for KAP where it is likely to lose a seat not to overstep the mark because they have been pushed to the extremes of conservative politics with how they have been excised (rightly in my view) from the LNP
64. Sad to say that what I'm most upset about us is that we will lose our 50c fares in March. That $200 a month was pretty bloody handy. Other than that none of the parties are worth anything really.
