Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. I didn’t vote for LNP because they didn’t come out and back the Vic Park proposal. So I donkey voted and let the good people of QLD decide.
2. Well yes, Miles himself rejected the central finding in the independant review his government commissioned. He could have given the green tick on Vic Park but he chose not to. Also, I don’t have kids so free lunches in primary schools has zero impact on my life and frankly this policy was a desperate attempt to win votes from Labor. The previous government had been in power for nearly 10 years.. and they only release this policy on the eve of the election they know they’re gonna lose? Give me a break
3. Yeah fuck all those plebs who need public hospitals. Fuck chronic illness and cancer patients too - researchers trying to find cures aren’t entitled to a job! /s
4. The job position and description was not an entitlement. We are talking about the need for these services. Not the need to give someone a nice job. Anyway. Yep. Private sector is the go. The government is going to employ contractors now. Just like every time. Simple. Cost more. Can get a mates company to manage it for massive profit. And keeps the expenses off certain columns in the books. Contracting will make a lot of money. Liberal. Supreme financial managers.
5. hoping they don’t, but cursfuckwit has said the health care budget will be cut
6. Depends on the who. The management tiers are bloated as F. 'Healthcare workers' makes people think its just nurses and doctors but there are a LOT of leadership roles that slow down change/improvement and eat budget.
7. i wanted to start studying for healthcare but now i honestly don’t want too. i’m so scared that once i start there won’t even be a job
8. Surely not. I mean it’s probably not part of their plan to fix ramping and the hospitals by ditching another 10 thousand workers is it?
9. That is pretty much what screwed over Newman, so if he does it I would be surprised. But if he does, then it just shows how much of a dumb fucker he is.
10. I say 14,000 is a good number to let go . Hospitals here are a fucking joke. Privatize them and watch efficiency skyrocket.
11. If they do sack teachers, the school down the road will snap them up in a heartbeat. Same with doctors and nurses. These professions are not the people in the firing line.
12. To me public service contractors sounds more like those third party/ temp contractors call centres who take calls for Centrelink/ medicare, or temp procurement workers..because if it is, that is a cost cut i agree with. Hiring temp workers paying them pretty damn good money and then charging the government double or triple just doesn't sit right with me. Or am I not seeing the whole picture?
13. I thought government IT was already in the stone age. Feels like it some days
14.

15. Sure it’s why he won the election … because decades old alp voters thought he had good vibes.
16. I voted labor too, but I wanna try and comprehend Liberal voters, since I think it goes a bit better than just being angry all the time.
17. Currently our "sex offender registry" acts by notifying the community if the conviction is for something along the lines of child abuse. It will be along the lines of "a convicted sex offender is loving in the local neighborhood" unless the individual consents to the confidentiality agreement in which case more specific info can be shared. Offenders are monitored and are required to check in to local cop shops regularly. Imo it's a much better system than the name and shame list that makes no distinction between things like public urination and child abuse. A list is only gonna make people targets and further endanger lives with no regard. All this info is easily found online with a Google search.
18. I have no problem with providing mental health care to children, or anyone. I don't know how you managed to mangle puberty blockers with mental health care. I don't know if you've been through puberty, but it's not optional, and it is when you really figure out your gender.
19. > what peer reviewed studies have concluded does This isn't true. The is actually a *lack* of high quality studies that demonstrate that puberty blockers, hormones or sexual reassignment surgery provide benefits to children. From the [Cass Report](https://cass.independent-review.uk/home/publications/final-report/): > While a considerable amount of research has been published in this field, systematic evidence reviews demonstrated the poor quality of the published studies, meaning there is **not a reliable evidence base** upon which to make clinical decisions, or for children and their families to make informed choices.
20. Voters pushing back against the left shows that it does matter what people think.
21. So that's where the coolaid went. You drank it all!
22. There is life long damage from puberty blockers, please don't think there is none. [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9578106/#:\~:text=Results%20consistently%20indicate%20a%20negative,boys%20for%20compromised%20bone%20health](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9578106/#:~:text=Results%20consistently%20indicate%20a%20negative,boys%20for%20compromised%20bone%20health)
23. You fuck with hormones at your own peril, or stupid parents do so at the peril of their children. Puberty is hard, but humanity managed to cope with it, untill about 10yrs ago. And read up on the damage puberty blockers do.
24. Could not be further from the truth re being “interested in public education.” It’s a stupidly complicated area of policy, co-funded with the Feds who impose their own demands, and it rivals Health in terms of budget.
25. The closed borders saved many more people's loved ones. Being upset about people being kept safe from a deadly virus is unreasonable.
26. I live in the next Suburb know the area well.👌🏻
27. Cheers. From checking that out, the two possible options they have listed for elimbah, the eastern most one seems mildly acceptable. But overall, that's just such a shit route for a highway, it's so close to the bruce highway already, it would have to go either under or over the rail line and it if goes between the rail line and the highway (which is the east) it will have the least impact on housing, but i mean. Old Caboolture Road there is super fucked, in order to convert that, they'd have to buy out a bunch of properties that live along there, and the grand plan is what? Let north brisbane folks get to the glasshouse mountains a little bit quicker? I practically lived on that highway for years going to and from work, that stretch from cabo to glasshouse was always the sweetest and easiest path. It was the gateway bridge to cabo that sucked ass.
28. I'm just reminding people it's not the end of the world Jesus. Does the idea of a registery scare you? Edit:Nevermind just saw you're a vegan
29. You and I are in agreement here 100%. It needs to be part of the mix. I’m not suggesting 100% nuclear but a decent minority chunk (15-30%). If only the LNP had not been so shortsighted in the 90s to do a deal with the greens to renew ANSTO. Who knows where we could’ve been with nuclear, especially considering that climate change was becoming a topic of policy discussion towards the end of Howard’s term.
30. So the document that showed that LNP had the least amount of material support and plans to look after Education, that's your evidence that voting for LNP was a good choice? Like this document doesn't show any actual policy or how they plan to achieve any of the things they vaguely offered support towards.
31. except I did, and 30 minutes before you posted this. Guess reading a document was too much for you. So I will break down the parts I like. sending students off to tafe instead of keeping them at school. Bringing back other disciplining options, so maybe Johnny who every lesson pours water on other students books, and jumps out the window to go jump into the class next door might actually get dealt with. bringing back meaning to assessment so I'm not passing students who managed to just write down what I had on the board. Maybe our naplan and A-C data might match again. How can we have 90% A-C, but then 40% 2 years below grade level in naplan. oh and no tolerance on violence, so When a kid takes a swing at you they get more than a 2 day holiday.
32. Nothing you’ve said contradicts. I believe that the majority of Australians vote with there feelings not with facts. You just said it your self, they aren’t voting with any sort of historical considerations or evidence and most don’t have any awareness beyond what ever single issue puts them for or against one party or another. It’s not values based voting at all and it’s super easy to manipulate. Which is why the election wasn’t decided by expert policy and research, but was instead determined by media coverage and slogans. QLD is a historically labour leaning state and the shift to LNP has usually been a punishment of labour not an endorsement of LNP policy. It’s usually followed by instant regret and then a fast switch back to labour. I am very much a values driven voter. I actually very much care about which party has the most progressive policies and am a “lefty” and a socialist. It very much bothers me that we have voted out a government making very progressive policies reality for a half baked policy platform from a party with a demonstrated history of being in the pocket of big business and whose campaign was financed by mining interests. And why? Because some queenslanders don’t understand how much worse it could have been under the LNP during this cost of living crisis. So yeah it annoys me when people who say “all political parties are the same and left and right don’t matter” don’t value the important role that choosing the better of the two parties matters. It’s very unlikely that the LNP see this as their chance to prove themselves good administrators for the people of QLD… they know they’ve got 1 term to ram through as many changes as they can and set up as much benefit for their mates as possible and pad out there position before they get fucked off in the next election when it swings back to labour.
33. Almost all of those little shitcunts were born to poverty-stricken parents who didn’t want them and abused them. It makes sense that people voted for the guys who’ll ban abortion, causing more unwanted “little shitcunts” and vow to lock up all the poor kids so you never have to look at the consequences of your own actions.
34. I know a single parent whose rent skyrocketed to $1000/fortnight and they get a total of $1200 a fortnight from Centrelink. So that leaves $200 a fortnight for all other expenses. She has two jobs, both of which require childcare to get to. So the moment that a child is sick, there’s no way to get to work. The father is also digging his heels in and refusing to pay child support. And yes, she’s applied for other jobs, most of which don’t want a single parent because jobs still don’t like parents, let alone single parents. Even 20 years ago when I was a kid, before the cost of everything was fucked, the expectation was that parents/older kids would skip meals so the younger ones could eat. So yeah, I’m more than happy for my tax dollars to go towards feeding public school kids than subsidising rich wankers at Marist college to get another pool.
35. This comment shows a lack of empathy to be honest. It's shortsighted to say that all those parents are crap like that. Sure you have a small subset of people who spend it on drinks and smokes etc. but you also have people who genuinely have to choose between food for themselves and paying rent. I grew up in a town which had some real poverty and it's not always down to "alcohol and smokes". Even if their parents are spending it all on drinking and smoking do those kids deserve to go hungry? It all comes back to caring for all members of a society, children can't exactly go and get a job and buy their own lunches in these cases.
36. Can't tell if you're serious. 2 billion to feed kids is really not much compared to the other bullshit we spend money on.
37. Say it with me now. Hungry. Children. If we let kids go hungry they are far more.likelynto drop out, commit crimes and get up to general mischief, I would argue it's 2 billion well spent. Feeding kids leads to better outcomes for society as a whole. Also helps knock the (already falling) youth crime numbers lower, because kids are more likely to stay in school. With the average youth in a detention facility costing the state approx 760k per year, we are currently spending almost 300 million each year for youth lockup. Cutting this, plus feeding kids and limiting future offenders sounds like a great deal for $2b.
38. Are you aware of how much money the government spends on Defence? Over $50 billion dollars p/y last time I checked. Over 25 times what they were proposing to spend on feeding children. Don’t pretend to care about how much stuff costs if you have no problem with over 50 billion dollars going towards weapons etc. but are up in arms about school children getting a meal.
39. i assume you mean lnp have the numbers to stop it from going further
40. Yes, but LNP MPs have overwhelmingly voted against abortion access/decriminalisation and right now there is no guarantee they won't do it again.
41. That's fair on the housing front, but not like LNP would be a better option there.
42. enjoy the "melt down" I hope you got your jollies mate
43. They seemed to be doing just fine by most metrics, all we have to do is see if the LNP does better without resorting to their usual tactic - sell everything that isn't nailed down.
44. > Fkn helllll. So yous had a good gov that took responsibility and that wasn’t good enough? Basically, they weren't fantastic by any measure but they were at least making progress and working on making positive changes, we decided to burn it all down because we were bored or some sort of inane reason. > The abortion bill etc seems to be a hot topic atm, what else are they tryna pass? They plan to scrap the recently added mining royalties which were funding a decent amount of our programs, they've plans to absolutely gut the Healthcare sector, similar with the Education, everything else is all up in the air as they went to the election with sweet fuck all as actual policy beyond "kids are totally doing all the crime and we're the only ones who can stop it!". But given the LNP bullshit we've always dealt with they'll likely say fuck off to the lunches for school kids program, they'll scrap the 50c public transport program, they'll push forward on the abortion issue as well as trans related health care, they'll gut near every industry they can and push even more towards privatisation, etc... > I’m actually moving to Australia on Tuesday, arriving Wednesday lol (only whv tho so shouldn’t impact me much) I hope the flight isn't too much of a hassle, it's a long'un :)
45. Fair, there's a section of their voter base that has invested into new projects. But there's also a section that only has the one property, that section benefits from no new builds.
46. > 250k jobs flipping lollipops If you honestly believed this to be true, why are you not doing it?
47. If the example is traffic controllers getting 250k a year... Then that's not the best example to prove you point. Because it's totally made up. However, from.your example. it sounds like the issue is to much work on, and in demand workers can pick and choose the best paid work... Don't know the answer to that.. more migration?
48. One of the few places in the Australian economy where unskilled workers can still make good pay is in the construction industry.. and construction is hard work, it's risky, it can be dangerous. Workers take no risk? Jumping from project to project, companies disappearing and reapearing under a different name... Contacting companies are all like a house of cards. I am not really sure what you suggest, should workers just work harder, overtime free, weekend for no extra pay? For what it's worth, I think it's the high value of land that is ultimately poisonous for Australia, too many aspiring land bankers who don't want to work.
49. People are free to post LNP positive stuff. Instead, they'd rather complain that it's an echochamber but never do anything to change that. If you're worried about downvotes or ridicule on the internet, the internet probably isn't the place for you. People are genuinely asking the question about why people vote LNP and no one is answering, they just say it's an echochamber and that's it.
50. Well it'd be a nice change to the combative and childish "I'm bathing in leftist tears" comments I've seen today. I think it's a great question and would love to see nuanced answers.
51. You are saying your drivel is a "stupid prize"? 🥴 You're not very good at this.
52. Well it would seem a lot of people need a reminder that the 50’s weren’t the “good old days” they seem to remember…
53. So, don't fix the problem, just hide them in adult jails.
54. You're right, we DO need a development program for really scary grown up criminals!
55. I think there are like 6 people still active on Facebook, if you discount the bots and boomers. It's a hive of generative AI content and villainy.
56. ??? There was a parliamentary vote on gay marriage I think in 2012? Labor had a conscience vote on it but it failed because the liberals and nationals voted no as a block. Also in 2017 when we finally did pass it (after the liberals made us have a public debate on the issue!), more Labor MPs voted yes to it than coalition ones.
57. Agree. I went to both catholic and public schools in QLD in the 90s/00s and cannot for the life of me recall ever been taught anything about politics.
58. I haven’t seen that philosophy exhibited much in politics and certainly not in the LNP campaign going to this election. At least Miles gave it a try but I think he just didn’t have any cut though in with mainstream media.
59. Pretty tough to put that in place without it becoming insanely politicised to the point of being more trouble than to begin with.
60. I mean, I get your point, but I'd even take issue with the core concept; How much of what we hear fits the exact media playbook I mentioned earlier of repetitive familiarisation advertising and smear campaigns? I've never been to check, but I have also never been bombed into submission so I don't know if that is the natural response.
61. Youth crime certainly is an issue; the [stats](https://www.qgso.qld.gov.au/statistics/theme/crime-justice/crime-justice-statistics/recorded-crime) speak for themselves. If you don’t want to read the stats ask the next copper you meet on the street how bad youth crime actually is.
62. Isn't labor the party that said that a virus was going to "hunt you down and find you"? Im sure any arkansas inbred could cut through that argument pretty quickly. What were we left with? A state full of virus fearing deadbeat green leftists, who feel its their duty to mandate what people inject themselves with. The economic impact of covid and the soft on crime approach didnt resonate with the population and they have been booted as a result. I was locked up longer than someone who decides to rob a house because i dared to cross a border.
63. Plus, people who vote for a party because that's what their parents did aren't exactly engaged and would probably not bother.
64. If you take away compulsory voting then it will be even more weaponized who gets to vote. The US looks way worse than us. The best approach is education. I’m disappointed in this result, but I’d push for less media and less money in politics before I push for limiting who can vote.
65. By the same token we could have licences to make sure only people who are fit to be parents are allowed to breed. Sure there’s a lot of arguments that can be made in favour of these things but it’s hugely fraught with ethical problems and furthermore you can’t pretend to be operating a democratic system of government once these sorts of measures are implemented. Just about every election calls to mind the Winston Churchill quote “democracy is the worst form of government – except for all the others that have been tried.”
66. The greatest issues with non compulsory voting are that campaigns have to focus on encouraging people to vote rather than promoting the reasons why to vote for them. It also opens the door for voter suppression. As the US is a great example of, non compulsory voting doesn’t stop idiots and lunatics from voting, in fact it may encourage them to by pandering to greater extremes. Having to cast a vote, under compulsory voting, isn’t the same as having to cast a legitimate vote. There is an option for people to protest or refrain whilst still showing up. I would probably like there to be an option of “unsure” at the top of the ballot to encourage people who have no clue to not make decisions for the rest of us. In terms of the how to vote card, that is strictly for parties to work out their own preference deals. You don’t have to follow it but it does help in estimating who’s going to win the two party preferred based on first preferences
67. Okay… but the LNP are their preferred party. QLD just voted in the party that was paid the most money by those few people with all the money that cause the most issues. So if you’re wondering why we can’t have nice things that’s your answer.
68. > So why can’t we have a cleaner inner city Because we're talking about literal human beings and not rubbish you utter weirdo.
69. I don't even know how to respond to this, is this sarcasm? And like, why? Why can't we just have a reasonable discussion about why people vote the way they do and maybe learn something instead of whatever this is?
70. I find it very presumptuous to assume that because they are politically lazy, they don't care about my life or difficulties. I love my family and have been incredibly supportive all through my life. We voted on different policy, we don't have to wish suffering upon each other. I made my original comment on this post to help give some insight into the LNP voters that are in my life. They are very normal people, they have jobs, study to do and other priorities. I believe that more people should be politically conscious and I've tried to encourage that in my family without picking a fight. But, with all that said, I've just had someone publicly state online that they wish that my family suffers. That surely crosses a line. I'm asking you directly now, do you honestly believe that it's acceptable to publicly wish suffering upon someone. I think that is completely fucked up.
71. If you think they have to much influence wait till you hear about the minerals council the IPA and the business council.
72. Yes, how dare the working class push back against huge construction companies about things like safety…
73. You say this as if the bosses don't have a singular power to end a strike in an instant. Even union leaders are at the mercy of their members. The whole reason a strike occurs is because all other avenues to negotiate have failed. Where is the same smoke for the greedy bosses?
74. This is a wild take, you know unions are in most industries and rarely ever do any of those things but is generally a last resort?
75. Don’t look into the media or mining then! Let’s hope you are as passionate and voting aligns with that more so.
76. From what you understand? Suggest you actually look at the data which shows disputes are historically low.
77. Only one branch did that? All other branches have been affected though. Staff have been let go and banned from entering the industry for up to 5 years. With no proof btw.
78. Not this time, Labor really turned and did a number on us. Probably why their donations were down as well. No union would’ve given them any donations this time, well maybe the AWU.
79. So they voted green ?! I know Max from Green pop in the protest and I was shocked that lefties stand together with those gangs……
