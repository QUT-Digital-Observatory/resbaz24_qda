Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. Yes it will. He broke the promise of quitting if youth crime doesn't go down before the election even finished. If you want an idea of what to expect, look at Campell Newman and what the LNP did back then. If you are struggling now, it is only going to get worse as we lose public services to pay for tax cuts to the rich.
2. They will keep it until theyve destroyed the budget with privatisation and benefits for their mates at which point they'll blame Labor for a budget mess and fuck the taxpayers with cuts to services. This will be first to go. Alternatively, they'll sell off the contract to their mates for an absolute song and pennies on the dollar (because the fares are only 50c which devalues the rev line) and then the privatisation will lead to jacking the prices up beyond what they used to be.
3. Nope. They‚Äôll keep it for the original 6 month trial at best. Which should end in Feb.
4. They said they would match 50c fares. Then it was ‚Äúwe will keep it for the first term‚Äù, except - they never said what term. So I reckon it means ‚Äúthey‚Äôll keep it for the remaining term of the trial‚Äù which is like‚Ä¶ only a few months more of the original 6 months. 5th of August to 5th of Feb.
5. It's a Labor policy. There's no chance that LNP will accept that it's good policy... Better fiscal manager yada yada something something or whatever....
6. Nope. Transurban are losing too many "future profits" and will ask the LNP to scrap it. The LNP don't have the spine to say no.
7. One of the talking points against ALP in my circles from LNP voters is that the 50 cents fair could of been free if the ALP turned off the go cards. Now to throw around that rhetoric and not factor in that the usage data is linked to tickets and go cards which will help provide the direction for the future was a bit silly to me. The key point of the trial was to see how the public would change their habits which I have interpreted as catch as much PT as I can to see real significant change in the PT network. The investigations have to happen, our economy can't afford to pay to sit in traffic.
8. Your lefty fear-mongering friends are wrong. They have already said they will keep it. [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-15/qld-50-cent-public-transport-fares-trial-extended-permanent/104353220](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-15/qld-50-cent-public-transport-fares-trial-extended-permanent/104353220)
9. I‚Äôm pretty sure they said it would stay for 4 years
10. They promised they'd keep it but I give it 6 months.
11. My guess is no. The LNP are scrapping the mining royalties as well as numerous other taxes like GP payroll tax. I'm not sure how Crisafulli is planning to pay for any of his promises given QLD will be billions of dollars poorer under him ü§∑
12. Libs will weasel out of it, send them money to rich miners instead.
13. LNP masters will want what they paid for and the resources rent tax will be removed. Without it the 50cents have no funding LNP will claim Labor couldn't afford it and it has to stop. No more cost of living relief with power bills either. It only gets worse from here.
14. Nope. Once they cut the mining royalties the 50 cent fares will go with them.
15. If they keep it, cool. If they don't, it'll be an unpopular move because not only can Labor go to the next election promising to restore it, Labor can run the line that the traffic congestion is because the 50c fares were abolished. Labor knew this when they introduced it. It's a trap, in the same way that Morrison did with AUKUS.
16. I will be destroyed if 50c fares on public transport are scrapped.
17. They said they would continue so they should but then this is politics so‚Ä¶.
18. The LNP said they'll keep it but I'm pretty sure that's a blatant lie. They're likely to cut the coal royalties that fund it, and they've been pretty shifty about how they're going to fund anything (which probably means they actually plan to make huge cuts to public services). Newman 2.0. Hope I'm wrong though.
19. I‚Äôd love to see how much trade has increased in the CBD and West End etc since the fares were set, I bet it‚Äôs a net positive
20. It should just be free. It would get rid of the need for cards, the payment infrastructure, paying partners like news agents, the need for inspectors, card readers, service for the infrastructure and the web site.
21. The LNP have commited to 50 cent fares until the end of there 1st term If they actually stick to that promise, we will have to wait and see
22. I live on the GC but my solicitor is in Brisbane CBD. I‚Äôve had to make multiple trips up in the last few weeks, & it‚Äôs been sooooo wonderful to a) only pay 50c, & b) not have to drive & pay for parking. It‚Äôs been fantastic. I truly hope Crisafullashit keeps it in place. I did not vote for him. But if he keeps this promise I might respect him more.
23. Cynical me says it was always going back to normal at the end of the trial no matter who won. Labor tried to use it to simply buy votes and LNP will view it as an unsustainable.
24. Hasn't really done much since 'in da club' but who knows he might give it another crack
25. I imagine it will be phased out or not renewed at the end of the trial period.
26. Well if they are, it would be one of the few times a political party kept its promise.
27. From $12 return a day to the city to $1 return a day, with free rail parking has been bliss. I‚Äôll be fuming if they take it away. With grocery and rent prices so high, it‚Äôs been a small relief
28. They'll continue for a while. Then they'll quietly scrap them in the next budget.
29. They are giving $4 billion per year back to the mining companies so it‚Äôs going to be hard to keep funding anything nice.
30. Hahahahhahaha nothings gonna be kept. Im looking forward to paying 1500 bucks for a 20 minute ambulance ride fuck the LNP
31. Recognising that this is a Brisbane sub, but the 50c fares are only a winner for people with access to public transport. I am a big supporter of affordable public transport: we should have more routes and low fares. But here in Toowoomba the busses are slower than walking (according to my Google Maps searches when the 50c fare thing began) so the impact up here has been minimal. I fear that the LNP will be able to stick to the 50c fares for a long period, but cut services so "save money". Big quote marks around that last part because public transport is an investment that reduces spending on roads and healthcare.
32. this popped up on my feed and for a second i thought you were talking about the rapper 50 cent
33. Nope. They will scrap it once the trial ends citing ‚Äúa shit budget‚Äù
34. I think it will be kept. The election was far closer than anyone thought it would be, and Crisafulli would want to be on a far stronger majority than he currently is in order to be the Grinch Who Stole 50c Fares.
35. I think given the popularity of this, especially in some of the outer Brisbane, Gold and Sunshine Coast areas where big savings are at stake for commuters, they won‚Äôt get rid of the cheaper fares. They may not ideologically agree with the policy but will keep it out of self preservation.
36. They can at least wait until after new year or Easter, give folks a chance to save $50-90 a week, catch up on bills or spend it on another priority. Also a great RTO incentive (would prefer an office or view window and less Teams racket) Transport is increasingly becoming subsidised in many countries and cities around the world [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_public_transport)
37. Is Curtis Jackson in the transport industry now? What doesn‚Äôt he do?
38. Sure they'll cut some other services somewhere to pay for it. Probably in regional areas so Brisbane people don't notice.
39. I think they will keep them. The LNP would be able to spin it to the mining companies as a long term investment in the LNP maintaining power more than it being a hindrance or of public benefit. IIRC, Townsville wants a light rail as well, and they are in the review stages of the process now. So that's another potential reason for them to keep them if that gets built.
40. If there‚Äôs enough money left over once Crisafuckli has given it all to fossil fuel companies, we might have a chance.
41. They promised they'd keep it a term. I think the numbers would be pretty irrefutable from a purely money saving (and we know that's what the LNP love) standpoint, even without considering the long term social and mental health savings - less money spent on catching fare evaders, more people into the CBD (what they've been crowing about for years), less money cleaning up after car crashes, less money spent on fixing roads due to less cars etc etc etc
42. Lots of unions want it to be kept and not to mention the LNP said they'll keep it permanently too. If it gets axed a huge uproar will happen and will be forced to keep the 50 cent fares unless they lower it to 25 cents.
43. I really hope they continue the 50 cent fares. It's been such a game changer for so many, making public transport so much more accessible
44. I hope so. We have been going into the city and surrounding areas more.
45. It's simple, if they take away 50c fares everyone will go back the old method, free fares. It's better to get 50c from everyone than nothing from most people.
46. I think LNP voters will like this as much as anyone else. I mean while you drive your Monopoly Man car to work, wouldn't you rather all the poors on the train or crammed into buses?
47. He will get rid of 50c fares electricity rebate etc etc but mining companies will get all there taxes decreased - I can‚Äôt believe Qlders fell for his BS
48. They promised to keep it. But they also promised to scrap the minerals taxes that pay for it. So don't count me as confident. The reality is they will likely prioritise repealing the minerals taxes and then just claim that they really wanted to keep the 50 cent fares but they just can't afford it. Rememeber their voters are largely regional and don't get to benefit as much from the fares as those in the SE. They will only pay a minor penalty electorally if they get rid of them.
49. Doesn't it effectively put the roaming fare checkers out of the job though? Not much point checking for 50 cent fares. May as well make it FREE.
50. LNP committed to the first term at least but it's not like they haven't gone back on promises before so the only thing we can do is wait and see. With Crisafulli seeming to want a 2nd term after four years, I don't see them doing anything too crazy in their first term.
51. My prediction; Gov will drop royalties, maybe packaged with a small increase to Gas royalties for political expedience. They'll then blame Labor for budget miss management and repeal everything but the electricity subsidy, and use it as an excuse to cut the public sector. We will boot them out in 4, 8 if they kick the slashing out a term, and do the same cycle again.
52. I'm more interested how is its going to remain viable. if it can be viable then perhaps other states could look at this. TBH I don't think its viable especially over the long term of maintenance costs, otherwise it would have to come out of the pocket of something else.
53. Greatest thing the qld government have done in recent time that actually affects me in a positive way.
54. Maybe but we can guarantee we are never seeing any other cost of living relief
55. Probably not - they will have a review (with pre-determined outcomes) and then use the findings to change whatever they want.
56. I can't imagine them choosing to get rid of 50c fares. While it doesn't matter much to their regional seats, it matters a huge amount to many of their SEQ seats. It would be hard to win back all their Gold Coast seats for instance if they were the party that made traveling to work $100 more expensive each week. Even losing 2 Gold Coast seats is all they need to be potentially looking at a hung government at the next election... so it stands to reason they will want to avoid that political poison. What it sounds like they will do is try to take a "make the regions appreciate the 50c fares" approach. What form this will come in, I'm not too sure, but my guess would be that it involves instructing Translink to purchase more bus companies operating in the regions and running more buses there. If they manage to get the rail built all the way to Maroochydore and implement the busway plan there that will also get the Sunshine Coast hooked on 50c fares over time.
57. They'll use "fiscally responsible choices" to cut everything the mining tax paid for. Promises made, promises dropped.
58. i think it‚Äôll stick around until next august, then they‚Äôll pull them and say the budget has to go elsewhere (mining, most likely)
59. it was only a temp thing to get votes so no
60. I think they'll keep their promise on this one. It's such an easy vote winner and their plan is to win a second term by matching Labor on all of their policies, including health.
61. Nope. With the change of government, their vested interests in the Queensland Resources Council, that party's policies and past decisions, With natural resource royalties likely about to be cut that funds this initiative, I fully expect to be paying $6 one way again.
62. Of course they‚Äôll scrap it. Then they‚Äôll double the original fairs to get the money back. It‚Äôs LNP. Anyway they can screw over the working class.
63. It would certainly be a pretty stupid move politically to get rid of the policy. But so was sacking half the public service, and that‚Äôs what Newman did. Don‚Äôt underestimate the stupidity of the QLD LNP. They didn‚Äôt get in by being politically shrewd. They know how to play the ‚Äòtough on crime‚Äô card and not much else, to be honest.
64. No. I think it will go as will the 20% off rego and $1000 off electricity bill. üí∏
65. I can‚Äôt write it off. The Vic Liberals proposed $2 PT fares full price and $1 for concession as an election pitch in 2022. They were laughed out of the room by Vic Labor. To be fair, their campaign was piss poor. Regardless, it‚Äôs not an exclusively left or right idea. I‚Äôd hope they keep it.
66. Unpopular opinion here but my view is that fares could be higher than $0.50‚Ä¶(I.e. $2 flat for adults and $1 for concession) but still lower than the old model. Let‚Äôs be fare, most people could afford the public transport at full rates which was still pretty cheap (and heavily subsidised by tax/rate payers), and perhaps $0.50 was just a nice number. It‚Äôs an economics question about what drives more people to choose public and active transport vs driving, parking etc and the corresponding need for more roads. Not to mention the lost productivity from commuting to work in traffic. Whatever the optimal revenue/patronage model comes out as, funding will be needed to build additional transit infrastructure and enhancements, turning the flywheel to make public transport better and more widely used‚Ä¶. Increasing patronage revenues and reducing the need for more and more (soon to be congested roads) Not sure which level of government or political party will master it, however Brisbane and Australia at large, needs steady, consistent and targeted funding for public transport infrastructure into every major city over many many years to come
67. Probably not after 12 months but I don't expect it to go back to where it was. $2 fares is what they will settle on as a compromise between budget position, cost of living and bringing more business into the CBD
68. Hopefully but also hope they put on more services to cope with the extra demand on some routes (like mine that never shows up anymore) but that'd be too much to ask right!!
69. I hope so. It‚Äôs one of the best government initiatives I‚Äôve seen for a long time.. actually that I can remember. Benefits the wider community, gets cars off the road, promotes use of public transport, saves money for those that need it most
70. I‚Äôm sorry you have to ask this. It‚Äôs absolutely going. They‚Äôre saying it won‚Äôt. But it‚Äôs going.
71. The LNP aren't exactly known for having the integrity to stick with a promise. It'll be scraped the moment they need to funnel money citing "Queensland can't afford this, because mining corporations need the extra skim off the top"
72. While I‚Äôm all for 50c fares staying (albeit it is a bit hard on our regional constituents who don‚Äôt have access to it) you do all realise that Labor was in power for over a decade with the power to do this and only enacted this policy six months before an election they were expecting a bloodbath in? It was all just a political vote grab.
73. LNP never looked after anyone not wealthy. It'll be scrapped.
74. I doubt it just an election gimmick to get power.you wat h oh we looked at the budget unfortunately we can't sustain the loss for sure
75. Nope, the elections are over. You don‚Äôt need to be bribed any more. As you were, ~~soldier~~ citizen.
76. Everyone talking about 50c fares like they are life changing but then they go out and spend $6 on a coffee like it's nothing lol.
77. Cheaper tolls would help our family I get free train fares anyways..
78. I think it‚Äôs good policy - however it did nothing for the people of regional Queensland‚Ä¶ remember this is where LNP won the election and sent a clear message to ALP‚Ä¶ so time will tell
79. Will the coal royalties still be paying for it noting the donors that helped the LNP?
80. Look we just don‚Äôt have the train infrastructure and I voted ALP. It was stupid to be honest. Buses, well I can only say for sunny coast, but trains? Are you kidding? We never had enough trains running often enough to compete with peak traffic in and out of the CBD but not it‚Äôs a shit-fight
81. If they take it away I‚Äôm going to find another country to live.
82. It‚Äôs going to be kept for the full 4 year term
83. How would you be able to keep something that is losing money hand over fist?
84. You forget fairs were cheaper until labour massively increased them up against all advice about pushing people back into cars. Their stunt did not work......
85. they said they would continue them. Long term i dont necessarily agree it's the best use of $1.2billion, if it were a choice between that and funding 15min frequency on rail lines through off-peak as well as peak, in addition to extra BUZ services and infrastructure upgrades, i think i'd prefer the later. But understand my situation is different to others, i dont have the expensive long commutes of some.
86. It is in their costings report that they will keep it permanently and they actually have a higher budget amount for 50 cents than Labor.
87. I would increase it to $2 per trip, still cheap but hopefully break even.
88. Dunno mate. Have to ask yourself what Hitler or a dictator would do because all I‚Äôve seen on here is people comparing the current party to him.
89. 50c is ridiculous. Should be $5 a day and 1/2 for concession. Why should taxpayers pay for public transport? The user pays for road tolls. Should the taxpayer buy me a car? Or 50c taxi fare because PT is not available. Why should tax payers who don't use it pay for the whole network running and maintenance costs.
90. Train fares may as well be free, I haven‚Äôt used my card in years, just walk past the scanner.
91. Yes yes yes! I hope it also increases people using public facilities like the state library and museum. Now it's only 50 cents for me to get to the city Ive been randomly going in with my baby just for something to do. Its way easier than packing up the car, sitting on the M1, trying to find a park (and paying for it).
92. Yeah, I hope it keeps going. My very first trip I met a single mum and her kids and the kids friends going in to Southbank for the day, and the kids had never been on a train before. Would have been quite an experience.
93. > It was promised to be kept. We'll find out if it was one of those core or non-core promises.
94. PT is increasingly becoming subsidised in many countries and cities around the world [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_public_transport)
95. Probably good for a lot of small businesses near stations as they'd be getting a lot more spontaneous foot traffic as opposed to people just driving by
96. As someone who has to drive a car for work, I don‚Äôt think it really had the effect we were all hoping for, might have taken 1 in 20 cars off the road. But we should definitely keep the 50c fairs and look at other ways to get more cars off the road
97. >I hope that that the money potentially saved by less cars on roads would require less widening of major roads and that be funneled back into public transport infrastructure. Lolololololol...... You don't drive much around Brisbane. The increase in traffic, and thus congestion in the last 6 or so has been insane.
98. Main problem with the policy is that it only benefits people who have access to good public transport, which tends to be people who live in richer areas. I think the money would be better spent on public transport infrastructure, but that‚Äôs not election year policy because it‚Äôs takes time to pay off.
99. I just had to explain to the sub 23yo's at work the whole "blame the outgoing party" for cancelling election promises concept
100. And they have to make up for the reduced income from lowering mining royalties somehow. I suspect they will shaft the general public in favour of the mining companies.
101. Well they already started walking back nuclear power on Saturday night.
102. This is exactly what's gonna happen. Prepare for the sell off.
103. Good initiatives get overshadowed by budget talks. I hope they realize the benefits of affordable transport and keep it going for everyone‚Äôs sake.
104. I reckon this will be more or less how it goes. With a big show and dance about how unfortunate it is.
105. Yeah just gotta keep minimum payments on that maxed out credit card. That minimum payment is about 2 billion dollars a year that could go towards owning some big projects, but anyways.
106. Yep, and in addition they are literally promising to scrap the mining revenue that pays for the 50 cent fares. Plus their voters are less likely to use public transport, as they are older, living in suburbs poorly serviced, or in regional areas. They won't even suffer much of an electoral backlash from their core supporters if they scrap it.
107. Pretty much like Sydney - I can see it happening.
108. And obviously just keeping it 50c without plans to improve public transport. Even it is 50c the entire term people may see it stay the same for the years being meanwhile silently the damage to be done until people realise them not earlier than the term ends.
109. We need to cut renewable planned infrastructure cause we cut the coal tax, but good news coal is cheaper so we can burn that until we get nukes in 20 years time. Don't worry Gina owns both coal and uranium mines, so it is a good policy...for her.
110. First they need to wait and then announce "oh dear, the coffers are empty, it's worse than we thought, bloody Labor!", then they'll scrap the program and give money back to coal mining companies. They'll do it in the first year though, so voters forget they lied.
111. The state was never going to be in a true surplus, Below is the predicted borrowings from the budget. The surplus was only occurring due to borrowing, the surplus in 2026 as you can see below, relies on the net debt increasing by 10 billion or so over that period. We were told the economy was fine, but it really wasn't. The question is how it will be manged moving forward. We all love not paying for things, but the reality is that at some point government income will have to increase, and any mining taxes won't be enough. https://preview.redd.it/k29m6g4ocexd1.png?width=1329&format=png&auto=webp&s=89c66c46bd797366a28f42731936f71b6ad14a69
112. Assuming they don‚Äôt do something else stupid that costs them the next election
