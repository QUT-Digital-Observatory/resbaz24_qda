Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. You'll find that other regional centres are no better eg Cairns, Mackay, Rockhampton, Mt Isa. There are also large sections of Brisbane that are no better, and houses are priced accordingly. If you can afford to live in the more expensive parts of any city you'll find that the crime is a lot better, and Townsville is no exception. Also, living out of town a bit can help a lot too. Try living in Belgian gardens or Bushland beach or Alice River or Chelsea place and you'll probably see a big improvement. The issue is whether you can afford it. But it's the same in Brisbane. Live somewhere affordable like Collingwood Park, Forest lake, Springfield etc and you'll likely have the same poor experiences. Live in Graceville or Indooroopilly or St Lucia and you'll be fine. It's all about $
2. Everyone that posts about moving TO Townsville is pretty educated by Townsville peeps about all the things you‚Äôve posted. None of this is new information, people really should actually stay for a few weeks before deciding to relocate and research the history and socioeconomic disadvantages of being in this region. North QLD is not for everyone.
3. Kirwan is pretty variable. My experience has been pretty different to yours, and I‚Äôve lived some dodgy places in townsville. I would be frustrated with these shenanigans too. I‚Äôve had one attempt two years ago, and I live in a suburb that seems to be regularly targeted, to boot. Good luck with whatever you choose, moving, better security or big dogs.
4. My only recommendation is plant some Bougainvillea around those windows and the thorns will keep most of them away! So sorry you‚Äôve had to deal with this ‚òπÔ∏è our house is like Fort Knox after 15+ years here
5. Cue the people on reddit telling you that because of trends in statewide crime stats you must be imagining your local crime.
6. If its an option to swap a house - there are much better places to live around Townsville. Lived here 3 years and outter suburbs are much better, less scum. North shore, Burdell, Cosgrove, Bohle Plains, Harris Crossing.
7. I mean, no offence, but Kirwan would be one of the last places I would chose to live if I looked at the crime rates re. theft, robbery, unlawful entry ect. Like most urban centers, Townsville has its hot spots, and that area and its surrounding suburbs are deep in it. [I've spent the majority of my life in Townsville, and the Kirwan/Rasmussen/Condon area is the only place I've ever personally felt unsafe. ](https://ibb.co/FD1qSqF)
8. I would feel the same way if I'd been through that many break in attempts :( I've lived here over a decade and not had a single incident like that. I did get a bike stolen in North Ward but that's it. If I were you I'd consider moving. I know that's easier said than done but it's what I would do to feel safe.
9. Sorry it didn't work out for you here, but temper your expectations if you think moving to Brisbane would be any different.
10. Lived in Townsville 2016-2021. Aitkenvale, Kirwan, Annandale, West-End. Except for Aitkenvale, I had break ins at each property. Always happened in Feb-March and Oct-November. In each instance where I had a security camera, it was youths of a certain persuasion, but that is merely a common demographic and means nothing really. I managed to retrieve 100% of my valuables and had the criminals persecuted because I took steps (don‚Äôt thief from a technician for a major telco). Crime is like water, it follows the path of least resistance. Do what you have to do and take steps. Townsville is classed as a remote location. It‚Äôs not Brisbane or Sydney. Best of luck.
11. Ok so first mistake was choosing Townsville in general over Brisbane. You can do everything fun in Townsville in one weekend and then all everyone does it drink. Just look at the parks for examples. There's literally zero reasons why people would move to Townsville other than for a job they got.
12. Please explain how public servants have been bundled up in your issue with crime? I agree the crime is too high in Townsville. Do you think the public servants are committing the crimes?
13. It is a pretty rough town. We‚Äôre here for 2 years now and still feel that we don‚Äôt belong. In our last place we‚Äôve had 3 attempted break ins. A lot of people recommended us to get a dog but it‚Äôs difficult when you‚Äôre still renting. Hopefully things will get better for you mate
14. I hope you‚Äôre renting and are able to move, there are safe and quiet areas in Townsville that have lovely communities. I‚Äôm on the south side and been here for over 20 years, most neighbours are long term residents too. The only crime we have is opportunists, ie you forgot to lock up, or bikes stolen in yards. Keep looking and best wishes
15. I lived in Townsville for 5 years, left in 2018 and it was due to the increasing crime, a break in to my home, my neighbour waking up to an intruder kissing her, someone being tazed in my front yard and much more. I also worked in real estate and out of all the houses I managed (190) least broken into homes was Vincent cos they don‚Äôt üí© where they sleep so they were ‚Äúlucky‚Äù. It‚Äôs honestly the pits up there.
16. Kirwan is really 3 or 4 suburbs rolled into one massive suburb. Some parts are great, others are terrible.
17. Lived in Townsville most of my life and have never had a problem - I do know people that have, but me and my family, none. It very much depends on where you live. Theres pockets of Kirwan that are nice, there‚Äôs pockets that are absolute ghetto.
18. The crime is shocking everywhere, but Kirwan - it‚Äôs far enough out and suburban enough to be the perfect target for crime. Townsville is a large regional city so it‚Äôs not going to grow as quickly as a major city like Brisbane or Sydney. We‚Äôre going to have a water park here soon. There are major developments to upgrade the city, making the stadium area far better. The outer suburbs are also growing. But if you don‚Äôt like it here there‚Äôs really only 2 solutions - learn to like it here, or leave.
19. Born and raised there in the 90's/ early 2000's. I NEVER recommend Townsville to anyone unless they are single and serving (to find someone to get them out of there) or elderly with lots of cash so they can get a good home and security and live in a good neighbourhood. The locals screwed it over when they refused to add more things for kids to do, then they refused to fix the city centre from the shitfight it was (in some places still is with half the streets still chockers with dilapidated 1980's buildings) and then refused to crack down on youth crime because *insert your favourite justification here, there's plenty*. I went back there and lived for about five years, I only ever go back with work or to see remaining family who live there... Until government gets serious there, you shouldn't have gone past the Brisbane Line...
20. First mistake was moving to Townsville. Second mistake was not leaving.
21. Sorry to hear about your experience. I've been living in Kirwan for 7 years now and have only had one instance of kids trying our front door. I'm up near the Av Tav/ dog park and even have a gully close by which I thought would likely be a trouble spot but not at all. There's a select few streets that I would only recommend to my enemies, the likes of kittyhawk cres, easterbrook cres, Hudson Street. A quick drive there will show you how terrible it is. Crime is everywhere, but you are in the thick of it if you are down in that cluster
22. Far out. I grew up in Townsville in the 70's and 80's, Kirwan was the boonies....... Apart from that I can't help you. Sorry society has broken down to this level.....
23. Get a German Shepherd, not just as a mobile security device, they are just amazing family dogs too.
24. The Brisbane subreddit will tell you that crime is down and youth crime isn‚Äôt a problem.
25. Sounds to me like the town residents need to start a public whippings of any wrong doers.
26. My family made the decision to leave Townsville before our eldest had to start high school. We bought in an area that is considered dodgy in our new city and I feel safer than I ever felt in Townsville. I don't hide my keys or handbag anymore or get up in the middle of the night to check I key locked the doors. I do miss Townsville and the great friends we made but we've made the best decision for our family.
27. Sorry, but our locals have been saying this all along. Everyone from the capital cities gaslight us by saying, "crime is everywhere," or it's not as bad as ... Even when people post on Facebook and here, the locals warn people, and still, people minimise our lived experience. If you are going to Brisbane, consider the south side. Places like Wynnum and manly that used to have a bad reputation have cleaned themselves up. Also, check with the locals, and don't be like others and try and compare to where you have lived. If they are saying it's bad, then it's bad.
28. Moved back here from a rather well to do area of Sydney, it's like chalk and cheese. Down south there is home invasions and car jackings flat out. Elderly people beaten waiting for public transport. Having been back a year have had less sirens, less helicopters flying over, and less unsettling moments when doing daily tasks. Seen a lot less public overdoses. And am less worried when taking the kids to the park that some junkie has hidden a syringe in playground equipment.
29. this is exactly why we need to make nq its own state
30. I live in north ward (near TSV grammar) and hate it. The level of noise with the medium density living and sporting fields is insane. Fairly sure I have PTSD from the sirens of the football field. It has seriously effected me. Also, most ppl I have spoken to in this area have had several attempted break ins as well. I want to move so bad. I'm looking out as far as ingham to live because I'm so jack of the noise and crime. I recently took a promotion here so have to stay but this place really effects my mental health. I definitely understand what OP is saying.
31. On the old side..never had a problem. New Kirwan gets all the break ins
32. I grew up in Townsville (late 30s now). Grew up in Aitkenvale. Lived in the city, west end, Belgian gardens, new Kirwan, Aitkenvale again, mundingburra, south Townsville and I now own a place in the old area of Kirwan towards Cranbrook. I have only had 1 incident back when I was in year 12( early 2000s). I came home drunk.from a party and left the garage door and front gate completely open. Kid came in and we saw each other and he ran away. That's it. I know that Burdell, north shore and the newer areas of Kirwan have a lot of break and enters but this is in general a safe place. I never feel unsafe walking even at night. I feel like a lot of people aren't used to seeing black people on the street walking around and shit themselves whenever they see them. It's NQ. We have indigenous people here. Deal with it. The vast majority of them are good people like everyone else.
33. Kirwan is central because it‚Äôs one of the biggest and oldest, there‚Äôs a street that leads almost directly to each surrounding suburb very easily and it‚Äôs about the most central a western suburb can be, people say it‚Äôs the worst for crime but it‚Äôs simply the fact it‚Äôs so large
34. Well when you open a map, and look at the whole of Townsville. Kirwan is like sorta in the middle of it all
35. I wouldent call Springfield affordable anymore. My sisters 3 bedroom townhouse there is valued at 800k. Median property price is $785,000.
36. This is good advice, and I recommend you stay in the months of December and January. Dont come in July and think everything is great, the weather in summer will make you think twice.
37. Yeah definitely agree you've gotta trial living in FNQ, especially during wet season. People don't appreciate just how convenient/accessible life elsewhere in the country is. From big things like accessing doctors (particularly specialists), to little stuff like mail taking longer, it all adds up to quite a big change of lifestyle. One that I think is worth it, but you've gotta find out for yourself.
38. It's interesting, I've lived in a bunch of "dodgy" places and a couple of really, really nice ones. While the nice ones were safer to walk around in, they were the ones that I had the most thefts in. Most of the dodgy people don't shit in their own backyard, and they know that the valuable items aren't in that area anyway.
39. They would be wrong. Per population Townsville has the highest youth crime rate in Queensland and it's not even close.
40. North Shore and Burdell have high crime rates in terms of stolen cars though. Not saying they are not nice suburbs, but crime can be anywhere.
41. Brisbane is awesome. Move there and try it out. I did and loved it, I regret coming back to Townsville.
42. Brisbane is awesome. Move there and try it out. I did and loved it, I regret coming back to Townsville.
43. I think it was the part where he stated they were called and didn‚Äôt bother rocking up. It‚Äôs right there in the post.
44. I‚Äôve been here for 20 years and I feel like it‚Äôs gone so far downhill in the last 5 or so in terms of crime. OP is also living in hard mode in Kirwan. There are some streets there that seem to be terrible and some nice ones.
45. See this is wild to me, is there not a third option where the council sorts its shit out and sends twice as many cops thats needed to sort the area out? Thats what many states do when a town gets overrun by the crime. The whole accept it or move out attitude is incredibly incorrect. Thats partly what I'm saying in the above post.
46. At the end of the day, the lived experience is all that matters. Not a single person that has been in this town for 20 years is going to believe crime is better now. We see it. We haven't all got amnesia.
47. Cool. Now show data for Townsville only. Who's misusing data now?
48. Yes, what is it about Townsville locals that make them commit crimes? Bit rich that Townsville locals blame other areas for their own self made problems.
49. One of our rules is don‚Äôt be a dick, you‚Äôve broken that rule by name calling, using and ethnic or racial slur, some other pejorative term, threatening to hurt children, or some other dickish comment.
50. Granted, I'm only up here for work for a few weeks, but the times I've been out after dark and been verbally abused reminds me of being back in Katherine NT. I have only been verbally abused by the indigenous.
51. Kirwan used to be in a whole different city. It may be 'central' if you compare it's position to Kelso and Bushland Beach but they're just other suburban areas. The only place worth living in Townsville is near the Strand.
52. I think it‚Äôs worth it too. It‚Äôs also part of the lifestyle which requires patience üôÇ
53. I used to find it that way, but I think anyone‚Äôs fair game these days. I‚Äôm in Idalia, nowadays there‚Äôs a fair amount of movement- but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs more than it used to be or not, because I only got vigilant after the 2019 floods, we were one of about six houses in the street that were habitable. There were a lot of creepers about.
54. Police is quicker to type than Public Servant with an implied tone of meaning Police.
55. It's been going downhill since they closed David Jones in the mall. I agree with the poster above, Ive been here most of my life and don't feel like I belong. I lived elsewere (big city) and I felt at home, I felt invisible or blended, (thats a good thing to me as you feel part of the place). Townsville feels foreign and I don't fit in.
56. why would council have anything to do with State police? and where do would you like the new coppers to come from? Grab em from logan? Rocky? Gold Coast? maybe even Inala? You need to think
57. Council has nothing whatsoever to do with the police. Why would you possibly think they do?
58. Tell me, without expecting others to change, what‚Äôs within your control?
59. That's Townsville locals for you though, why do you keep committing crimes?
60. I can't even remember the last time an indigenous person said anything to me like that. Been years. I only.get asked for money once every few years. It's not even a big deal. " Hey brudda can you spot me $2/smoke." Me " sorry mate I don't have any". Ends like that most times I still laugh about the time someone called me a captain cook cunt back in the day though.
61. And the four people verbally abusing me from inside their shitty ute whilst speeding off were (using your verbiage) the Anglos.
62. You must be rich to be able to say that
63. This maybe your opinion that close to the strand is the only place here worth living but I like living in bushland beach never had a problem here a lot of my friends live at Yarrawonga and northward garbutt and railway estate and they and their neighbours are constantly having break ins stolen cars and home intrusions in board daylight. People living in yarrawonga can barely feel safe washing their car!
64. I found cost of living lower there, food, power, insurances were all lower. Cost of housing is now higher but wasnt *that* much higher at the time. When my car insurance came up for renewal it was by chance that I updated my new living address and literally the price halved, and the person from the insurance company said to me it was due to crime and weather of North Queensland. Which I found puzzling since Brisbane is known to hail somewhat regularly.
65. Police are public servants though‚Ä¶ and for sure, I would have written police.
66. The council can request the extra resources from the government. Thats one of the ways to get the resources. Cops are paid to relocate all the time. Especially newer ones to get their first big posts.
67. Easy, you just get them from NZ. 300 NZ police applied to join the qld force in July.
68. Theres nothing really I can do. We moved into a rental to suss out Townsville for a year. So we cant make any modifications to the property. Cant get a dog. I feel helpless and not supported by the council and government and police. I fear for my family.
69. The Anglos haven't called me a white c%%t, hounding me for money or anything like that.
70. Bushy Beach and North Ward/Castle Hill are pretty similar. [https://qps-ocm.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/index.html](https://qps-ocm.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/index.html)
71. Agree, it just reads weird and suggests to me they are capturing more than just police.
72. More police wouldn't solve the issue anyway. The problem is the magistrates not doing anything with the ones that get caught. There is no deterrent to youth crime, I takes literally hundreds of offenses before there is a consequence outside of saying sorry or a curfew that has no punishment when it is broken.
73. you clearly don‚Äôt know what ur talking about. Plus there is a new Kirwan Police Facility being built with more coppers..
74. Well, you can choose how to respond to this.. you can‚Äôt make modifications but you can request an upgrade in security measures for the house. Getting a dog isn‚Äôt going to solve this problem for you, all a dog will do is add a deterrent to the property, and that‚Äôs only if you train it properly. I honestly think it‚Äôs a bit rich that you blame the council for this when they aren‚Äôt responsible for law enforcement and deployment of police to problem areas. This town is what you make of it. It‚Äôs either going to be shit and you‚Äôre going to remain miserable and scared, or you can look at all the positives and make the best of the situation. You aren‚Äôt powerless to this problem. At least you have a house, some people don‚Äôt. At least you haven‚Äôt been injured by the crime, others have. Make sure you have contents insurance, lock your cars, lock your house, make sure your windows are not accessible and be vigilant. If you look like you‚Äôre poor from the outside view of the house you‚Äôre less likely to be targeted also.
75. If you don't mind me asking, is your house a typical Kirwan deal where the house is part of the fence? Like it just opens the garage on to the street?
76. I've been over that way for 4 years and not a single *serious* issue like I've heard about elsewhere in town. One young fella thought he'd be smart and hang off the outside of my fence next to my cars but my dog grabbed his arm before anything got out of hand.
77. Unlike Kirwan and the Strand, Aitkenvale is actually central and actually has access to whatever you need. You have Stockland there for most things, there's work there, and if you need to go elsewhere, all the buses stop there.
78. Similar-ish northward is still higher than bushy for unlawful entry and other theft as well as just unlawful entry so to say near the strand is better when it's actually worse ü§®
79. Second aitkenvale, you just have to find the hidden gem houses and streets. Lots of old people that have owned houses for 40-50 years so it's generally quiet. No more than 15 minutes to anywhere.
80. Anywhere worth going to is near the Strand, you don't need to be central to travel out to Kelso.
81. If you don't want to rely on a car, you do.
82. Work, shops, friends places. Nowhere in the city, the city sucks.
83. Townsville is great if you love nature and wildlife and the outdoors. The weather takes a little to get used to; especially moving here in Summer. So start off indoors üòÖ, but relief comes when winter roles around. It‚Äôs a great time to get out and about. If you don‚Äôt scuba dive already, it‚Äôs a great place to get into it. Or climbing. And there are clubs at JCU so you can meet people and make friends. JCU has dorms, but it depends on your budget. I‚Äôve heard they can be a little pricey. I think you‚Äôre better off jumping on FB and joining the JCU students groups about accommodation. Share houses are the norm I think. Nightlife isn‚Äôt huge, but it‚Äôll do if you‚Äôre drunk and not fussyüòÖ. People will comment here about the crime. It‚Äôs not that bad in terms of personal safety - I‚Äôm a woman and I don‚Äôt feel unsafe walking around at night. But kids steal cars, so just be sensible. Overall, Townsville is a pretty great place if you like a slower pace and less traffic and lots of sunshine. If you like shopping and cold weather, maybe not.
84. I lived in a share house with two vet students who grew up elsewhere. They enjoyed it there and seemed to have a good study/life balance. The had enough social interactions throughout the year with other students from what I saw. I moved up from Sydney about 10 years ago and have loved the relaxed lifestyle. People will act like it's like moving to the Bronx but as long as you're security conscious, crime won't impact your life. If you end up moving up there and get stuck with anything, give me a yell
85. I moved from Brisbane to go to JCU and moved back a year later cause I hated it so much. Despite everyone else‚Äôs comments, I personally have not had a good experience with crime, finding a rental, and the climate. As someone from a big city, there is absolutely nothing to do here but outdoor activities for which it‚Äôs too hot 90% of the time. Townsville to me feels like a big retirement village with a few army blokes thrown into the mix üòÇ
