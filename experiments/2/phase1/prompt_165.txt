Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. The usual LNP thing will happen. Cuts everywhere and the savings passed on to their mining and business mates. They will back policy that is pushed by the ultra religious elements of the party as they have been getting more and more influence in the party every year. So expect the tightening on abortion laws. I fully expect a backflip on the no nuclear so they align with Dutton and his horribly ill thought out nuclear plan that doesn't even stack up to his own details let alone to reality of how it would really work. Labour might suck and only manage to help some people but at least they try where as the LNP actively work against everyone except their own rich mates.
2. The first thing they'll do is legislate record low mining royalties. And they'll lock them in for 20 years.
3. Politicians of all persuasions are well known for backtracking on election promises. No doubt some will be fulfilled but this will be difficult in a hung parliament if thus b isbwaht happens.
4. As a rule of thumb, vote on who or what represents you best. Not your friends or family
5. The only things Chrisafuli promised that his party is ideologically committed to are allowing mining companies to profit and pollute more, gutting ministries and departments, and allowing abortion to be re-criminalised.
6. They're going to throw all the Aboriginal kids in jail and repeal abortion.
7. You'll be old enough to vote by 2028. My best advice to you is stay engaged. Ignoring politics outside of elections is bad business, for everyone. We have to stay engaged, keep paying attention, keep speaking out if the government tries to implement bad policies. All we can do is wait and see. Crisafulli says he won't decimate the public service and healthcare system like he did last time. But I also know he has a history of going back on his word. I'm also old enough to remember the Newman government, it's why the LNP spent a decade in opposition. The optimist in me believes the Liberals won't try Newman 2.0 ... The cynic in me and my gut instinct says otherwise. So again, my best advice, stay engaged, make sure you enroll when you turn 18 and pay attention to what is happening in politics. Read as much objective information as you can when you can, so that when you do vote, you'll be able to make an informed decision based on what you want out of your government üëç
8. First quarter, nothing. ride the train blame labor for everything. 2nd 1/4. start selling assets, blame labor for the need to sell them. 3rd holiday mode, blame labor for as they continue to sell services. 4th: brag about how much money they made, how great the budget looks, blame labor the jobs crisis and cost of living issues we will be facing, premier to personally suck off the CEO of coles and woolworths (blame labor for the mess they leave on the floor)
9. Politics is absolutely important. You really don't need to be a political wizz, but it is detrimental to your future living condition to be absent minded about politics. If you don't care about politics, you are basically saying that you don't care how you're going to be living in the future. It could be that voting now, could prevent you from having to live in desperation in the future. Think of it this way, you don't need ambulance insurance in QLD, if you need an ambulance, it's free, why? Politics, and it's only the case in Queensland, the other states do not get this luxury. Medicare used to be a whole lot better, but it's stagnated over the past decade and now no longer covers the entirety of a doctor's appointment, why? Politics. If you "don't care about politics" then you are signing yourself up to sleepwalk into your worst possible future. You'll only care about politics when it's too late.
10. It's going to be hard gauging a response from reddit as I have a feeling most reddit users in Australia would be leaning to the left. The amount of pro/bashing left/right side of politics I don't think is reflective of the real world as most of the noise is coming from the left who, as the results speak for themselves, are in the minority.
11. If you like labor, you‚Äôll love the Greens. Seriously check out www.greens.org.au/qld/plan
12. I've never understood how people become so passionate about politics. Nothing ever changes. The only thing that remains consistent is lies and broken promises. The two major political parties (exactly like the US) are two sides of the same coin dressed up in different meat suits and logos and they have us fooled making us believe it's a democracy. Letting politics control your emotions and dictate your life is one of the worst ways to live. This is why I donkey vote; nothing changes or ever will change, and you're an oblivious slave to modern society if you really believe our votes and opinions matter.
13. You‚Äôll find that Steve was appealing to a target demographic that was more likely to shift their votes towards him. Even with that huge campaign, he didn‚Äôt stay in. Queensland is a big broad state with many different people from all walks of life. More of those people believed that LNP would provide a better outcome, or rather more believed that ALP had their time. Youth crime is a very topical point. There are a wide range of views but ultimately there are good arguments for both. A lot of the offending does happen because as a minor they get a slap on the wrist, and I believe as a minor they cannot cite past offences at all (unless the minor brings it up) so they continue to get a slap on the wrist based on precedence. Personally I don‚Äôt agree with LNP anti abortion ideals, but I think that is the result of the noisy minority inside LNP. I think overall they will perform better than ALP but time will tell, I can‚Äôt say for sure. From a politics perspective, I have quite a libertarian view. Everyone is equal regardless of demographic. No favouritism or anything for gender or colour. Maintained and improved access to recreational liberties. Hunting on public land (in reasonable places; state forest, remote national park, pests in conservation reserves etc). We should all have equitable access to public land. If something is declared sacred we should look after it, but also be able to experience it in some capacity; see Lake Tali Karng. Freedom of expression and choice is important to me
14. There may be a bit less resources spent on treaty, truth-telling and reperations.. https://www.dsdsatsip.qld.gov.au/our-work/aboriginal-torres-strait-islander-partnerships/reconciliation-tracks-treaty/tracks-treaty/path-treaty
15. "what ive heard about LNP is that there going to toughen abortion laws and make youth crime worse (putting bigger prison sentences is not changing a thing, work on the quality of life so the kids get raised better)" Are you asking a question, or making a statement? The election is over. You can stop campaigning now.
16. this especially the bit about football teams. The reason we have issues in our society is because about 2/3rds of voters support the same party no matter what they do. Best advice is to fact check everything if it concerns you. Also be aware a government can't instantly change things. some things might take years to fix, if they even want to fix them.
17. Thanks for the advice, you saying ill be 70 one day does sound weird thoüòÇ
18. That‚Äôs a great attitude to have. The days of blindly following some party should be over. We should be smarter than that!
19. At the same time has the LNP/Coalition of Liberal/National/Country parties ever not been shit? Go back 70 years through QLD politics. It‚Äôs gerrymandering, corruption and fuck the working class.
20. Yeh that's all very nice, but I've been waiting 40 years for the chance to vote LNP.... they've never given me enough reason to.
21. ‚ÄúIf you are not a swinging voter, you are dangerous‚Äù my friend‚Äôs dad.
22. Don't forget selling assets like our generators/grid and Energy QLD
23. Don‚Äôt underestimate what changing the preferential voting system will do. It advantages the LNP. If they try and bring it in, we need to hit the streets. It‚Äôs a backwards step for democracy and it‚Äôs democracy we need to protect.
24. I don't like the bloke, but he explicitly said there will be no changes to abortion laws under his government. Is he lying? I guess we'll see.
25. You say he has officially pledged to remove coal royalties and wind back the clock on abortion rights. You then put in brackets that he has not actually said that. OP these are the exact kind of emotionally charged political comments you should ignore or at the least be wary of. There‚Äôs virtually zero chance the LNP go after abortion. It would be political suicide in Australia. Like end of the party level suicide. They have not campaigned on it. If they tried to do it, the protests would be insane and the GC would likely have to dissolve parliament and force another election at which the LNP would be annihilated. It simply will not happen and was never more than an effective Labour scare campaign. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†literally watch it not happen.
26. Alright thanks i will. I do know that he was a LNP member and not liked alot but im not to sure why, Ill ask my dad. Thanks.
27. What I don't get is that "Youth Crime" was a significant part of this election, but the Police stats show that Youth Crime in QLD was falling under the ALP now so why is it an issue?
28. Anyone knows how or why they are changing political donation rules? Seems like opening of more pathways to corruption
29. Coal tax reform is gone, no more 50c fares - these will be quietly withdrawn in a few months time, coincidentally after some other issue randomly appears.
30. >but we are a democracy and the population has changed the gov so it is what it is. We are a democracy now. When he gets rid of preferential voting, we will no longer be a true democracy. Truly terrifying policy, but Queenslanders voted for it.
31. Yes! And do it a few times until you are 30, as your views change. It‚Äôs important to vote with your values!
32. He'll just sack public servants, outsource their work, and call them private sector jobs (even though the govt is still paying)
33. If parents bothered to parent their children there wouldn‚Äôt be the need for them to be pissed off about searches.
34. I will be messaging you in 1 year on [**2025-10-26 19:46:48 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2025-10-26%2019:46:48%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/queensland/comments/1gckjre/what_is_lnp_going_to_do_and_is_anything_actually/ltwdw79/?context=3) [**2 OTHERS CLICKED THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fqueensland%2Fcomments%2F1gckjre%2Fwhat_is_lnp_going_to_do_and_is_anything_actually%2Fltwdw79%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202025-10-26%2019%3A46%3A48%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam. ^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%201gckjre) ***** |[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)| |-|-|-|-|
35. It won‚Äôt be relevant to the OP, unless he is a POS and deserves to be in prison‚Ä¶.
36. Or you could be a decent human being and vote for a better world for everyone?
37. It will change. Not one environment NGO is welcoming LNP. Not one community development org is welcoming LNP. They are environmental and social vandals
38. The artificial categories of left and right are just a pervasive nonsense to keep you thinking like a football supporter. There are simply policies that are either socially responsible, equitable and address the root causes of systemic disadvantage or that ignore those issues because they only affect someone else. The LNP are firmly in the ‚Äúlooking after myself, fuck everyone else‚Äù group. Labor are somewhat in both of those camps these days as they try to appeal to lifetime Liberal/National voters. And the Greens are all about everyone receiving and contributing their fair share and levelling-up everyone‚Äôs starting point so we all get a chance to achieve in a capitalist society. Don‚Äôt think based upon the election result that people desiring equity and a fair go for all are the minority. A large part of this outcome resulted from multi-million dollar media disinformation campaigns, blatant lies that were believed by the gullible and widespread apathy and ignorance of how our political system actually works. The way to effectively address the latter is through more spending on our dismally underfunded public education system but that is now pretty unlikely for another 4 years as the LNP only want education for the wealthy.
39. Electricity cheaper under LNP? You'd have to be dumber than dog shit to believe that.
40. Why‚Äôs that exactly mate? You wanna explain your point or just cry out at a 17 year old trying to understand the politics that affect him?
41. So 75% of the LNP voter base would be out because of that 2nd one
42. Oh fuck yes I love merit based voting that's such a good idea that definitely is not a major discriminator against young and low socio-economic background people
43. 17 year olds will live with our voting choices long after we‚Äôre dead. If anything it‚Äôs the people with a 50/50 chance of living out the term that shouldn‚Äôt be voting. They have less skin in the game.
44. I think their statement of what they've heard includes an opinion - OP seems to be wondering if what they've heard (the statement) is true, and shared a bit of their own opinion on one of the things they've heard can you help OP? did you want to say it's not true? I feel like it could be very helpful to OP and others reading to know if what a lot of people are hearing is true as we all have our own opinions! I feel like being sarcastic(?) can be seen as rude for no reason when they're asking for help. I'm sorry if the perception of this is wrong though!! just, your own last sentences don't seem very kind or informative -- also sorry I wrote a lot, unsure if your own question is genuine üòÖ
45. There are many things the legislative arm of govt can change rapidly, especially without a balancing bicameral parliament. Even then, there are many changes to the running of day to day govt that can be impacted.
46. What if no matter how bad one party gets, the other one is always worse?
47. To be fair, it'd help a lot of we had some credible parties that aren't just the major two. Like LNP vs KAP/ON (et al) isn't really a choice of policy or views but how much chaos & shitfuckery you can tolerate. Same thing for the Greens and APL.
48. Actually I meant 87 haha, but yeah same same. World will change an incredible lot in that time, would love to be able to time travel to the year 2094 and ask you to reflect
49. you are the person that comment OP is warning post OP not to become like lmaoo.
50. In the context of this thread your reply is not helpful, and the exact thing I‚Äôve warned the 17yo about. FO with your propaganda
51. He said he won't change the law. But he has not answered when asked if he will put forward a conscience vote, which would have the same result, and he's been asked it a lot.
52. It is Katter that will table the bill and the LNP do individual conscience votes. So he‚Äôs not exactly lying, HE‚Äôs not going to make a change but they will still vote to criminalise it if/when Katter puts his bill up.
53. If it changes, KAP will table the bill and he will allow a conscience vote, then he can weasel word say it wasn't him.
54. He also said he would keep the 50c bus fares.
55. Only person 100% lying is the person who posted the comment saying he refused to clarify
56. After the effect of that possibility, don't think he will think about it this term. Plus big donations are from coal companies. So I think he will do what coal companies paid him to do and then with whatever left over he will try to secure votes for next term. So I'm expecting stuff on coal, nuclear, privatisation etc. Not expecting him to bring up abortion and he will beg katter privately to shut up about abortion. If his team isn't united, then he won't last full term.
57. LNP in SA went after abortion rights. LNP in QLD will 100% go after abortion rights.
58. The LNP aren't going to table the bill, but enough of them (including Chrisafuli) are staunchly anti-abortion, so when the Katter party table it, it will get through. Chrisafuli will then say that he just promised not to introduce the bill himself.
59. > im not to sure why He sacked 12,000 public servants as soon as he got elected, brought in draconian anti-bikie laws and tried to lease state assets out for 99 years to private companies. Expect the same sort of stuff from Crisafulli over the next four years.
60. Like taking your kid to the hospital after hours cos there's no other option and being sent away because of all the staff cuts
61. Public service was/is full of a lot of useless people and many of the comments you read on reddit don‚Äôt like the fact that they actually had to go and do some real work or they lost their jobs..
62. It's not an issue, it's just a misconception drilled into the public by a mixture of media sensationalism from News Corps and Nine and the wide spread of anecdotes driven by community groups online and social media algorithms.
63. Because it‚Äôs falling in SEQ and not the rest of the state. Furthermore I understand there are more repeat offenders - which means whatever methods are being used to stop them isn‚Äôt working and they go straight back to it.
64. Considering the Greens refuse all corporate donations because it negatively impacts the political process, then yes, changing the laws to make the LNP richer, more powerful and corrupt is not a good development
65. I think the plan was to turn it from mandatory to voluntary. You can either choose to give your preferences or not give them..
66. To be fair, Labor did exactly the same thing when they were up in the two party preferred ranking. Then they changed it back when they needed preferences. Chrisafuli is only getting one term, and that's if no one in the LNP knifes him.
67. We only stop being a democracy at the state level if FPTP is instated, and that requires a statewide referendum
68. If the parents didn't have to work 3 jobs, maybe they would have the time to. I'm sure you would follow around your 16-17 year olds 24/7, they would love that.
69. Well he did say his mates like to fare-dodge, sound like crims to me.
70. That is voting on your own though right? If that's how you choose it's fine. I generally too, vote for the greater good for all
71. bahaaaa did you think the $1000 electricity subsidy would continue.
72. They are a 1 hour old account. Downvote the cooker and move on.
73. This person was raised in the internet era, they have everything they need at their fingertips to obtain a comprehensive understanding of every party's platform, and yet they make some poorly spelled & punctuated ramble vaguely questioning the policies that have been front & centre in the media for weeks. The fact you have to ask speaks volumes, "mate".
74. Sounds good to me. The whole point is achieving the best outcome for the electorate, not cheering on your "team" because of the lure of tribalism.
75. sure thats pretty much the ACT right now. But you can always vote for independents and minor parties first then preference the major parties lower down. The only way to really tell both major parties they are bad is for people to stop putting a number 1 next to them.
76. What if there‚Äôs more than one party? Holy crap there is! Well would you look at that
77. That‚Äôs when you vote for a third party but always preference the less bad one
78. okay now 87 is beyond my imagination lol. I keep a Journal so ill write something about this and come back in 70 years to reflect.
79. you're making me feel real young now. You got any good advice or quotes for me lol?
80. If we don‚Äôt learn from history we‚Äôre doomed to repeat it.
81. Now you‚Äôre obviously speaking shit. Malcolm Turnbull was PM at the time. Penny Wong didn‚Äôt vote against it. Abbott actually didn‚Äôt even vote, he abstained despite the nation clearly wanting it. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-08/same-sex-marriage-who-didnt-vote/9240584 That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt listen to tories glorifying swing voting.
82. I‚Äôm sure Abbot would be so happy to hear you crediting him with the legislation of gay marriage üòÇ
83. Yeah because it's a dumb one. I've supported an AFL team since I was a kid... if they're playing another team, am I just supposed to take my gear off and start supporting the other side "because don't be loyal to one team"? It's a stupid analogy, even if you think it isn't. In the words of you: sit down.
84. He's either lying through his teeth or is going to fund it by gutting departments and ministries since he's getting rid of the mining royalties that pay for it.
85. I‚Äôll take the bet. How much do you want to put on it?
86. I‚Äôll say the same thing I‚Äôm saying to others. I‚Äôll take any and all bets on this for any amount right now. The bet is that no anti abortion bill is passed into legislation in this state, in this LNP government.
87. People throw shit on Canberra, but having no Murdoch media impact is one of the best things about living in the ACT. We've had a Labor government for 23 years and they've just been re-elected for another term. It's extremely difficult for the Liberals to get elected here because a) educated population and b) there is no megaphone for their bullshit. The conservative media is a cancer in this country.
88. Like exactly what you just said - there is an issue in other areas of Queensland.
89. It's falling everywhere. Nine/Courier Mail/Sky News/talk back radio just drill the message to the contrary.
90. Which does nothing but weaken our democracy and bring it one step closer to the disaster that is the US. First past the post is a terrible way to have people vote
91. Optional Preferential Voting is in reality, a pseudo FPTP system. People can‚Äôt be fucked spending more than 3 seconds in a booth every 4 years. It‚Äôs worse than you think.
92. They need to work 3 jobs, because of the cost of everything‚Ä¶.. Which government has been in power for like the last 15 out of 18 years? It wasn‚Äôt the LNP.
93. further privatisation of the energy grid would do nothing but increase prices. Also the ALP actually did something about expanding our renewable energy generation which would bring prices down.
94. Well considering that you clearly have such a comprehensive understanding of‚Ä¶ seemingly everything. It seems like he‚Äôs chosen a solid place to ask his question hey? You gonna answer him or just keep whining dude?
95. Sorry if my spelling was incorrect i was on a bus and was typing in a rush, also im not exactly caught up on the politics, witch is why i made this post (the last election was when I was 13).
96. Yes if we were wanting to achieve the best outcome for the electorate, No one should be voting for the LNP.
97. The whole point is insane and a recipe for corruption
98. Thanks for the tip. Cool looking web site. Some interesting ideas but the people need to work on their presentation skills
99. Alright be sure to reply back, I‚Äôll be waiting (likely dead but hey)
100. I‚Äôm only halfway, but my 2c: enjoy your freedom before you ever have kids.
101. It‚Äôs an opinion (not ‚Äúfactually‚Äù correct or incorrect, just an opinion), which everyone is entitled to, and contributes nothing to the context of this thread. Sit down
102. If you don‚Äôt look in the mirror and take a moment to consider your own actions you won‚Äôt learn shit to begin with. How about start there?
103. He abstained from the vote. He wasn‚Äôt PM at the time. Penny Wong obviously didn‚Äôt vote no to it.
104. I imagine you think it‚Äôs a stupid analogy because you‚Äôve got it entirely backwards. Cheers anyway
105. They don't have to win re-election for another four years and by then everyone will have forgotten to be angry.
106. Do you cunts understand that the shit the LNP did last time they were in power still impacts us to this day??
107. Correction. You have had a labor/greens coalition for 14 years. The most stable and effective government in Australia.
108. Cost of living is a result of macroeconomic conditions, which are set at the federal level.
109. Cost of living isn't fully under government control. Unless you can explain why there's the same issues in the rest of the developed world, you can't blame Queensland Labor for that. Especially nor when the few things they could do to help with cost of living are about to get scrapped.
110. i don‚Äôt care centrelink and the land council takes care of our power bills üíµ
