Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. ALP made that reputation? Yet you are proactively blaming LNP. Just listen to yourselves
2. Perhaps.... Reddit is a loud minority? Just maybe? Something to think about
3. As no one will save the LNP Premier next election.
4. Time to steal from woolies and coles I guess. "Wait why is crime going UP didn't we just elect an LNP government!?"
5. You do realise that heaps of people irl don't use reddit?
6. It's just dumb people voting against their own best interests everytime.
7. I never got a chance to try that. Live too far from PT.
8. Most state governments have an upper and lower house, similar to the Federal government. That means that bills/changes in policy are put forward and have to be debated and agreed upon in both houses. Often but not always, the upper and lower house has a different majority, eg LNP in lower house vs Labor in upper. The upper house has to also agree to the bill before it gets through. Queensland doesn't have this, so whoever holds a majority government, especially if each member votes along party lines, can push bills through government very quickly with very little debate or question. That's why Campbell Newman was able to do so much damage in such a short time and what a lot of us are worried about now.
9. You can read the policy platform for what they view as the key issues [here](https://online.lnp.org.au/therightplan). I would have preferred labour, but in my view it is not nearly as bad as everyone here is making it out to be, but make your own decision.
10. *Apparently* Robbie Katter has confirmed they‚Äôre bringing it to the table as soon as possible.
11. It was mostly dumbfucks on the Gold Coast who kicked labor and went LNP. So yeah, retirees and bogans.
12. No, boomers are a very small minority. A majority of QLD has voted LNP. Not just boomers.
13. >I put greens 1, labor 2 and LNP last but what‚Äôs done is done now and it‚Äôs time to try and make strawberry jam from pig shit. Now it's time for me to book a vasectomy because I have the kind of body the religious nutters aren't trying to control.
14. It's been Labor for 30 of the last 35 years. It's the right wing owned media that set the narratives in weak minds.
15. The problem with this election is that the LNP have been running essentially a single issue campaign and were banking on the ‚ÄúTime for a change‚Äù argument from non political voters. Genuinely, what policy from the LNP is actually worth voting on? And this is coming from someone who has traditionally voted blue in most elections. They have had more support from the media, more money donated to them from big business. Everything has been screaming shady for a number of months now.
16. This is so true. The definition of an echo chamber. What people don‚Äôt see through their hatred of the other side is that they are on the slippery American style path. There is nil respect for people with differing views and no attempt to understand it. QLD is not SEQ and demographics vary. While I don‚Äôt take a lot of delight in the LNP winning I respect the democratic process and my fellow Queenslanders, something which seems to be very very lost in this place.
17. It is orchestrated by interest groups. The mods know it but there isn‚Äôt much they can actually do. The problem is reddit advertisers don‚Äôt want an echo chamber so let‚Äôs see what happens. Twitch has just lost a number of big advertising accounts due to the above so reddit may see this and take action.
18. Miles was the one who pushed the QEII option and LNP have said QEII is dead under their government.
19. I voted Labor, but one thing they won‚Äôt be doing is QEII imo. It‚Äôll likely be a new stadium or Gabba Reno imo ,
20. The only good thing from LNP is that we may go back to the Gabba plan and scrap QEII. That was the only thing I didn‚Äôt agree with the ALP on
21. Who fucking cares about sportsball ffs, it's just a big money pit anyways and gonna make the city an absolute cunt to navigate in 2030wheneverthefuckitis
22. u/Fandango70, Good luck in your hunt for an ‚Äúamazonian milky goddess‚Äù in reddit adult breastfeeding personals.
23. You think you're edgy but you need to understand how unbelievably pathetic that is. Enjoy you win, my god.
24. You are valid. ü´Ç We can only hope they get kicked to the curb next time üòë
25. I didn't. I've seen for myself how myopic, selfish and idiotic LNP voters are. 'She's a bully... wonder if she votes LN... yep, she does.'
26. Yeah tell that to the thousands of public servants that will lose their careers and livelihoods over the next 4 years. Their Christmases will be either unemployed or wondering when it's their turn for the axe. Tell that to the millions of people relying on the public services that they provide. Tell that to women who just lost autonomy over their own bodies.
27. You would've thought QLD have just elected a dictator reading some of these comments
28. But if you come back and are lucky enough to purchase a house you‚Äôll now be paying land tax - yipee.
29. He was the Minister for Local Government under Newman, and the Leader of the Opposition since 2020. People need to pay attention to politics outside of the campaign.
30. Uhhh, there's not much wrong with Russia tho... At least they have 50c bus fares and try their best to be supportive of LGBTQIA+ rights.
31. LNP completely gutted enviro laws last time. They pretty much said to their developer and construction/mining mates "build what you want, don't worry about environmental impact". Their plans to "keep running coal plants" are going to be more expensive and more harmful long term. It's terrifying.
32. Said like someone who has never had to face the decision to terminate for medical abnormalities at 22 weeks.
33. According to ABC radio, fares are subsidised to the 10‚Äôs of dollars. Making them $1 will make basically zero difference.
34. There's more issues than unions... Thanks to labor the state was actually receiving royalties and revenue from foreign mining companies which helped pay for 50c fares, when the LNP scrap the royalties they'll be ‚Äúforced‚Äù to sell assets like the ambulance service to a private company which will fuck people over more by forcing them to pay a call out fee on an ambulance when it was free not only that why are the LNP cutting 47 million from homelessness services when we currently have so many homeless people?
35. You're exactly right. But this sub is a left-wing echo chamber. You will get nowhere fast stating pure facts, having common sense, or trying to have a normal conversation. Been proven time & time again they'll just lash out at you with abuse, anger & hatred.
36. You think the LNP are going increase pay and improve conditions enough to fix the shortage of new recruits / officers quitting? You'll just stop hearing about youth crime in the media. There's over 4500 vacancies for Police Australia wide, 2000 NSW, 900 QLD, 800 VIC etc. It's just not a job people want to do for the pay / conditions.
37. Worst leader our state has ever had. He's an extreme narcissist
38. It's easy to be graceful when you win lol But I do agree, it wasn't a great speech
39. Yes one speech was a lying Newman government plant and the other was a proper premier. Those who voted for the LNP are absolutely brainwashed into thinking they are some how superior and now All Queenslanders will pay the price of there stupidity.
40. Kept trying to get policies out of the LNP. They said 'nope, wait for the media blackout'. Tried to pin them down on the abortion thing. Dodged an answer on that literally ***hundreds*** of times. Tried to get a straight answer about bulk billing and immigration - it's ***all*** fear mongering and no substance. So... I gave them the opportunity to tell the truth instead of lies and they declined the offer. LNP voters did not even attempt any of this.
41. It's because all the rednecks who have 4+ children each are now voting age. They're overtaking educated people.
42. The downvotes on this comment is a barometer in how the reddit base is so different from the voting base!
43. Yup I remember working under Campbell in QLD Health. It was a shit show, LNP just spent a massive amount of money plugging staff shortages with contractors after firing people. I don't want to be in charge of regards that will kill people by accident. Good luck QLDers with the Jesus freaks. I am quitting, pulling all my super out Qsuper , investments in QLD and leaving the state.
44. Go have a swim in Brisbane River. It'll clear your head. The weather has been kinda hot after all.
45. You think Bandt‚Äôs going to lose in inner city Melbourne? HA.
46. If he was my croc, he would be a pair of boots by now...
47. Where are they getting all the extra money to build more youth detention centres if they cut coal royalties though? LNP are a bunch of lying fucking cunts, always have been and always will be.
48. The biggest issue should be the fact he is going to change preferential voting to FPP. He is going to strip the safest form of voting in the world.
49. In theory, it means jobs for longer, the mining companies make decisions based on the price of coal and how much revenue they‚Äôre making. I work at a coal adjacent company, so I‚Äôve definitely see mines where they‚Äôll close off entire sections based on profitability and reopen them later when it‚Äôs monetarily worth it so that‚Äôd affect jobs. In reality I don‚Äôt really think it much much at all, if anything they‚Äôll keep operating in the same way they have been, if the coal royalties tax goes away, they‚Äôd know it‚Äôll come back as soon as Labor is back in power so they‚Äôre probably going to just try to make as much revenue while they can. For whatever reason people seem to think they‚Äôll just pack up and go somewhere else, but the resources are where they are, if they were somewhere else they‚Äôd be there already.
50. He's the result of when someone with the iq of a cactus is still slightly smarter than the people voting for him.
51. Paid ambulance alone will fix the ambulances ramping outside the hospitals.
52. And for actually passing on extremely well considered cost of living measures which worked as intended while not fanning the inflation flames.
53. I noticed it was a big thing, you could tell people straight to there face is they thought Labor was responsible for cost of living crisis in Canada, they'd say no. And then 10 minutes later be talking about Labor and cost of living again.. Not sure what's happened, but people have turned Into the absolute dumbest of the dumb
54. how is labor not responsible for the cost of electricity in queensland? or the lack of sovereign owned mining and resource revenue like you the countries often touted who invested heavily and didnt just expect to tax their way into wealth
55. But will this mean my house will go up in value even more or nah
56. They will not be able to help themselves. I‚Äôd say they will do their worst in their first year, giving them 3 years to let people forget.
57. 4 years is a long time ...and a lot of damage...
58. You think the LNP learns from their own mistakes? The only thing they learn is how to do things quieter. Newman had the problem of chest thumping and announcing all his shit, Crisafulli will do it from 1 William St, and duck and weave when questioned on it to ensure he doesn't say anything stupid for the next 4 years to hope he can score another 4 Queensland just told the LNP "Yeah, we don't care that you have no plans, no costings, and no actual hard proof of anything you're doing, you can lead for a bit"
59. > No- one wants to be a one term government. What do they care? They can be a bull in a china shop for 4 years, make our lives miserable and gut all of our programs, then get voted out, then the weird collective amnesia that seems to fill every resident of Brisbane will kick in and we'll all vote them back in sometime in the near future for round #437 of fucking everything and everyone that isn't themselves. Then the average person will furrow their brow and ask with consternation of how did things get to this point? Completely oblivious to them constantly voting for the "we fucking hate you peasants" party time and time again.
60. On what metric are you basing this? Can the government control the cost of oil? Can the government control the cost of groceries which Coles and Woolworths are continually selling at significantly higher prices than inflation because they can? Can the government control what people spend? Can the government control China's significant economic downturn? The only area in which the government bares responsibility is housing, but I'm choosing to believe you are smart enough to know both major parties are equally culpable in that crisis. Though Labor is still objectively better in that area than the LNP despite its failings.
61. It‚Äôs smart policy and has not only educational benefits (the headlining rationale) but it‚Äôs also ethically right to make sure children aren‚Äôt hungry.
62. Surely they get free lunches in the kiddy camps right? I mean, sure, the government is assuming you're guilty of something even if you haven't offended, but you get a free meal :S
63. It won‚Äôt happen ever now. Every time Labor takes a risk on these progressive policies and lose they go into their shells. Look at shortens Labor vs albos.
64. Just another silly non-targeted inflation inducing bribe at an inappropriate time, like all his bribes. Wheeled out just before an election, when they should be fighting inflation, this man was just spending like crazy.
65. They'd be a fool not too, their were predictions that labor wouldn't even get 30 seats the fact that they might get 33-36 is a good result for them
66. Yeah I reckon they'll do schoolies first. My partner is doing the drug testing at schoolies and they're all freaking out because everything is literally planned and ready to go. But it's the easiest first thing that LNP can do to look tough on crime and youth at the same time.
67. Well in my neighborhood all the old ladies who are well past child bearing SMh
68. Agree, I‚Äôm not of childbearing age but wouldn‚Äôt vote for this idiot. We have to think about our young women and future generations. I feel sick they won.
69. Maybe they didn‚Äôt see the weeks of his slimey question dodging about the private members bill/ conscience vote and that he voted against decriminalisation and only saw the snip of him saying ‚Äúthere will be no change‚Äù at the debate. While acting like it was a scare campaign not based on reality.
70. What moron actually believed that gutter politics character assassination. Zero probability of becoming policy.
71. You are begging the question - these people don't think it's their body in question, it's the body of another human being which is just contained within theirs. Of course you won't understand their view if you inject the crux of the argument into your premise
72. The difference between paying for a driver licence or paying for a driver licence plus a little bit of profit on top for LicenceCorp
73. A private company does not have the same level of obligation to the public as the government does. The public also does not have as much sway over private companies than they do over their own government. If you feel the goverment was responsible for higher costs of living, you can vote them out. As they did here. If you feel a private company was responsible for higher costs of living, what are you gonna do about it? Vote them out? You can vote in a new government that can reign them in, but its a lot harder to take back something once you have given it away. Its a game of rock paper scissors. The public can vote out the government, the government can regulate private companies, and private companies do their best to squeeze as much profit out of the public as the government allows them to, because the public has no direct leverage over them
74. In the 1990‚Äôs, the federal government sold telecom (the precursor to Telstra). This initially lead to the development of Optus, some even competition between the two, lower prices, and the such. But then Telstra ended up with the larger market share. They had more infrastructure. Then they sent call centre jobs to ‚Äòcheaper fields‚Äô. Then they hiked the prices up. Optus followed suit. Repeat over and over, because they can. They answer to shareholders now, not the government.
75. Leads to long-term loss of skill in the public sector and an overreliance on consultants that end up costing more in the long run.
76. Example is energy infrastructure. The Government Owned Corporations like Stanwell (a generator) make decisions that aren‚Äôt always in their commercial interests, because they‚Äôre owned by the State. A private company would shut the lights off to Brisbane if it wasn‚Äôt viable to continue generating. And that‚Äôs how you get rolling blackouts
77. If you run something as a for-profit business, it's gotta generate profit in order to be viable. Many public services, like the post office, garbage pick-up, healthcare, water, gas, sewerage, and electricity network supply, they're not a profitable thing to run, the services don't benefit from being run like a business, expecting exponential financial growth out of a public service means they're going to cost more year after year, and the way to make even more money out of it is to cut quality.
78. They take state assets and turn them into to privately owned businesses. The people who own these businesses are very eager to obtain these assets, and so pay handsomely for the privilege. And while that amount may seem like a huge one, it‚Äôs a literal tiny fraction of what that state owned company would have made over the next decade. The thing is, LNP have consistently shown that they are more interested in short term decisions that line the pockets of the 1% at the expense of what would have been money coming in for the state. So for a few years things will seem to be getting cheaper, we‚Äôll be getting a few extra tax breaks and that‚Äôs good isn‚Äôt it? Sure. For the ultra wealthy. Eventually those in power will fuck off with all the money and leave the state depleted. That‚Äôs the legacy we‚Äôll be leaving for our kids. But nobody gives a fuck about that. They want the money now. For themselves. Privatisation can be a good thing for communities. But these mining royalties should be Queensland‚Äôs lifeline, and LNP have a track record of putting off hard decisions for future governments, while stuffing their pockets with cheques from privately owned mining firms.
79. Public sector is meant to do what is best for the public when providing a service. A private company does what is best for profit when providing a service.
80. Ndis has a lot of private providers. Immediately rorted every loophole they could find
81. You might enjoy reading Vulture Capitalism. It‚Äôs not an Aus perspective, but it has heaps of examples
82. The simple answer is that a private company is looking out for its ceo and shareholders only. If you think electricity in qld is expensive you just wait and see what happens when it gets privatised. At the moment it‚Äôs a huge revenue earner for the government, even with a tonne of that money being reinvested into the infrastructure and maintenance. If it gets privatised. Maybe the maintenance doesn‚Äôt need to happen as often so save a few bucks. Maybe the forward planning doesn‚Äôt happen to save a few bucks. Maybe we can let some staff go. Maybe we can lift the kWh price higher so we can get more revenue for our manager. Fast forward 10 years. Prices have steadily risen. Quality of the network has dropped. Maintenance has fallen behind and unplanned outages are increasing. All while the government has been missing out on huge revenue coming in. So you‚Äôve spent your loot, things are worse for the public. And now you‚Äôve got no chance of buying it back Oh, unless it‚Äôs like Telstra. Where they just let the infrastructure get so degraded we eventually fixed it with nbn for them.
83. Those underutilised tunnels in Brisbane are a great example. When I work at one of my client's site: $25 per day in tunnel fees.
84. Thank you for asking and wanting to learn, we need more people like you casting votes and not people who take everything at face value without thinking first!
85. Public exists to provide a service, Private exists to make money. Ideally the end result would be a better or same service without the direct cost to the government/public. Problem it is rare that it does with how greedy goblin private can get and the overall dollars saved/made in the short term loses out (often significantly) over the long term. What's likely to happen now is a further straining of public health services in particular, which won't effect the top end of town but will absolutely further the squeeze for everyone else who need or who's only choice is public.
86. No learning allowed it seems. You‚Äôve been issued downvotes. Things are very reasonable in here lol
87. This is in theory: Cons: Privatisation results in private companies effectively taking a cut from government spending. Pros: Due to a profit incentive, it incentivises said company to find more efficient ways of doing things. A good example of where Privatisation works, is where competition is strong, either naturally (like bakeries) or artificially (like QLDs CTP system which makes you select from 3 insurers in a simple drop down box, forcing them to compete on price)
88. The fact you were downvoted for asking a legitimate question says enough about Reddit.
89. Where there is real competition, privatisation works really well. This is because us consumers can choose which organisation to patronise. This incentives then to keep prices down and innovate. This will always be more efficient that any government run organisation. **HOWEVER** where there is no real competition such as electricity then privatisation doesn't achieve anything. Electricity is generated by mainly govt owned organisations which is then transmitted by Powerlink (gov owned) which is then delivered to retail distributor Energex (gov owned) which is then bought and sold by your retailers such as Origin etc. So when they privatised electricity, all they really did was privatise the customer service division of Energex. These retailers get their electricity from the same places at the prices set, they don't have a choice. There is no real competition. There is no room for innovation. The consumer doesn't have a real and meaningful choice. If anything, this is to an increase of cost to the consumer because these retailers need to turn a profit to exist.
90. Not sure if this will let me post, as I just created a throw away account. I work in a place that should be privatised in Queensland. We are sooooooooo over paid, thousands of us on between 200-350k and very little work is getting done. We are over paying contractors millions because we are so risk adverse. People in a lot of the roles don‚Äôt have qualifications either, they get in via casual roles, get made automatically permanent after 2 years, then internally employed before a role can go externally. Car park is full of 300 series land cruisers, BMW and high end cars. I do not want to privatise our sector, but honestly we could have 30% of the staff we have and do the exact same job. A few people went camping a few weeks ago and ‚Äúworked from the camp site with their families‚Äù. I am part of it and enjoy the benefits, but I have to admit I labour has let the pubic sector run wild lately. We work close with other departments and we compare stories and laugh. It‚Äôs similar across a lot of them, not all. But there is just soo much fat to cut.
91. Wishful thinking. They'll stay until "Wow Labor left things much worse than we could even imagine, we have to make cuts to pay for this reckless spending" (By reckless spending they mean lack of royalty income)
92. Don‚Äôt count on it. Crisafulli will start whinging about how the state nEeDs To BaLaNcE tHe BoOkS, and how 50c fares need to be one of the first things to go.
93. Dude, there's no way something this in the pockets of Gina the Hutt and the mineral council keep the fares. Say goodbye to nationalized petrol, school lunches, 1000 dollar energy rebates, renewable energy projects, and the 50 c fares
94. Bah they‚Äôre gone: There‚Äôs nothing the LNP loves more than cutting public services.
95. Hahaha good one‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this is overturned by end of year.
