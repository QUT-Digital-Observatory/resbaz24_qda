Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. When ever I hear 'both parties are shit' (out in the real world not on reddit) i can pretty much always guarantee that person is voting conservative. Just a little hypothesis I've been working on, still yet to find an exception to the rule. Maybe its just the people I'm around.
2. But both of the biggest parties ARE shit. There's nothing cynical about it, there are literally dozens of examples of even the better of the two being absolute fucking garbage. The difference is just the degree. Labor is absolutely shit... and LNP is 100% worse. **But being better than the worst does not make a party 'good'.** The Greens and sane independents are the only responsible first preference choices for policies which put people first and don't doom us to environmental apocalypse while siphoning public money into well-connected private purses. And that's fine to point out and doesn't 'split the vote' and all the other deceitful scumfuck desperate bullshit the ALP imports from America to try to pretend they deserve progressive votes, because we have preferential voting in this country so people can - and *should -* vote for the best candidates first, and preference 'the lesser evil' after them. There are left and right factions within the ALP and the left factions need the evidence that comes from ALP losing seats to progressives who give a shit about people like the Greens do to convince the rest of the party that more voters want progress, not to regress. There's zero signs they need to pull their fucking fingers out if they can succeed on first preference from ignorant voters who think they only have two options.
3. Isn't labour just as corrupt and petty but they're more on the side of the average Joe than business? Or is that wrong?
4. True? I thought there was only a small margin of women in power that backed them on this particular topic. But the cherry on top is that they just say no you can't and then don't help wirh the aftermath
5. Are you actually trying to wind people up or this the first time you've been on the internet? Edit: if you're actually don't know I apologise but it's fucking everywhere I just assume you were winding people up
6. The right to choose whether or not you stay pregnant. Abortion has come up again as a possible ‘conscience’ vote in the future…there has been lots of discussion on it in this sub
7. KAP have announced they WILL bring a bill in the next parliament to ban abortion. The LNP leader has been very coy about whether the party has a position or if they will allow a conscience vote as they did in 2018 which resulted in almost all LNP members wanted to keep it illegal.
8. I haven't even been able to find out what an "adult" crime is. Are we going to be easier on someone for robbing a toy store than a bottle shop?
9. The word “Food” symbolises in the context of this topic more than literal Edible food Food, Education, Community, Upbringing, Family, Role models, Stability, Opportunity etc. The fabric of a well-rounded human being.
10. He talks out of both sides of his mouth about the housing crisis, that's for sure. And there's been some under rug sweeping about his time as a police officer, definitely.
11. When you read the OP's comments though, that wasn't the intent. They wanted their opinions validated. Its disingenuous intrigue.
12. I'm confused as to why I'm getting downvoted for that comment, lol. People love to call Reddit an echo chamber, like its not blatantly obvious. We are all verrrryyyyy aware there aren't many people here who will sing his praises. If you want to find pro LNP rhetoric, Facebook is a great start. Or Crusifulli's tiktok and look for the profile names with Aussie flags.
13. Exactly what I'm after, it's good to hear informed replies to help me understand what I'm missing which I feel I've gotten some good replies from some of the people that would vote for certain policies but have changed because they strongly disagree with one thing I particular. If someone gave me hard facts that lnp were actually the good guys I'd listen but till then..
14. Absolutely. You know what. The state machine will keep running and the streets won't burn to the ground whichever party gets in. BUT, the policies, overall, of the current LNP candidacy mostly appear to be punitive and the ALP progressive. I still haven't heard a single positive and forward thinking growth policy out the LNP or any of its supporters. Not a single one.
15. No but the answer can be that some rich cunts muddy the waters intentionally for personal gain.
16. It's not though according to every metric we have available, and the LNP claims have been unamimously debunked by almost every expert there is. Do you have any evidence to back up your claims about the police pressuring individuals to drop cases? In 2022 QLD hit the lowest youth crime rates in recorded history and haven't really moved since. There ARE specific crime rates that are going up - DV and sexual assault. This is likely to be from an increase in reporting (a good thing!), but nothing to do with youth crime. While there are some small localised increases in youth crime (which are directly correlated with lower socioeconomic regions, less opportunities for diversionary programs/after school programs/similar, higher rates of alcoholism/family violence, etc), the LNP's plans don't address a single causal issue, and we know from hundreds of years of policing data that it's only going to make things worse in these areas. We -know- that more harshly policing youth is a direct cause of future offending. The only reason it's an 'issue' is because we have a media ecosystem, almost entirely LNP-aligned, who decided spread a nonexistent issue for political opportunism. There's a reason there's a direct crossover between who is spreading/repeating a lot of the bullshit at the top level, and those who are mad about stuff like, for example, a very minor tax for extractive industries. Down from this, these issues are then spread by social media pages creating boomer bait rageposts, and advocating for stuff like the community 'taking matters into their own hands'. The language used by these groups is then repeated by the LNP (such as referring to these kids as 'untouchables'; just racist dogwhistling). This is something that has been happening since the invention of policing; you can find the exact same things being said by the exact same types of people going back hundreds of years.
17. Amanda Stoker might be your answer for the rogue ultra conservative MP given she wins oodgeroo (she will)
18. Hang on. You've just said that they don't have any policies. But then you've criticised their policies. So which is it? Just because you don't like their policies doesn't mean they haven't got any.
19. Shit man are you ok? do you need a hug or something, that's kinda fucked
20. Just enjoy the democratic process and get off your high horse. There is 36 hours left, and us progressive Redditors are really just preaching to the choir - the odds are (literally) that LNP is going to win, and you’ll be happy.
21. Yep stoker will get in, she's running for the seat based in Cleveland which hasn't gone red since I've been alive. She got parachuted into pretty much the safest seat possible and I wouldn't be shocked to see her be in the cabinet straight up. Edit to correct: her seat hasn't been won by the ALP since 2006 so not quite before I was alive but a very long time ago
22. Well I think firstly not having 50c transport and school lunches for all is a given - I would hope if they do look at both of these they make them much more small target, for example, cheaper transport for pensioners and school kids, and lunches for schools in lower socioeconomic areas or lunch vouchers for specific kids. That’s more likely under the LNP, but obviously there is a risk that there’s none. You know that the LNP will kowtow to the more militant elements of the union movement less, so you should see a reigning in of some of the less reasonable union activity - Miles is a union man through and through and seems to just do what they say. With the crime thing, there is no doubt you’re going to see harsher treatment under the LNP. Now one thing that might work in everyone’s favour is that the LNP got slugged last time when they went way to far, so they might be more cautious in what they put in place this time, but I’m under no illusions that they’ll take a ‘punishment’ stance over a rehabilitation one. Your point is absolutely right, the way to deal with it more longer term is to spend time on the causes, and I have little to no faith the LNP will do that, but I do think they’ll at least put more things in place that will make it less likely that kids will be cruising Brisbane suburbs looking for cars to steal which will mean things like what happened to the Kefu family in Coorparoo will be less likely to happen. You speak to people in those areas and things like car theft and porch pirates sound like they’re happening frequently, and I have more faith that the LNP will reign it in than Labor. The Olympic stadium thing I think is simpler, the LNP literally has to be better than Labor, you would have to work to stuff it up even equally as badly.
23. I’m sorry, but, what? The stat I quoted wasn’t *stop work in qld has gone up relative to last year*, it’s *higher number than other juridictions under similar conditions* That, on the face of it, is *relatively* bad and in no way just “higher number bad”. Of course it is bad when you have been the union affiliated party in government for 8 years when the union has such little confidence the government will come to the table to solve its problems it has to strike all the time. How could the union being so unhappy with the legislative and regulatory environment after 8 years of a one house government to the tune of 4x more than elsewhere *ever* be anything other than bad??? If I had said for example that domestic violence in qld is 4x higher than other states, or crime is 4x higher than in other states (neither are the case, they are just straw man examples), would you give me a “that stat doesn’t mean anything” retort too, or is it only because you didn’t like the stat that you responded like this - genuine food for thought
24. Depending on the seat, One Nation will likely grab some rural seats so voting this way would help that along... if everyone votes the way you're suggesting it also wouldn't reach the major parties. Just do some research and vote on your preference but blindly dropping votes into the racism and fundamentalist parties is a wild way to go
25. That would not bother me at all. Qld being so decentralised has been a bad outcome for SEQ.
26. Can we even have early elections any more, with fixed terms?
27. I've had explained that it's generally applicable when: A) opposition isn't hopeless (see last time) B) government has been in for three or more terms C) there is a perception of lack of transparency of government (hiding things) - Anna wasn't great on this front, and Steven doesn't get full credit because he's only been in during election mode (and thus is trying to buy his way back in). I've heard a lot of "I need a way to punish Labor without giving the other side a majority". I think we'll see an expanded cross bench as a result - teals+greens+KAP+ONP (I have Ashby as a possible, as much as I hate it), Labor holding strong in Brisbane/Redlands/Ipswich/Logan/MBC, but LNP dominating the coasts and regional cities. That's probably enough to get LNP close to government, and it's probably bad if KAP is required to get them in vs Labor/Green/Indie.
28. I find it frustrating when peolle saybit's time for change. I might not love how things are going, but it doesn't mean I'm going to vote for a worse candidate just because Ibwant a change. I'm wondering if my car would look better in a colour other than silver, but I won't paint it dogshit brown just because I want a change for change's sake.
29. I think it’s less so that but more so people blaming labour for a lot of the worlds problems. They have the mindset of bad thing happened during labour government = must be a bad party
30. I believe DV numbers are higher than youth crime. But youth crime can be used as a scare tactic without pointing the finger at the voters themselves.
31. According to the Media, it's QLD's biggest problem ever faced. 1974 floods, that's nothing. Greatest natural disaster is the 2024 youth crime crisis!! /s
32. But the news always has segments on (youth) crime, so it must be bad. /s It's Trump's defense. They are eating the cat, they are eating the dogs. I saw it on the news.
33. I'm very aware of this.. people don't understand that it's legal to false advertise in a political campaign as it's part of parliamentary privilege. They could promise every child a place at Brisbane Grammar for free and not have to deliver nor would they get in trouble for it. Yet idiots will read it and vote for whoever said it.
34. Labors renewable investment thing has almost the majority of economic benefits going to the regions. There's hundreds of millions of dollars put aside for renewable manufacturing hubs in areas like Townsville, and almost all the infrastructure projects are happening rurally. It's expected to add $500bn to the states economy by 2050. Most of this is focused outside of Brisbane. Without this, there's almost 100k of job losses throughout the state as a lot of the mining industry wraps up (due to economic factors, nothing to do with environmental policy). Of course, the LNP disagrees with everything but net zero by 2050, and you've got influential figures screaming about how 'insane' it is that the LNP isn't pledging to dismantle all the investment immediately. Even if you don't give a shit about the environment, if you live in the regions you would be absolutely nuts to vote for the LNP. They do not give a fuck about you in any way, shape or form.
35. The fix is government funding and policies that cut red tape to increase employment opportunities. Labor have focused on Brisbane city for their tenure and it’s now time to see what happens. I personally vote independent when I agree with their policies because in the likely event of a minority government, they hold more power than the premier.
36. The way it’s reported is making it look like it’s down. The reality is police are closing cases on incidents quicker than before. Much like if you’ve ever had something stolen. Police come around, make a report, you follow up a bunch of times, they say it’s unlikely anyone will ever get caught - and from there they keep asking you if you’d like to drop it constantly so that they can report it as a non incident on their statistics. It hurts their “solved” cases numbers if not, as well as their “policing” numbers by making it look like more crime is occurring. Youth crime is an issue. Very much so.
37. It is on the downward trend because the repeat offenders that were causing a large portion of the crimes turned 18 within the last few years and are no longer dealt with under youth justice. It hasn’t been fixed, they’re just moving to the big house instead of detention centres. Do you honestly think that if the services were available that kids in high risk environments would attend voluntary appointments? There would be more no shows than attended. The fix is education and employment to stop the welfare cycle. Employed parents and kids that attend school are far less likely to commit crime. If employment opportunities in regional areas don’t improve, the crime rate will be back.
38. Actually, it's the Americans who've got the meaning of 'liberal' wrong.
39. The origin of the word? Sure. The reason we spell it like Labor is usually attributed to an American-Australian politician within the Labor party, King O'Malley
40. What have the Greens done recently that has put off the electorate?
41. Your post is like "meh whatever I don't care". If I misinterpreted that then I apologise
42. It's the difference between "doesn't meet the ideal" and "actively working against your best interests".
43. People on welfare who vote for the Liberals just blow me away.
44. Ordinarily and as a Labor voter I’d have to agree with you. There’s been very little energy from the Labour Party of recent times but then Steven stepped in and there’s a sense of promise I’ve not seen from the ALP since Goss.
45. Bang on. Exactly why this time I got off my arse and am volunteering for the greens. Our only hope of actual community representation is to support the greens so they can disrupt the status quo of the duopoly.
46. No way you just claimed Greens are sane or more sane then other parties? Have you seen some of the posts that ACT green reps having been putting out lately? Got to be some of the craziest, radical shit I've seen in a long time. Not to mention Senator Lydia Thorpe who use to be a green rep and we all know what's been happening there 😅.
47. No this is exactly what I was talking about. Masturbatory cynicism. It feels good to just say “everybody sucks, oh except this unelectable mob which means I get to forever say everybody sucks” but that doesn’t make it helpful or accurate. Both the state and federal ALP have a long list of achievements. The greens are snake oil salesmen and will never have to actually back up their claims. It’s very easy to tell people you have all the answers, and then stand on the sidelines complaining. The ALP losing votes to the greens is because they are actually pragmatic and need to win over moderates in order to achieve something. Unlike the greens who want to disenfranchise people, win them over and achieve nothing but complain, invent lies like the “gas fast track bill”, vote against their own platform, and demand the federal ALP wrangle the states on irrelevant garbage in order to pass simple legislation. They have a large amount of votes relative to the small number of seats, meaning they do not pick up preferences. People either love them or hate them, which is no way to ever win government. If they carry on as they are, they will forever be a protest party just white anting their own cause to stay relevant. This guy explains it pretty well https://www.reddit.com/r/friendlyjordies/s/sOEQ9wmCgT
48. It’s wrong. Consider this: the ALP have won 2 federal elections in 30 years. They are the underdogs at the federal level and they know it because the billion dollar media industry props up the LNP. What people call “abandoning their base” is actually just “appealing to moderates and not just the far left” because if they are just forever in opposition they might as well be the greens. The LNP get most of their funding from miners, banks, casinos etc. The ALP get considerably less from them, with a lot of it coming from unions: ie the working class.
49. They're still on the side of business more than they are average joes, but it's just different *types* of business. The things they do to genuinely improve life for the public are a fraction of what they should... but they are still, however, better than the LNP like night and day. But we have preferential voting, so it's not a binary choice and never should be viewed as one.
50. If you have at least one woman in your life that you care about you can’t vote LNP because they want to criminalise abortion again.
51. I’ve seen it posted A LOT on here, which is very left leaning…. But I’ve not seen anyone post any actual bills or legislation, or direct quotes in context saying they “want to ban abortions”. I’ve only seen Katters bill amendment to the live births from abortions….. which doesn’t say anything about banning abortions; at all. Id be super appreciative if you could post some actual legislation being proposed
52. I’m yet to see a proposed bill or statements that say anyone wants to ban abortions… that’s what I’m looking for. I’ve seen the live births bill amendment that Katter put forward but that says nothing about banning abortions.
53. Can you show me where they said that? I haven’t come across anything where Katter said he wants to outright ban abortions, just make amendment’s to the live births bill; which isn’t the same thing.
54. Perhaps, though not malicious - people find themselves accidentally engaging in confirmation bias all the time. I certainly do.
55. Could you give me an example of this please so I know where I've gone wrong or anyone that agrees with them
56. I suspect you are watching a heuristic in action. People note that you are not wholly supportive of their team, and instinctively downvote without bothering to read any further. This is why I always tend to judge my reddit views based on the written responses to my comments, not just emotive clicks of an arrow.
57. What do you think of these I listed elsewhere? \- Increased funding to early intervention residential programs and $80 million on new court-sentenced facilities for young offenders in remote areas. \- Plans to re-establish the productivity commission to conduct a regulatory review into the building industry as part of their strategy to address cost-of-living issues. \- Increased hiring of healthcare workers \- Plans for the increased construction of social housing These seem both positive and forward thinking.
58. I have no idea where you're seeing that, but Sportsbet and Ladbrokes have Labor at $8.50. I think you're looking at one particular seat betting,
59. What and they just started doing this this election cycle? Thank god they gave us a 30 year head start... I dont know what we would have done with it !!! Why is this election Labor is uniquely unpopular compared to the decades of electoral success. What has changed **this election**?
60. You cite more reporting as the apparent reason for certain crimes being up but then ignore the fact that some people might not be reporting other crimes being up because nothing is done. Do I have evidence police are pressuring people to drop cases? That’s like asking for documented examples of people not reporting crimes. It’s just difficult to prove and provide. It’s not a massive pressure thing, but police actively touch base with you to have a case closed off by a set time to not report on their file/KPIs. They have targets to hit, hence want to make their numbers look good. This is a commonly known thing. Much like any sales person or any other role with KPIs. If a case is closed by a person who reported it, it does not go into “unsolved” or “crime incidents” reports. It’s dropped from records if closed within a timeframe.
61. A handful of dot points and some media sound bites don't constitute a policy. [Labor](https://www.stevenmiles2024.com/our-work) and the [Greens](https://greens.org.au/qld/policies) actually have policies and costings that you can read on their websites. [This](https://online.lnp.org.au/therightplan), meanwhile, is the best the LNP can come up with: no costings, and half of each "policy" page dedicated to sledging Labor's "failures." If a party wants my vote, they better bloody well prove that they're ready to govern. The LNP hasn't come close to that.
62. That's a lot of words with no details on why. Sorry for being curious as to what's actually going on behind those stats.
63. One nation have one seat (Mirani) so I’m doubtful. But keep voting to keep the status quo, QLD just had its biggest coal boom since the mining boom and it was squandered so I can’t see either party improving QLD now coal prices have crashed and the high royalty percentages over the last couple years don’t apply to the now lower price.
64. And north Qld, I respect Katter but absolutely disagree with his views on family, women ECT...
65. I think you can still have them when a budget can't pass
66. 0% chance. At most you'll see an agreement for supply. Few parties hate the greens more than labor
67. Let me honest it'd be cream at best, not much will chance either way, but they'll spend billions to do it!
68. Conflating Federal and State parties is always a problem. They should rebrand to QLP and see if that helps people see the difference.
69. Oh yeah dv callouts are at the top of the list for police .
70. More DV call-outs isn’t always a sign that DV is on the rise. It could be that all the recent DV awareness campaigns have had an effect and it’s being better reported to police now. But police definitely need more resources to adequately deal with DV either way. As too many other support agencies.
