Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. Yes, and you’ll know that the legality relied on “risk to a woman’s health” which is extremely open to interpretation in many cases. Again it’s good you got the care you need but don’t use that to discourage others from protecting important laws.
2. Sounds like your experience mostly revolves around Brisbane? Outside of Brisbane access was and still is hard. It's been improved incredibly by the change in legislation, including public hospitals being compelled to provide pathways to abortion. You are speaking entirely from your experience, and saying it "didn't seem like" when there is literally evidence to the contrary you could find with a single google search. Presenting the situation as less bad than it is/was is not at all helpful, and gives people the wrong impression.
3. Non-enforcement of criminal penalties is not the same as not illegal. Abortion was illegal in Queensland prior to 2018, and abortion clinics were raided by police in the 1980s in accordance with laws at the time.
4. Fucking Christ you’re dumb mate. You know what an example is don’t you? I just went with the first two that I thought of. I don’t support either of them and you’d have to be fucking brain dead to think I did. The reason I said them is a) because they’re the first ones I thought of and b) they’re on complete opposite ends of the spectrum. I did that so no one could point and shout that I’m biased but somehow stupid has managed to do it anyway. Go grow a brain you fucking tool
5. The fact that you think you know better than medical professionals who actually perform reproductive care for actual pregnant women is extremely telling. "I feel this way about a topic, so facts be damned, I'm right and everyone else is wrong". You're too much of a dumbass to know you're a dumbass. I have nothing else to say to you.
6. There are NO viable babies dying outside of the womb FFS. 1% of abortions occur after 22 weeks, and they are for fetal abnormalities. a 'healthy' baby induced to die on the table after 22 weeks would be (while technically legal and possible) incredibly rare indeed.
7. I'm not blaming anyone unfortunately as long as the QLD LNP don't remove the two Pumped hydro projects and simply commit funding to them everything will be fine. We need those hydro projects to replace the Aging coal infrastructure which is rapidly approaching EOL.
8. > he’s going to renege and ban abortion in legislation? are you ok? you clearly do not understand what the question is? he is being asked if he would allow a conscious vote which he refused to answer. you are asking if he is going to ban abortion himself. those are different things?
9. Yeah, would be impossible for him to inform the public through a clear statement without being asked. And he's been asked over 100 times about a conscience vote. He hasn't answered it directly yet. Instead he avoids questions about conscience votes with "not in our plan" or "\*I\* believe in a woman's right to choose" never providing direct information about what he will do would KAP introduce the Bill. Politically, the easiest way to deal with it is to allow a conscience vote. If he shuts down his white christian nationalist MPs (which is the majority of them), then he risks losing control of the party room. If he puts it to a conscience vote, he will be able to appease them AND argue that it wasn't LNP policy, creating arms length from the laws. There is no reason I've seen as to why the LNP members wont vote differently than what they did in 2018.
10. Certainly do. You don't make votes based on promises. Just like you never buy a product based on what it could be in the future. Same principle
11. Thank you but I was lucky I had a supportive partner who could pay all my bills and a workplace who didn’t give me grief for being off sick. That doesn’t normally happen for most women hence why they make these heartbreaking decisions. I once had a a&e nurse say just get an abortion if you’re that sick because I dared to ask for more fluids ( my bloods came back and showed I needed fluids but that’s what I up against) plus I was a skeleton. Yes, there should be more support but there is absolutely none therefore women will need to terminate for these reasons. Daily women terminate on the HG fb group and are so heartbroken as these babies are wanted but no help available. As a 31 year old woman, who works with women ( nurse ) only time I’ve had friends who have had abortions is because the man basically forces them too ( says they will ruin their lives and beg them not to keep it ) Or due to a miscarriage.
12. You stench of jealousy. Tell me, after you and your friends all cum on the cookie, do you volunteer to eat it?
13. Ok I’ll do the hard work for you, ya lazy fuck. A foetus doesn’t have human rights. Humans have human rights because, we are human beings. A foetus is not a human being, unless the host allows it to become one. If I don’t consent to a foetus using my body then I am allowed to defend myself to terminate the unwanted pregnancy. Don’t tell me I have to teach you about consent too?
14. Lmao go back to posting about dragons on the Wings of Fire subreddit.
15. i know you were. do you also find it horrific when healthy pregnancies are aborted?
16. Humans are not fully formed until they finish puberty. You are not being for real. You do not care about healthy babies, so don't pretend to care about sick babies.
17. I’m not discouraging. I just think it’s disingenuous for people to say LNP wants to make abortion ‘illegal again’ as if nobody could access care before when they absolutely could.
18. Rural access is an issue in every state because there aren’t resources to have surgeries everywhere. That’s not a QLD issue. I worked for RFDS in remote NSW & we literally had to fly women to Sydney for abortions. That’s nothing to do with legislation. I’m glad access has been improved with referral pathways.
19. ‘Mate’, you just proved you know nothing about politics with a couple comments. But I do enjoy that you keep digging. Go join Jono with his outrageous claims or find another minority to blame for your problems with Pauline.
20. Doesn’t blame anyone… next half sentence hypothetical blames the LNP for something that hasn’t even occurred yet. Nice.
21. Can you read? Apologies if English is your second language, but this is fairly clear: “Those laws will not change, my team has backed in that position,” he said.
22. Can you read? Apologies if English is your second language, but this is fairly clear: “Those laws will not change, my team has backed in that position,” he said.
23. Mustn’t be a fan of the stock market then. Or investing in general. But back to policy, guess you aren’t a fan of any project or initiatives as well. Let’s not buy into building more schools, hospitals, infrastructure either, based on the fact that you don’t buy a product based on what it could be able to achieve in the future. Interesting train of thought.
24. Sorry Ivy at first I thought you were just a Labor stooge I didn’t realize you were an actual crazy person. Same same
25. Riiiiiiiight. Whatever you have to tell yourself to cope with killing your babies.
26. I think he is just trolling; no one could be that in love with wanting an unstable world.
27. because, no abortion will be carried out at that stage unless the fetus has an abnormality that makes it incompatible with life. They could add the wording into the legislation if they wanted to, but it is completely unnecessary.
28. abortions after 20weeks make up 1% of abortions, they are done for medical reasons. nobody is carrying a healthy baby for five months, then being medically induced to give birth. You’re not pro-life you’re pro forced birth.
29. If a pregnant person does not want to have a baby, healthy or not, then they should not be forced to carry and birth that baby.
30. Pro-choice does not always equal pro-abortion. Pro-choice recognises that a person should have legal access to an abortion for any reason. That reason is irrelevant to anyone but the pregnant person. Female bodily autonomy should never have become a political agenda. You know what else prevents abortion? Vasectomies. Vasectomies can be reversed and they have little side-effect when compared to the contraceptive pill. Maybe we should bring statutory vasectomies for males of reproductive age to the political table.
31. Nope, doesn't bother me at all. Very happy to see other women taking control of their reproductive health instead of suffering through an unwanted pregnancy!
32. I absolutely care about healthy babies- I want every baby to be born to parents who want to have a child and are ready to properly care for them. *You* are the one who doesn't actually give a shit about the well-being of these hypothetical 'healthy babies'; once they're born you couldn't care less about what happens to them. *You* want their mothers to be forced to carry them to term & birth them, regardless of risk to their mental and physical health. Even a healthy baby is at risk of abuse if the mother is suffering from PPD/PPP, and unwanted babies are much more likely to be victims of abuse and infanticide. *You* want these babies to suffer through the trauma of enduring the foster care/adoption system. It's incredibly difficult and expensive to be approved for adoption in Australia, and the demand is low. Once the baby is a few years old, the chance of adoption drops drastically. *You* want these babies to grow up knowing they were unwanted by their birth parents and their mothers were forced to carry them to term. I'd encourage you to read a bit about adoption trauma and why many adoptees are staunchly opposed to the practice. Get the fuck off your 'i care about babies' high horse. Your beliefs are completely antithetical to what you claim to care about- the wellbeing of babies is (shockingly!) heavily dependent on the wellbeing of their mothers. Women do not have an obligation to incubate whatever stray embryo lodges in their uterus, and it's really as simple as that.
33. Access was pretty limited in some regional areas (to be honest still is in many places), and people had to travel interstate in some circumstances, for example later term procedures. And basically zero procedures done in public hospitals because doctors just didn’t want to do it and people paying 100s or 1000s out of pocket to access the procedure privately as the only option. Some of these things are still issues. It’s an aspect of healthcare that simply doesn’t need any more barriers. It’s not disingenuous to say they want to criminalise abortion because they definitely do. Adding abortion back into the criminal code would also send a very strong chilling message to doctors and health care workers that this is once again off the table. As opposed to putting up with an outdated law that was still hanging around and causing issues. Dig into the background of some of the newly elected LNP MPs and you’ll find some fairly strong anti abortion views.
34. With the price of going to a GP and the price for things like ultrasounds which are things you had to get prior to the decriminalisation of course there are people who would prefer not to do that with the cost of living.
35. Mate, it has everything to do with legislation. If it is already onerous for doctors to legally perform abortions because of backwards legislation, then the only doctor in a small town is not going to jump through those hoops. If they don't need to because it is legislated and there are clear guidelines, then abortions become easier to perform and therefore easier to access. You are still conflating your personal experience which is not reflective of the available evidence.
36. Jesus fucking Christ stfu. I AM a fucking minority. I’m Latino. I’m done arguing with you. You’re too stupid to reason with. Either that or you’re purposely being contrarian and rage baiting. Get a life dude.
37. Well its within there "plan" which is mostly budget cuts and destroying the public service again. Here is a [source ](https://southburnett.com.au/news2/2024/06/13/lnp-looks-at-smaller-pumped-hydro/)behind its in there plan for others who might not know. "*The LNP will investigate opportunities for smaller, more manageable pumped hydro projects.*" Which pretty much means, We are going to keep operating coal and gas generators.
38. So once again mate, try rubbing those 2 braincells together and think about why he refused to answer the question about a conscious vote, do you know what a conscious vote even is?
39. Wait, I’ve heard this before. “Now, now, don’t you worry about that!”
40. Big fan of investing, actually. Not all investment is a gamble, y'know. What? You're confusing yourself trying to disagree. Building schools, hospitals, and infrastructure is tangible, and will objectively do good if they are utilised, which they obviously will be, because the government doesn't exactly want to waste its money on building something and then leaving it to rot. Duh. Pretty fantastic train of thought, actually, but I'm curious as to how you try to disagree.
41. I’ve never even had an abortion bro 💀 I think I actually might have educated you even a little bit though cos you didn’t have a good come back
42. Your avatar looks like shit and your art sucks. Is that your answer?
43. I'm not going to argue you. You're wrong and maybe should go back to talking about Roblox instead.
44. i was asking about all healthy pregnancies. you don't wanna answer...
45. The word "if" is doing an awful lot in that sentence. "If" a mother wants to kill her chid, she should be allowed to? That is insane, how could you say such vile nonsense? Why would any mother want to do such a thing? Try putting force into this subject in an honest way. If a mother wants to force her baby to die in the womb, she should be allowed to... right? No, that's absolutely ludicrous.
46. >Pro-choice does not always equal pro-abortion. Yes, it does. The choice in question is abortion. Trying to reframe abortion as an issue of personal freedom is profoundly dishonest. >Female bodily autonomy Baby body survival. Stop being dishonest.
47. >Very happy to see other women taking control of their reproductive health instead of suffering through an unwanted pregnancy! "Very happy to see other women killing their babies instead of becoming mothers!" Why can't you pro-abortion people ever, ever, ever say things directly? Why would any sane person be happy that mothers don't want their own children? It's like a cult of infanticide at this point, you guys just spout the most vile things like you're ordering ice cream.
48. >I absolutely care about healthy babies- I want every baby to be born to parents who want to have a child and are ready to properly care for them. Yes, that sounds ideal. However, the fact that you think that it is an option to kill a healthy baby puts the lie to that statement. >You are the one who doesn't actually give a shit about the well-being of these hypothetical 'healthy babies'; once they're born you couldn't care less about what happens to them. I don't want people to be killed in any stage of their life, only insane and sadistic people champion that; so, pro-abortion, pro-war, serial killers, these kinds of people. >You want their mothers to be forced to carry them to term & birth them, regardless of risk to their mental and physical health. Lie. We are talking about healthy pregnancies conceived consensually. Rape and medical issue pregnancies are different. >Even a healthy baby is at risk of abuse if the mother is suffering from PPD/PPP, and unwanted babies are much more likely to be victims of abuse and infanticide. Abortion of a healthy baby is infanticide, you're drowning in cognitive dissonance. >Get the fuck off your 'i care about babies' high horse. Until you are prepared to condemn the killing of healthy consensually conceived babies, you are a creature without morals, with no right to speak on anything, to anyone. There is nothing lower than infanticidal people, they are on the same level as paedophiles and soldiers. >Women do not have an obligation to incubate whatever stray embryo lodges in their uterus, and it's really as simple as that. Again with the medical language to hide the truth of what is occurring. Pregnancy is not the incubation of a stray embryo lodged in the uterus. Look at those terms. * incubate * stray * lodged * embryo * uterus You're doing everything you can to hide the humanity of the baby, while still using "women". If you're going to refer to pregnancy with a list of words like that, then surely you should be referring to women as: * biped * homosapien * organism * female Or whatever other dehumanising language you can think of. Be consistent. If you want to say incubate and stray lodged embro, then say female biped. If you want to say woman, then say baby and pregnancy. You can't have it both ways. Do people have an obligation to their own children? Well, I guess that depends if they want to survive. It's like asking if people have an obligation to eat, sleep, stay warm... only if they want to be alive, I suppose.
49. Sure but it would be a pointless bill then because who is it aimed at? Failed abortions don’t exist. Babies before 22 weeks are not viable.
50. You still have to get an ultrasound for a D&C. That’s got nothing to do with the decriminalisation. The doctors have to confirm what they’re doing. You still have to get a medical abortion drug through your doctor now. You can’t just have people ordering random drugs for themselves.
51. Heart surgery is also legal everywhere. Doesn’t mean there is anyone able to do it in every rural town. Access to all sorts of medical care is an issue everywhere rural. I would say the most D&Cs are done in Brisbane because that’s where the women’s hospital is. It’s unfortunate people have to travel but that’s just Australia.
52. Do you even know what: “Those laws will not change” means? What does that sentence mean to you? If I have 2 brain cells, God forbid the 1/8th of one you have.
53. All those things are buying products based on what it could be in the future……. But then again the fact that you think some investments aren’t a gamble, kind of shows the state your head is at. Heck even putting it in a bank is a gamble. There’s no assurance that you will definitely get said money back you’ve put in.
54. Just not sure how you knew my pet name for your mum is the cookie
55. Why is a foetus not a human being though? When does a foetus become a human being to you? As soon as it is outside the womb? To me, a foetus is just a human being that is growing inside the mother, waiting to be born.
56. and? born alive does NOT mean born viable. and again, 1% of abortions are performed after 22 weeks. sadly, there are some abnormalities that are just not detectable until that late. the 'procedure' in those tragic cases is to induce birth and then provide comfort until the fetus passes. These are not viable babies being aborted, and to present it as such is an outright lie.
57. That proves absolutely nothing about what is being discussed lol. They are born alive, but are NOT viable for life, meaning they either will die regardless or be in a hospital the rest of their life. That is the only circumstance in which an abortion can be had after 22 weeks anyway, and current practices are that babies that may be viable for life are worth saving. This means the bill is useless. Doctors already give care to failed abortions that may have a chance of living. Now they want them to give care for babies that will die anyway without a chance of living.
58. in the very very rare cases where a healthy baby will be aborted after the 20week mark it will be because of reasons such as being unable to access abortion care, DFV, substance abuse issues ect NOT CHANGE OF MIND. in these cases the baby will still not be viable outside the womb, the baby will still die once induced and attempting cpr is still insane. i would rather women who are unable to carry and care for babies to not be forced to have them. i do not want to see a rise in DV or infant neglect. it’s insanely cruel you would rather children suffer once they are born and able to feel pain and suffering, to families who can’t care for them. Regardless this is such a small percentage of abortions and is a strawman argument, passing this bill will make it significantly harder for women who medically need second trimester abortions to get them, and will significantly reduce the places you can get them. bills like this also place unnecessary scrutiny on women who have had miscarriages, just look at the USA.
59. Well, "if" a mother realises she has an ectopic pregnancy, they might decide to have it removed (an abortion) so they live. That mother doesn't necessarily want to kill that unborn child, that unborn child may have been very wanted, but the mother might decide they want to live for the other children they have. "If" a mother decides that they are not fit to be a mother, for many reasons, and the pregnancy wasn't planned, they may decide it is better to end the pregnancy. "If" a 13 year old girl is raped by her father, she mat decide she wants an abortion so she has no connection to the man her broke her. Aside from bringing vasectomies back to the table, we can also discuss just how difficult it is to adopt within Australia, and how expensive it is to adopt from outside of Australia. Maybe "if" that was easier, people would choose that option first.
60. They are not babies, they are cells! And we are not incubators. You obviously know nothing about pregnancies or fetus development, so stop starting arguments, and go educate yourself.
61. Look, take babies out of it for a moment. It's a very emotive subject because babies are cute and tiny and helpless. Imagine I need a kidney. Well, not just any kidney, I need YOUR kidney. And also half of your liver. Without it, I'll die. You'll probably survive the organ donation, although to be honest, there are going to be a lot of side effects for you. Some of them will be temporary, but some of them will be permanent. And while we're both recovering, it will be your job to take care of me. You'll actually get in a lot of trouble if I die, but don't worry - no one cares if you get hurt from caring for me. And what I'm describing here is the best possible outcome scenario. I know that might not sound very fair, but the bad news is, the government has decided that because you took the risk of having a functioning kidney and liver - you are mandated by law to donate them to me now. But that's not what happens, is it? Because you can not force another person to use their body to keep someone else alive in any other situation than a pregnant woman. It would be unconscionable to make laws that said you can.
62. What about medical abortions? What about abortions where the mother would die without one? What about abortions where mother and foetus would die without one? Baby body survival - unfortunately the unborn baby is likely to have more rights than a living person if we go the way of America. Again, let's bring vasectomies to the table.
63. Pro-choice is about bodily autonomy and acknowledging that no one has the right to dictate what an adult can or cannot do in regard to their body.
64. I don’t know if you read my comment but I said with the cost of living people can’t afford that and they are resorting to things such as buying medication online.
65. Heart surgery is a really stupid comparison to an abortion, which is a relatively straightforward procedure that could be easily performed in almost any regional clinic or hospital. that is just such a ridiculous comparison to make, I don't think we're chatting in good faith anymore so I'm out. Thanks for the chat!
66. Funny how LNP voters act like the scum they vote for, impressive how well you manage to dodge questions just like the fooli. once again, why didn't he answer the question about a conscious vote. why can't you even talk about it? pretty funny, it's like being allergic or something.
