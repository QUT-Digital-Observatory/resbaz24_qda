Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Knowing he ingested all that lead from Mt Isa explains a fair bit.
2. The public service needs a reform.. Labor is gone, time to sort out
3. Turns out vitriol and smartarse memes on reddit don't affect voters.
4. Unfortunatley the brain cells start to dry up past bundaberg. Maybe thats being too generous. QLD would be better off splitting into two states. That way you could let the idiots fend for themselves. Im sure they would probably prefer it that way tbh.
5. Less efficient, more expensive and irredeemably privatised It's the liberal way.
6. Do you mean you want it gutted and sold to private offshore non australian entities and LNP buddies so that all queenslanders can enjoy the benifits of whats left of all their services sky rocketing in prices?
7. You’ve just outed yourself as the idiot mate. Look how many seats around Brisbane went LNP.
8. I live in Keppel and voted for Brittany. Rocky has historically always been Labor until just recently. That change has nothing to do with us, it's to do with wealthy retirees coming up from down south. Fling shit in that direction, mate.
9. weirdos like you can enjoy 4 years of crime and rising prices
10. I think your wrong LNP just announced there would be culling in the Public Sector… so much for for bullshit Labor spin
11. Get off the meth champ, and have a sit down
12. I don’t live in QLD, so I get to laugh at you with no consequences either way. Your complete anguish after weeks of foaming mouth obsessing is just so god damn satisfying.
13. This just in: litifeta thinks the majority of QLD voters are pedophiles. Makes me think someone should check your hard drive bro Edit: oh man look at your activity, feverishly posting about Labour and Harris. This is gonna be a bad few weeks for you lol
14. minds as bright as a dark room LNP supporters have "anyone who disagrees with me does meth," maybe put down your bottle, mate.
15. It's probably projection. This fuckwit is going around accusing everyone of being on meth.
16. Compulsory preferential voting means every vote counts in the end. Your vote may end up going to your 5th preference, but your 5th preference is obviously better than your 7th. Optional means that if none of your choices end up in the final 2 candidates, your vote is essentially useless. If you advocate for optional preferential voting when we already have compulsory, you're actively trying to make the system less fair by completely ignoring a huge number of people's votes.
17. The only people who don’t like preferential voting are the two major parties. Preferential voting is a much better way to actually have political power as a voter. The party in power knows what its support base cares about. We can all look at examples of non-mandatory non preferential 2 party systems and I don’t think anyone wants that here… except the rich people who profit off us.
18. Can somebody explain to me why OPV is more likely to benefit the LNP than Labor in Queensland? As I understand it, it benefits parties who don't have a close ally. Conservative voices often cite Greens votes as flowing to Labor as an example. But over the last few elections there's been a proliferation of right/authoritarian parties (One Nation, (Palmer) United Australia, Katter, Family First) who seem to attract voters who would preference LNP over Labor. I understand how at a population level it tends to benefit the two major parties, but in the specific example of Queensland it seems to me that it would preference Labor.
19. Crisafulli and the LNP have again imported US politics by claiming CPV is “corrupt.” Everyone assumes they will change it to OPV, but the signs are hiding in plain sight. The LNP will implement FPTP in QLD.
20. "Just vote 1" with optional preferential voting is how Newman won 88% of the seats with 49.7% of the vote.
21. I pointed this out ages ago when he brought the subject up. I claimed he was making moves toward First Past The Post voting and was howled down. Nice to see someone else has come to the same conclusion I had.
22. It’s not “rigging” you’re just being ridiculous. Any party that comes out on top with preferential voting will support it. And any party that is disadvantaged by it will oppose it. Labor used to be against preferential voting when it hurt them. Mandatory preferential voting is better, but optional preferential voting is still good. Both are far better than first past the post.
23. Do people deliberately ignore history or are they just uneducated on social media? QLD had OPV for decades. It was introduced by the Goss Labor Government after it was recommended as part of the corruption commissions. Both parties campaigned just Vote 1, with Peter Beattie (Labor Premier) pushing it as hard as possible to split the Libs/Nat vote. During Palasczuk’s reign, Labor slipped an amendment into another vote to return to CPV without ever mentioning it to anyone. The reason they did this is with the formation of the LNP, there was no longer an incentive for Labor as they couldn’t split the LNP vote. The only ones playing dodgy games here was Labor. So let’s stop talking about importing this & that - we had it already. At least the LNP have come out & said they’re doing it before the election….allows people to have their say, unlike when Labor did it under the cover of night.
24. He doesn’t want to be another Borbidge or Newman, he wants to be the next Joh.
25. Yep. The LNP are fascist scum! Put them dead last people. They belong in the trash forever and always
26. Yeah, this election is about so much more than just restricting women's rights.. I don't care about this shit right now. Vote as if your life depended on it, like the people you care about are actually doing
27. Optional preferences mean lower informal voting, especially for less-educated voters, particularly indigenous (this was seen in the NT when they switched to optional in 2016), so whether one is more democratic than the other is up for debate. Also, Queensland and NSW only adopted optional preferential because Labor wanted to screw the coalition when One Nation came along. Now the boot's on the other foot and the Greens are splitting the left vote, so Labor now wants compulsory preferences. Like, sure this change will benefit the LNP but it's undoing a change introduced purely to benefit Labor so I'm not sure anyone can get too high and mighty about it. Democracy doesn't come into it.
28. Typical right-wing strategy; if they can't win fairly based on their policy positions, call the system corrupt and then cheat.
29. In my electorate there were 7 candidates 5 of which are supporting the lnp so there's no chance of getting ridd of preferential voting
30. FFS. You aren't serious. 1) Crisafulli isn't that smart. 2) QLD already had preferential voting previously. It favours the party that isn't going to get preferences their way. The Beattie government campaigned heavily on "Just vote 1" for years before the Nationals and Liberals became the LNP and could preference each other. 3) The ALP moved to preferential only voting once they had the Greens handing them preferences and the Nats and Libs merged to become the LNP and couldn't preference each other. Each party is going to back the system that favours them at the time, and will try to change it when it suits them. This is obvious, not news the people need to be warned about. It isn't some mastermind conspiracy.
31. >his proposal to import this to Queensland Not entirely true. We had optional preferential voting in Qld until Palasczuk changed it a few terms ago so she could hold on to power for a bit longer
32. Excellent. If Reddit is any indication, the radical left in Queensland are already disproportionately powerful. Ordinary people in Queensland deserve fair representation, and optimal preferential voting is a great way to reduce informal votes.
33. This election was never about abortion. The Katters brought it up & Giggles jumped on a non issue to try to save himself. The voting system IS corrupt and ridding us of preferential voting might JUST allow the silent majority to have a say against the increasingly screaming radical minorities. I absolutely resent having to place a number, even the last number, for the idiotic Greens & Labor.
34. Optional preferential voting is theoretically as fair as compulsory preferential voting, but in practice real voters won't express preferences when they probably should. If someone doesn't preference every candidate they are essentially saying that they are equally unhappy with all remaining candidates, in which case they wouldn't care that their vote had been exhausted. If the race came down to looney independent A and looney independent B, and I know nothing about either of them, then I don't care which wins and it's a good argument for me not needing to preference between them. The problem is that in reality optional preference voting will cause people with genuine preferences (e.g. Greens voters who prefer Labor over LNP) to not fully express them, maybe out of misguided principles and an incomplete understanding of how the system works. A Greens voter should probably be preferencing the LNP over ONP, but they may dislike both parties so much that they refuse to number either box. This is a failure of the optional preferential system because a voter's true preferences have not been expressed at the ballot box. Ultimately the LNP will benefit the most from optional preferencing and their support of it is a cynical ploy to try to reduce the number of preference flows from the Greens to Labor.
35. Didn't Labor make it compulsory preferential opposed to optional? How does that imply Labor 'don't like it's?
36. They aren't arguing for a non-preferential system. They're proposing that we revert back to the system enjoyed by the Goss, Beattie and Bligh governments where people could choose to place preferences or not.
37. No one is advocating for non-mandatory non preferential voting implying that is blatant scare mongering. I like the idea of what is being proposed because hypothetically if I was only happy with greens or Labor then I could vote 1 & 2 accordingly and my vote would exhaust if neither was successful rather than going to any other party I may not ordinarily vote for given the choice. I still have to vote and there is absolutely nothing stopping me preferencing all candidates if I choose to do so.
38. Because contrary to what you assume, political parties and their policies are wide and diverse. The KAP doesn't cooperate with the LNP as much as you think it does for example - this whole abortion debacle that has really blown up for Crisafulli was their doing and clearly an attempt to steal their voter base. The economic policies of the KAP also can largely be seen to overlap with both Labor and the Nationals despite being socially Conservative and Traditionalists. OPV results in a vote being wasted if preferences aren't met and if enough votes get wasted, the pool of total votes shrinks and it defaults to FPTP, meaning the votes you do secure take a larger proportion of the total *remaining* pool. This is how Newman got 88% of seats with less than 50% of the popular vote. Also; Labor benefits from the flow on of preference votes from Greens voters - about 80% of votes for The Greens on the Federal level for example flow on to Labor. If Greens voters just voted 1 for Greens and that's it, Labor's vote count would be devastated. The Coalition does not benefit from flow on preference votes in the same way because social Conservatives tend to be extremely diverse in economic policies. But you won't catch progressives remotely EVER putting money over people's social freedoms. Optional preferential voting kills the potential of a minority government and discourages voting for a minor third party because of the very high likelihood of your vote being wasted - it becomes safer to vote for a major party instead. This is better for the Coalition because Conservative voices are more diverse and bitterly divided. Palasczuk implemented compulsory preferential voting whilst in a minority government and ended up becoming a comfortable majority government in the 2017 election as a result. This article explains why the Coalition pieces OPV well: https://theconversation.com/heres-why-the-coalition-favours-optional-preferential-voting-it-would-devastate-labor-155640
39. One Nation, United, FF, and Katter represent the interests of the elite and the powerful. If Gina tells them to disappear because it is inconvenient to her they just do it. Its like how the Brexit party in the UK didn't run against any conservatives in FPTP and then magically vanished. The only reason Farage came in was because the Conservatives were so unpopular that they had to pretend that their movement wasn't just selling out, and farage has constantly said he is open to just merge with the conservatives, just like the Nationals in Queensland did long ago. The Greens and Teals are about viewpoints that clash with the more conservative values of Labor and can't just be "ordered to move out"
40. They’ve clearly outlined the plan - it’s to return to the 2016 rules that Labor smashed through one night without ever raising it before…
41. Playing by the rules Labor set for him though wasn’t he as they were the ones that brought in OPV…?
42. I care more about policy than politics. This change is bad for our democracy.
43. Yup. Newman was incredibly stupid and invited the washout of his party at the next state election
44. “The radical left” you talk about are just ordinary people who are trying their best but are sick of the a handful of old white dudes (and Gina) get exponentially richer while our grocery bills and rent just keep going up but our wages don’t match. Ignore the media and talk to the person.. you’ll see we have a lot more in common then devices us ✌🏽
45. Lmao you’re basing Queensland’s leftness on Reddit? Fuck outta here. What would be excellent is if conservatives would fuck off back under the rock from which they came and stop destroying or threatening to destroy everything decent. Imagine how fantastic society would be if we weren’t dragged backwards by religious and racist conservatives.
46. Genuinely think this may backfire at the next election on the LNP, though it depends on how large their majority is tomorrow. If they have to govern pretty moderately (which I expect they may have to), they are extremely vulnerable to KAP, One Nation and other right-wing offshoot votes exhausting at the next election and not preferencing an LNP who they have turned on. In contrast, ALP and Greens voters are typically far more disciplined when preferencing each other under OPV systems, especially when united against a common foe. I think the LNP are fighting yesterday's war on this and are bizarrely going to weaken their own chances at the next election. A lot of this is probably based on their success at BCC level, where Greens and ALP votes do exhaust at a much higher level than in state/federal politics. This is a misreading of the LNP's success at council elections, which owes as much to people just not being as engaged/partisan when thinking about their bin collection and other basic services as it does the OPV system.
47. Labor can’t win without the Greens so I hope they do abolish preferential.
48. > silent majority to have a say against the increasingly screaming radical minorities I don't think I've met anyone as outspoken, opinionated, and judgemental, and stuck on extreme right wing talking points as you seem to be and I've met a lot of people. Even though many of the positions you spruik don't make sense or are based on any solid real world evidence. Honestly someone like you really helps confirms horseshoe theory may be a thing. I don't really care for ideas by the extreme left but you seem to sit way more right of the overton window for where Australian politics seem to stand. > The voting system IS corrupt What are you talking about we have one of the least corrupt systems in the world. > I absolutely resent having to place a number, even the last number It really doesn't make any logical sense to feel this way. I wonder how you manage to get through life without being triggered by any little inconvenience.
49. What radical minorities are you talking about? Women and LGBQTI + people?
50. No, ridding of the preferential system just results in the majority of votes being wasted. It's a terrible idea and the reason why the USA only has Republican and Democrat congressmen.
51. I wouldn't mind optional preferencial if political parties couldn't encourage voters to exhaust their preferences.
52. I don’t know the history of preferential voting policy. I know the larger the party the less they have to gain from preferential voting. But Labor (under Miles) seem less interested in political gain than they are community improvement
53. Yeah, but that was after making it optional. Labor has also flip-flopped on this. If the major parties are up two party preferred, they want optional preferential because it basically eliminates the risk of being in minority government. They only want compulsory preferential when they need preferences or at risk of becoming the opposition but might be able to jag a minority government.
54. Changing voting systems from election to election disproportionally impacts people who don’t have good English reading/comprehension skills. Additionally, non mandatory preferential voting overwhelmingly benefits those who already hold the majority of power (the two major parties)
55. All Labor Premiers, so they can’t blame the LNP for that.
56. That makes the voting system much more confusing and will lead to more votes being invalidated (from people with limited English language skills) The only people who would want this are those who already have power because it gives them more power.
57. Yep, totally agree. I’m in this situation today. In my electorate my options are ALP, LNP, Greens and One Nation. Based on all the shenanigans I don’t want to vote for LNP. Greens are too extreme for me, and One Nation still has the racist vibes. So really I just want to cast a vote for ALP and be done with it, to me the other three are equally bad. Why am I forced to rank them? Do I bring a dice to the ballot box?
58. Lmao, The Katters aren't the elite and powerful, they are an extremely pro union party that's anti privatisation and pro nationalisation. Bob Katter himself has been a CFMEU member since the 50s. They're successful in their electorates because their a more conservative labour party and able to flip generationally old labour seats.
59. Crisafulli has been vague throughout the whole election campaign - "Not my Plan." CPV, OPV, FPTP, who knows what his plan is if he becomes Premier and can't hide behind scripted lines.
60. Possibly, but if they take it to the election as a policy & they get elected, doesn’t that indicate the population prefers this model? I’d suggest most people don’t vote on only single issues, but if it was such a terrible thing for our democracy people would be forced to vote for someone else wouldn’t they..
61. Except Labor have won 11 out of the last 12 elections comfortably without much help from Greens and this election all the Greens are doing is taking seats away from Labor
62. Lol. You know the greens don't have a say in where their preferences flow? You know that Labor are the reason they don't have a say?
63. I think Greens should be removed from ballot. No one votes Greens anymore everyone knows they don’t give frig about the environment and are the most nasty,racist and divisive bunch of box ticking fascists we have ever seen in Australia.
64. The other thing is Labor would lose out on potential greens preferences in an optional preference system where as because the LNP is one party they have no such issue. Thus in seat with a large greens vote it may cause a spoiler and make it so that Libs win with less than half the vote
65. It was introduced by the nationals because right wing parties kept spoilering each other and Labour's caucus solidarity made those even more painful.
66. It was introduced by the nationals because right wing parties kept spoilering each other and Labour's caucus solidarity made those even more painful.
67. In the past Labor loved it - would split the Liberals/Nats vote. Once LNP was formed they didn’t like it as it no longer favoured them, so they got rid of it. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-21/compulsory-prefential-voting-returns-qld-parliament-passes-bill/7348172
68. Are they actually equally bad though? If the Labor and Greens candidates dropped out and it was a race between One Nation and the LNP would you donkey vote? If not you should number the boxes to express those preferences.
69. Because the different parties have wildly different ideologies and policies that you'll react differently to if they hold power and influence.
70. Heaven forbid it take you 6 seconds more to fill out some boxes every 4 years
71. Conservative values are against change from traditionalism, in a fptp ESC system it gives rise to his values automatically, he also goes against his own movements because his own votes weaken his own sides movement in FPTP and his electoral funding also dries up since no one wants to fund parties that have 0% chance of winning unless it's to sabotage the side he represents.
72. Go read the quotes - clear it’s in his plan.
73. lol yes they do get a say in who they preference
74. I don't think the Katters are out to sabotage the ALP so the LNP can win, we don't have fptp.
75. In his palatable to the public before they win “plan”. What about his real plan? He’s not going to want to be one and done like Newman and Borbidge. He wants a proper reign like Joh had.
76. No they don't. That's why *you* have to number every box. Because *you* decide where your vote goes. Do you seriously not understand this, or are you just trolling?
77. I can’t tell if you seriously think parties assign preferences rather than individual voters… But parties can give out how to vote cards, which indicate how they think an individual should allocate preferences, but the votes are (obviously) tallied based on the numbering of the ballot. There is not handing of votes from green to labor.
78. No but they choose who to give their votes to. You do realise that minor parties give their votes to a their ‘preference’ that will often get that party over the line. A vote for Greens is a vote for Labor at the moment although I’m not sure how that long will last as the Greens have taken a few Labor seats.
79. No. They. Don't. When you number the boxes it determines where it goes. You could vote greens 1 then LNP 2, and your vote will end up with LNP. Greens have no say in how you or anyone else numbers the box. A vote for the greens is not a vote for Labor unless you put GRN 1 -> LAB 2 The idea that "a vote for the greens is a vote for Labor" is the lowest IQ propaganda play ever, and you have fallen for it because you can't rub two brain cells together and google "how preferential voting works".
80. When all the votes at tallied at the end the minor parties give their vote total to their preferred party. Greens and Labor have been doing it lately and One Nation will preference LNP.
81. You're obviously trolling, lol. Why do we number the boxes then if the parties determine where the votes go?
82. That is numbering them from favourite to least favourite. It’s not a vote for every single party. Tomorrow night the Greens will give all their votes to Labor and One Nation will give their votes to LNP. That is because both Greens and ON won’t have enough votes to form a majority Government. It’s also why LNP tell people to put Greens and Labor last.
83. So why wouldn't we just fill out one box? Why would the electoral commision bother finding out our 'favorite' if it doesn't matter? Anyway, this is clearly a troll because no one could be this daft. Just in case for anyone else reading along... https://www.chickennation.com/voting/ Don't believe this room temp IQ shit.
84. That’s exactly what LNP want and are threatening to do 😂 They want to remove preferential voting because just voting 1 works in their favour. I know you’re calling me all the names but you’re wrong here.
85. Great. So now you agree, the parties don't decide where the preferences flow, otherwise you wouldn't need to number all the boxes and LNP wouldn't be concerned about it. Glad we are on the same page!
86. do the coalition want to be sent into electoral oblivion, because as seen with how things have swung back to Labor in polls, and that they stand a chance (even if i still expect the LNP to win here), restricting Abortion is not a winning position
