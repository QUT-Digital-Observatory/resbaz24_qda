Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. No, what I think is what I said. But on top of that, I'd consider the libs generally unsuitable for power for other reasons.
2. Ah, I did - I made a longer comment that is separate to this one. This comment is not directed at you, but at wider Queensland. I am merely re-contextualising your post. <3 It is difficult to remain quippy while also being fully understood.
3. No arguments here, although just remember that arguably we'd like to have NO scare campaigns, given we just lost to one
4. Quite possibly, and I think it was an important issue to raise. Edit: the fact that this got downvoted tells you everything you need to know about this sub's concern for actually reading what people write
5. Or it was just a scare tactic. Actually, it was just a scare tactic. It was a non issue.
6. If he keeps his promise that the law will not change, will you cop to it? This is a very simple question.
7. Yeah idk. I think it was just the tough on youth crime thing; some narratives are pretty ingrained into the human psyche cross-culturally and this seems to be one of them You youths are just out to get us! /s
8. I think there's definitely a chance they could change. What I also think, however, is that Crisafulli did everything he could short of ruling out the conscience vote (something he is not obliged to do) to tell everyone that he would make sure that law didn't change under his government.
9. What are you even trying to prove with this, mate?
10. I didn't get "taken in" by anything. I have been basing my thoughts on this matter purely on his answers. Why do you he was being asked this question ad nauseum? "It's not in our plan" does not answer if another party raises a bill to make changes.
11. It doesn't matter how he does it or doesn't do it. You can evade this for as long as you like but its a yes, a no, or a non response answer question. If the law doesn't change. Will you acknowledge you got misled?
12. We're in a semantic disagreement now, but I think it's still useful to have Based on my understanding, and google's understanding, a scare campaign is a campaign based upon the terrible things my opponent will do or allow if they get into power. It does not matter if my claims are true or not. Are you saying there is no distinction we can make between Steven Miles's campaign built on free lunches and his campaign built on the risk that the LNP posed for women's rights? Can you see that you're essentially suggesting that scare campaigns aren't built on irrational fear and anxiety, because scare campaigns aren't built on irrational fear and anxiety? I'm not asking people to cop to having their own fact-based reasons for not trusting Crisafulli, I'm asking for them to cop to it if it turns out that they were wrong anyway.
13. I did read your answer, you can still give Crisafulli credit for keeping his word if he takes steps to prevent the law from changing, whatever steps they may end up being.
14. The scare campaign was fundamentally based on the fear that the laws would change. If the laws do not change, then those fears might not have been unfounded in theory, but they were unfounded in fact. Crisafulli promised the laws wouldn't change. Labor told people that they couldn't believe him. It's a scare campaign. So - at the very least, if those laws dont change - if Crisafulli keeps his promise - will you admit you were incorrect, if you thought the laws would change under his government? I'm not saying you should have voted for him.
15. I don't quite understand what you mean. If you mean by what is popular, then reddit isn't a good proxy for that, as we just saw this election. It's a large information silo, but its still a silo, and one of many.
16. Quite possibly, but the ALP tactics of telling people who live in these areas with a problem that they should stop believing their lying eyes and look at this piece of paper that tells them that the problem they are seeing doesn't exist wasn't a good tactic. The new YDC being opened in Capricornia and Cairns will have an impact, IMO. They are creating centres where kids are kept in small units with a maximum of 8 kids and treating the kids during the day like they are in a boarding school. The only risk is kids who end up in these places may not want to go home to their abusive families, which is really sad.
17. Broadcasting that you're ableist, nice. Are you sure you're not with the LNP? In this case, "LockMeDownDaddy," whataboutism was doing the first part of that article, which was unnecessarily distracting from the content of my question. I actually agree that the youth crime scare campaign was just as bad, if not worse. So why aren't I posting about it here? Because reddit is overwhelmingly left wing, with this sub being no exception. So there's really no point me preaching to the choir on that front, now is there? Why on earth would I ask a bunch of Labor voters why they were taken in by the LNP? This may alarm you, but some people can actually acknowledge that something might be bad not only when the other team does it, but also when their team does it as well. Now fuck off, and go and have a think about whether you should attack people out of the blue with discriminatory slurs on the internet.
18. I'm going to take that as a reluctant yes, so credit to you
19. Honestly... I'm not sure. As I said, the LNP weren't winning on a reality based campaign so it may not really have mattered what they did Maybe joined the chorus of tough on crime? I'm not sure But I think habituation probably accounted for a lot of their loss. "Hey, let someone else have a turn" summed up a lot of it. That and maybe being more vocal against the CFMEU to nullify those accusations of being in unions' pockets
20. There is always a chance of laws changing. That is what parliaments do. The risk now is that pro-lifers within Labor have now been given a green light to vote in favour... So before the scare campaign, you had all of Labor seats all of the Greens seats (admittadly, currently zero) and some LNP voting against change... and likely some LNP, and all of KAP voting for change. Now... the failed scare campaign has increased the risk of legislative change by inviting the pro-life Labor right to vote contrary to the failed policy platform.
21. Right, but they most definitely did run a scare campaign, by making it the central piece of their political attacks. Are you actually claiming that Labor did not try to at least capitalise on the abortion issue as their primary tactic of the last phase of this election?
22. Do you even know what KAP was proposing, or were you taken in by the scare campaign they wanted to ban abortion?
23. No, I get the point. The point was to undermine the democratic process and mislead voters in the hopes that a poorly performing and unpopular party could retain government.
24. I might go a little further than you and suggest that the health of the mother isn't a valid reason for post viability abortion either. Sounds extreme, but hear me out, we don't use dismemberment in Australia for late-term abortions. A late-term abortion is performed using a featuside iinjection followed by inducing labour. So the mother is giving birth either way. The only difference is do they kill the baby first. If the baby is viable, and by viable, I mean capable of surviving a premi birth, then why are we killing it? I'm happy to be told why this opinion is wrong, the closest thing I've found to a convincing argument is the extra stress placed on a mother who also has to undergo life-saving treatment while also caring for a premi baby. But that same logic could be used to kill a newborn, so I dont accept that argument.
25. This is flat out not true, he said multiple times, contrary to how Labor painted it, "the law will not change under my government." That is an election promise, there's no getting around it. If Crisafulli keeps his word, will you admit that you were wrong in your anticipation that the laws would change under his government? I really find it psychologically fascinating that so many people are struggling to just say "yes" to this, which is precisely why I asked the question. This goes both ways, you also get to say "I told you so" to everyone if he does change the laws.
26. Ah okay - well you and I are on the same page then. As I said in the post, "I just want to highlight here that I am not talking about myself, or anyone else, who agnostically said the laws "might change," or "might not change." I'm talking about the people for whom quite literally nothing will convince them that these laws aren't now getting changed over these next 4 years."
27. Oh, true - bear with me, I'll get to that shortly I would imagine
28. I will cop it, if when KAP introduces the bill DC refuses a conscientious vote for his party and forces them to vote No. If any other situation plays out then I will say I told you so.
29. I don't think you can call it a "scare campaign" when there is a real possibility that it could happen. It feels inevitable that Katter will look to change the laws, and on matters of life and death, a conscience vote is normally allowed. Several outspoken LNP members have already indicated that they would vote to change the law. Crisafulli is now in a difficult position because a conscience vote could result in a change of law and make him very unpopular with the public, while not allowing a conscience vote will alienate and divide his party
30. I'll answer your question honestly, and in good faith: if he's given a chance to take reasonable steps to hold to his promise that "the law will not change" (i.e., Katter tables the motion), and takes all reasonable steps (i.e., not allowing a conscience vote), then I still won't "cop to" it being a scare campaign, for one simple reason: All Chrisafulli had to do to shut the whole thing down was, when asked questions like "will you allow a conscience vote", answer "no, I won't". The "scare" didn't come from Katter raising the spectre of criminalising abortion, it came from Chrisafulli not giving a straight answer to very simple questions. When asked "what are your views" and "will you allow a conscience vote", he said "the laws will not change". If he meant that, if he intended to take reasonable steps, he could have shut the entire thing down by saying "The laws will not change. If Robbie Katter, or anyone else, brings this kind of legislation up, the LNP as a whole will vote against it". Bam, clear answer, shut it down. But he didn't. He kept answering the questions that weren't being asked, even as a room full of people laughed at him for blatantly and deliberately dodging very simple and clear questions. The only reasonable conclusion I can draw for this kind of behaviour is that he does intend to allow a conscience vote, or at least considers it a possibility. Otherwise, if he intended to not, why would he not just answer "would you allow a conscience vote" with "no"?
31. Grab a comfy seat and enjoy the ride ahead of us! Much to discuss and analyse over the next 12mths.
32. you caught me, man! me and my fellow youths are gonna steal your car and get our taxpayer funded abortions in a drive-by! now hand over the black-market vapes! /s
33. That's the point, he can't rule out a conscience vote. The reality is if a private members bill is brought and LNP allows a conscience vote, the majority would vote for it. So saying it's not part of "our plan" is being tricky, it's a way of telling people what you will do, but not ruling out doing other things. It was clearly designed as a way of avoiding similar situations as this, but because abortion would be a conscience vote, it didn't work. But when governing things change, think GFC, COVID and lesser events, a Gov can't be locked into a course of action because they said it was or was not in the plan, when the situation has clearly changed. That doesn't mean a Gov doesn't have to talk about why they are changing course, why the plan has to change. In a fair media landscape, both majors could have such a discourse and at the next election people can decide if they agree or not. Rather than it being a black and white promise delivered or broken, I mean the LNP will not support a Gov measure but then complain that ALP has not delivered on its promise when it can't pass said promise 🤪 It's why the ideologies and past record is more indicative of what any political party will probably do, look at what they're saying and what they have done previously, and it's their previous actions that will tell you more.
34. Yes it does but democracy (and Rupert) has decided and we have to accept that.
35. That’s what I’m trying to figure out… it’s almost like an LNP stooge waiting to hit us with a crowing “gotcha!”
36. I'm trying to keep our team intellectually honest and non-partisan.
37. No, but "the law will not change under my government" does. If it changes, he will be wrong. If it does not change, he will have kept his word. Will you acknowledge it if he keeps his word?
38. > Will you acknowledge you got misled? "That isn't part of the plan." If, 4 years from now, the abortion laws haven't changed then sure. I'll admit that. But my point is odds are they will be changed by then, because he explicitly hasn't ruled out a conscience vote on it and he knows Katter will introduce a bill to change them.
39. >Can you see that you're essentially suggesting that scare campaigns aren't built on irrational fear and anxiety, because scare campaigns aren't built on irrational fear and anxiety? No, I don't see that at all. My argument is that there's an important distinction to be made. Talking about real, verifiable dangers of what the other guy will do is a negative campaign, not a scare campaign. Scare campaigns are making stuff up about what the other guy might do, which have no basis in fact. Scare campaigns are a sub-set of negative campaigns, because they are both saying "don't vote for the other guy"
40. If he actively takes steps to prevent changes to the current state of abortion access in qld (which he didn’t say he would do btw - he actively avoided questions which pointed to that) I will be very surprised.
41. See you’re not listening mate. I wasn’t worried about his stance because of anything the media said. I was worried about his stance because I watched a press conference where a journalist asked him what was going to happen, and the words that he said didn’t provide a convincing answer. I wasn’t mislead. He failed to convince me, because if what he said.
42. What I mean is that with regards to your straw poll on public sentiment towards the proposition you put forward, people have already responded by saying that, by and large, they won’t be acknowledging they were “taken by a scare campaign” because their fears were informed by real evidence. We had contradictory messaging and statements from LNP candidates, and the leader wouldn’t rule out a conscience vote. If Crisafulli doesn’t change abortion laws during his term, that has little to do with the evidence at hand pre-election.
43. Yeah, maybe they should have focused more on the things they were actually doing to address it. I mean, it's not like they're unaware of it and aren't doing anything.
44. Then it's not a scare campaign to say they might change the laws..... When they wouldn't commit to not changing them. I'm glad they have now.
45. No I’m not claiming that. They definitely added it into their tactics at the end. However it was started by Katter. I’m in no way convinced that something won’t happen because a politician said it won’t.
46. Robbie Katter said that they will put in a bill to repeal decriminalisation of abortion. You can watch him say it on video
47. Be fair - the point is that if the laws do change, Crisafulli will have broken his word.
48. I never knew that was how it was done. I think you're right there. That's so sad.
49. Do you have the clip? I have many clips of him saying "that's not our plan", I have no clips of him stating "the law will not change under my government" [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-23/david-crisafulli-abortion-right-to-choose-queensland-election/104506014](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-23/david-crisafulli-abortion-right-to-choose-queensland-election/104506014) ' "Those laws will not change, my team has backed in that position," he said. ' I just haven't seen this anywhere. Where's the clip? Is this an off-camera interview? but then, In an interview at a Griffith University event last year, Mr Crisafulli said he [supported conscience votes on abortion.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-22/robbie-katter-abortion-laws-queensland-election/104502092) "Those issues are a conscience vote and I will never, ever be the kind of leader that tries to lock people into that \[a party position\]," Mr Crisafulli told former ABC journalist Kerry O'Brien at the time.
50. I guess you're just yelling at a bunch of people who mostly don't exist then, tbh
51. Yes, it's a dude's privilege to not GAF about abortion rights. Knowing the incoming government is stacked with antichoicers is scary for women.
52. A non-issue for everyone, the laws didn't, haven't, and won't change. Freaking out over the possibility is like not getting out of bed in case you might fall down the stairs.
53. Men benefit from abortion the most, don’t have to take responsibility for affairs and mishaps
54. It’s was non issue for the election. People just got sucked in by scare tactics. Nothings going to change, anyone with an IQ above 90 knows this.
55. As you should. If the laws do change, believe me, everyone who voted LNP will not be hearing the end of it from me.
56. Yes, you can call it a scare campaign. Scare campaigns are campaigns built on fear of something happening. That fear doesn't have to stem from nowhere. You both believe and fear that the laws will be changed. Crisafulli said the laws wouldn't be changed - Labor said we couldn't trust him to keep his word. If he keeps his word, will you acknowledge you were wrong and that your fears, while they seemed well-founded at the time, were misguided?
57. Okay. But if the laws don't change. Will you give him credit that he kept his word, and acknowledge that people who were saying he wouldn't or couldn't were mistaken?
58. At this stage, Murdoch is no worse than the the left-wing media.
59. That's right mate, I am an LNP stooge who put them last on my ballot paper. Genius.
60. Well based on your logic, I will now conclude that you \*will\* acknowledge you were misled because you saying "that isn't part of the plan" and "It will not happen under my government" clearly just doesn't cut it
61. Okay I'll grant that distinction, that's not how I understood the term and I don't think that line is universally drawn, but I definitely think it's a sensible way of delineating the two So to rephrase with this new understanding: will you cop to have been taken in by a negative campaign which, while founded in fact, turned out to be wrong? Put differently, and more simply: will you credit Crisafulli if he keeps his promise?
62. That is your right, I just hope you will acknowledge should that day come that what you were surprised at is your being mistaken
63. Sure, okay, let's agree you weren't taken in by the media. So - at the very least, if those laws dont change - if Crisafulli keeps his promise - will you admit you were incorrect, if you thought the laws would change under his government? Or I suppose what you're saying is not that you thought the laws would change, you just weren't certain that you wouldn't I think there's also a bit of confusion because in the post I say explicitly that I'm not talking about the agnostic vote, but a lot of people are still commenting from that "I'm just not sufficiently convinced they won't change" perspective
64. \> If Crisafulli doesn’t change abortion laws during his term, that has little to do with the evidence at hand pre-election. Well not really. Crisafulli provided real evidence that the laws wouldn't change by saying "the laws won't change under my government." Now you can say that that you didn't have good reason to believe him, but if he finds a way to keep this promise, then that means you misjudged the evidence. You prioritised the contradictory messaging, and didn't listen to his promise, which actually turned out to be the better predictor. This goes both ways - anyone who was certain that the laws wouldn't change based on his promise need to be prepared to admit that his word wasn't a very reliable foundation for thinking that if the laws do indeed change. What you're essentially saying is you think you had good reason to believe the scare campaign; but the problem with this approach is that everyone who has ever believed in a scare campaign also thought that they had good reason to believe it. Personally, I'm agnostic - I don't have any strong commitments as to whether the laws will change or not, and it certainly didn't guide my vote. But for others (and I'm not saying everyone, but there are others), they were convinced that if you had an LNP government, that this meant the law would change. And that is something they are right or wrong about. If they're wrong, then they were taken in by the scare campaign, or were part of it, or ran parallel to it.
65. It's because the Miles campaign strategy was to throw as much spaghetti at the wall, and then if something happens to stick, grab onto it. The thing they managed to take hold was abortion and the LNP were caught unprepared for it. The narrative you've probably read that KAP want to recriminalisation abortion is wrong. They want to make a few minor changes around the edges is all.
66. Yes, but if they say it won't happen and they make sure it doesn't, will you give him credit for that? That he kept his word and that the fears that he would not were, while seemingly sensible, unfounded in reality? i.e. we thought we could not trust him but in reality we could
67. They said they would repeal the 2018 laws because they went to far.Th The KAP platform amounts to 2 changes: - removal of social factors as a reason for abortion after 22 weeks - removal of the requirement that a conscience objecting doctor tonrefer you to a doctor who doesn't object, you'd be free to find your own doctor who doesn't object.
68. No promise ever survives contact with the electorate. He is one representative for one seat. The only power he has is to exercise that one vote. Credit to him for not giving in to the false narrative spread by Labor.
69. That's not true. I'm no more yelling than I am whispering; what I am doing is hearing from a lot of people that they really do believe these laws are changing. A lot of people are very scared, and they may have good reason to be.
70. It’s a major issue for me. So is them repealing VAD. So is no free school lunches but MPs get $120 a day budget. So is the environment. So is giving more slack to Gina. But the biggest issue for me was that most of the LNP voted to keep abortion criminal in 2018. Some MPs came out as anti-choice during the election campaign. Katter party now have 3 seats and they will put forward a motion. It’s only a scare campaign if you don’t have a uterus
71. If there is a vote brought, and he binds his MPs to vote no on changing abortion laws, then yes, I'll give him credit. He can say, it was not part of our plan, we didn't do it, and he would have actually taken action to keep the current status quo. But, the plan language, the refusal to answer straight, is because he didn't want to get bound saying no outright, he probably wanted to skate into power and let his MPs have a conscience vote when in.
72. Other than the fact he owns 100% of the print media in Qld. That scenario is not acceptable no matter which side of politics he supports.
73. So please then, spell it out for those of us who clearly lacking your wisdom - what are you trying to achieve with this line of question?
74. No mate it's I actually think it's *you* who is really the clever little fellow
