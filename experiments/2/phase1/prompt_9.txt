Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Seems as though Labor has incorporated many of the policy positions that the Greens used to be unique for just a few years ago. So outside of a few specific cases, they have similar enough policies that personally I’d rather vote for the party with more experience and an established government.
2. >greens >extremist lol. maybe the only thing extremist they've done lately is still attend (I think) the palestine rallies with the hezbollah/hamas flags. They're certainly not extreme left
3. I agree that we need an upper house again. The issue will be re-implementing it after not having one for over 100 years. Neither major party is going to actively suggest bringing it back, so it would have to be the Greens themselves pushing for it.
4. From the ACT and the Greens here are very different to the Brisbane ones. Look at the reactions to losing seats, from this thread QLD is all blame Labor and just attacking them. In the ACT they went from 6 to 4 (looked 6 to 3 on the night). The leader didn't blame anyone else, spoke about how they'd had narrow wins last election, still have confidence in their own policies but accepts that they could've done better and talks about how being in government is good for getting policies done. I'm not sure I could see any of the Federal leaders acting the same mature way if they faced a loss.
5. I agree that the Murdoch media does overblow many aspects of the Greens. And it is probably wrong to say that they "don't" negotiate... but they really aren't showing any willingness to negotiate on a national level currently. There is a lot of frustration that I see expressed where people want policies such as the Help to Buy scheme passed, but any attempt to pass has the caveat of the need for a rent freeze. Now this isn't the only thing they are asking for, but it really does seem like "Greens won't help you buy a home, unless they get to completely restructure the economy overnight by freezing rents". For a political coalition, this is poison. When a coalition needs to gather at least 40% of first preference votes to be in with a good chance you are at some point, usually, going to have to cater to swing voters that can be turned off by perceived instability in an instant. For ACT there is a little political risk to be seen as catering entirely to progressive politics and there really isn't any swing voters there anymore.
6. Really looking forward to voting him out in six months.
7. Hey! You are absolutely right, but let's not kid ourselves that any political party is cohesive or united. Everyone hates each other because they are all paranoid of losing their rank, and can only vent this by hating someone else outside the party or be seen as a traitor. Politics is weird showbusiness for ugly people with ugly souls for the most part, and those with kind souls tend to get eaten for breakfast.
8. You don't think it's got anything to do with the seats the greens campaigned the most in, and negatively against Labor were Labor's safer seats? Maiwar is an example of how they don't need to do this - but choose to anyway.
9. I'm pretty sure our election cycles are every three years but obviously that was far from my point either way.
10. https://preview.redd.it/z3bhy19kufxd1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=08d0bc73f15eec583e80d551df4007cbb1f640e8 You're either dishonest or ignorant. And that goes for pretty much literally every word of your comment.
11. No, that’s not what I said. I said that Labor should have focused on where the real enemy is. Labor likely would have held onto most of its Brisbane seats regardless. The Greens are not entitled to those seats, but what’s the worst that could happen if they got them? Labor loses far more politically by fighting fellow progressives than maintaining their hold on the regions. The Greens, being a leftist party, are not able to compete in the regions, that’s just not how spectrums work, Greens can’t convince people so opposite to them to vote for them. The Greens are only ever going to contest areas with leftist voters. Labor has the ability to compete with Liberal. Strategically, if Labor wanted cheap PT, no anti-abortion laws, free lunches for kids, etc. etc., there was a party they didn’t have to compete with to get those done. Labor wouldn’t have to abandon their Brisbane voters, they’d just have to give more attention to the bullshit youth crime issue and focus more on the communities that felt left behind by the 30 year government. Miles should have made trips to Townsville and Mount Isa and whatever. Labor fighting the Greens just made both lose, they contested where the leftist votes were safe with no regard for the right wing votes. Greens can’t get those right wing votes, so it’s on Labor for making the wrong choice.
12. And lost the election. No-one should have been confused as to which was the more progressive party, the LNP won off classic conservative touchstones
13. Thanks I’m actually a housing advocate for an independent organisation and do research all the parties policies in great depth. Clearly I’ve struck a nerve here 😂
14. Hey what smear campaigns were there about Jonty Bush from the Greens? I volunteered and our strategy was explicitly no smears because we don’t stoop to that level. By smear campaigns I mean Jonty literally mailed the entire electorate claiming the Greens cancelled funding for a festival in Paddington (a lie) and Grace Grace delivered flyers to all McConnel claiming that the Greens candidate was in bed with mining companies (while literally campaigning for no new coal and gas - unlike Labor)
15. Lol in 2022 during Max's campaign, us Greens vollies got called antifeminist among other things, for going up against Terri Butler. Were you one of these people? Because seriously, never have I copped so much vitriol from another party than I had from Labor volunteers, despite the fact that the Greens are most definitely not an antifeminist party and are definitely pro-women and pro-equality. You'd think if Labor were too they'd have preferenced the Greens above the LNP like they have historically done, but they didn't, in a lot of key seats the prefenced the LNP so what does that tell you.
16. Could you expand on this? Curious what big changes they are wanting to make rurally? I always considered most of their policies pretty targetted at city people
17. This was it for me. Focus on their core issues and quit spending so much time virtue signalling on other stuff.
18. Yes the Palestinian issue swayed me also. They are just all over the place and have to get involved in issues that are no benefit to the party vote wise. If they concentrated on being the green party they would be doing very well IMO but they are just incompetent and stick their noses in where they shouldn't. Great name you have there by the way.
19. Yes, for me the strident involvement of the national Greens in the current Middle East conflict put me off completely. It made me feel that they were not yet mature enough of a party.
20. Yep. This isn't 2015, and while it's a majority LNP with swings to them, it was not as large as they'd like. My previous comments I was pretty mad but I've chilled out and let my hangover pass lol. It will be very interesting come the next 4 years with how David moves with this current LNP government. If he wants to keep in, some concessions with moving to the left will be what helps. Every policy by labour etc was extremely popular on both sides, and David has had to answer with a firm no on changing abortion laws after 100+ attempts to get him to give a straight answer.
21. If Miles concession speech was anything to go by, they weren’t expecting a wipeout
22. We are talking about an electorate that would have been LNP originally. Tree tories. A lot will vote Green and preference LNP.
23. Their "inaction" is a result of them getting voted down at every turn by Labor and not having enough elected officials "Greens promised free dental but they didn't deliver so now I'm voting for Labor"... Who are the ones blocking free dental. If people want policies implement they have to keep voting for it. Anyway, I don't trust most people to understand how politics works when they are completely disengaged from it. So be it.
24. Yes the goal is for more folks to vote for progressive, social policy so the major parties shift to be more progressive. I’m not complaining about that. But its important that people know QLD Labor has only suddenly become progressive, because the Greens were just about to steal their seats.
25. No one’s denying that Labor are more progressive than the LNP, but you really don’t have to go that far back to find Qld ALP distancing themselves from Greens’ environmental policies in an effort to jostle with the LNP over mining sector votes.
26. Gas still pays 3% royalties, ships nearly all of it off shore and now we re buying it back, meanwhile they are one of labor’s big donors. You’re unfortunately the one lying to yourself on this one.
27. Not sure about that. Federal labor seems to be taking the approach of moving closer to the LNP to get more of the voters, so it depends if Miles stays as leader.
28. I don't think they're actually complaining about Labor 'stealing' their policy though, if you look at the actual quotes
29. Actually when the Greens proposed it in March at a BCC level, tracking data was a key part of the policy because it was for a 3 month trial to demonstrate proof of concept. You can’t expect a small party to produce completely extensive data on a policy when government data is not publicly accessible and transparent. This expectation is one way that australia will stay bound to a toxic two party system
30. In terms of Queensland politics it was a stated Greens policy for a long time and it’s hard to conceive that the ALP decided to give it a go based on other sources
31. People seem to really hate the greens for having progressive policies. Either they're idiots or they're lnp voters
32. ..and maybe if the two parties were working together against the other end of politics there might have been an opportunity for them to strategically target seats instead of fighting each other.
33. Labor are very clearly neoliberal, they're left wing compared to the LNP, but would be considered centrist in any European country. We might have had more left wing influence, but Labor's management of the GFC was so good it prevented the left-wing protests and demands for change we saw in other countries.
34. They are centre left. Miles' policies were far.more left leaning than what we usually see.
35. It used to be Labor changed them to 4 a few years ago
36. Lol this backs up what I said. What an own goal.
37. Anyone coming for your seat is 'the real enemy'. I'd also argue that Labor wasn't 'fighting the Greens' in Labor held seats, they were defending themselves. It was the Greens who chose to fight there. Labor was already going to lose the election, focussing on unwinnable regions would have been foolish and shortsighted. By shoring up Brisbane seats, they now have more members (with the funding and incumbency advantage that comes with it) who can fight for a whole term. Further, the Greens will now have to focus all their resources on Maiwar and South Brisbane rather than their other target seats (and will have reduced organising capacity) which will make it easier to retain in the long term.
38. You literally just made sweeping statements about Labor's operational intent toward the Greens. Its got nothing to do with your policy research and everything to do with you making really harmful statements to the one progessive party that's actually capabale of governing. I also don't see how you being a housing advocate gives you anymore credibility in your research of policies than anyone else in the electorate? I don't think you have work to for an independent organisation to use Google.
39. Greens smear people every election. I had the local Greens candidate knock on my door and shittalk the local member The local member is LNP and I have no love for him, but don't pretend that the Greens are above that
40. One of the broader Greens policies is limiting land clearing, especially old growth logging. Additionally, there's lots of specific regional policies about protecting various areas from mining, or completely protecting the area, which would remove access to graziers. Wind energy, seen as a renewable advancement welcomed by country groups (but not miners), is being attacked by local environmental groups (which rural folks associate with the Greens accurately or no) because it tends to want the land on top of peaks which is usually the most biodiverse, and their access roads cut large gashes through otherwise pristine land. There's more but that's an easy selection.
41. Stopping mining, stopping land clearing (farming), stopping logging. And theres almost all rural jobs gone outside of service/retail which will then disappear as the rural towns disappear.
42. >Every policy by labour etc was extremely popular on both sides Yes, and no. I think that the ALP has to be careful not to look like the Brisbane party at the expense of everywhere else.
43. Most leaders will have a number of concession/non-concession/victory speeches ready to go.
44. They have voted more with the LNP than a progressive Labour government for example on housing. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-19/adam-bandt-defends-greens-actions-housing-scheme-vote/104372194 https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/explained-the-governments-stalled-housing-agenda-and-why-the-greens-are-opposing-it/wnvzf1i2u
45. Are people not aware that Labor's only goal is to be a party of government? That means conforming to the whims of the electorate, whether that's pivoting right on crime or left on all the greens policies they adopted. I guess I'm just impressed that no matter what Labor chooses to do people complain about it, even when it's giving them what they asked for.
46. No one's denying? The whole culture toward those parties is 'shit' and 'shit-lite' with the direct implication that both parties are almost invariably the same. It's bullshit.
47. Actually I just don't view parties with absolutism but with a pragmatic idea of how elected governments have to operate, particularly as they navigate the most conservative state in the country. I agree the gas royalties are not good, but I think mining royalties are great and a way to deal with it being a huge part of our state currently. (Gone now by the way, from the party Labor has had to try to save us from repeatedly on every government level. Imagine trying to navigate a post-covid economy with the Libs in charge only to hear shit like this). I think free lunches, 50c fares and 50 new GP clinics are very progressive and were the policies Labor put forth, regardless of 'who came up with the idea'. You can sit down and calculate how many 'progessive' policies they act on, their effectiveness and the reality that they are SLAUGHTERED by the LNP, the entirety of mainstream media (including the ABC) and the fucking Greens. Even if you had every policy laid in front of you, you would still point out their failures (comparative to the other major party, incredibly miniscule) as absolute evidence they're not a progressive party. Unfortunately big government does not equal conservative government. But anyone with a populist view on how our country works will disagree. Including yourself.
48. We're turning into the US where you have your choice of corporate oligarchy in red or blue.
49. > While acknowledging the swing to the LNP, Berkman sought to blame Labor for the Greens’ poor showing, saying the now-opposition party had stolen policies around public transport fares (prompting the LNP to also honour 50¢ fares), free school lunches, and incentives for bulk-billing GP clinics. Is that a misrepresentation of his actual quotes? I can't see where to find the original speech in full.
50. More reason why they need to be more collaborative rather than hardline with other parties. They have to know where they are and what they have to do where they need to be, a flexibility and pragmatism is needed than the current hardline stance they've been taking recently. For a left leaning organisation the fine line between a good socialist Norwegian style government vs a bad one like Venezuela or the Nazis or Pol pot is narrow. I've personally experienced it first hand. For now, Labor is looking like the best choice for centre left yet pragmatic stance.
51. I don't disagree at all. I just think it's hypocritical of the greens to run a negative campaign against Labor in their safe seats, then turn around and blame Labor for being the big meanie when it doesn't work out. At least Labor is willing to say 'fuck working with the Greens', I disagree with them, but at least they aren't hiding it. The greens campaigned *hard* against them and then when it doesn't work out pretend they didn't just spend six months shitting on everything Labor did and was actually "wanted Labor to work with them, not against them". Lol.
52. This is good insight, although I disagree about them being Neoliberal only because I think NeoLiberalism is just the inherent practice we're all going into across the Western world.
53. Centre left is still left. But honestly I hate the whole spectrum of conversation about what side parties sit on. Vote on policies, Labor's are progressive and consistent. Therefore, they're left leaning. This 'centrist' shit they get labelled as (not centre left, centrist) is just a way for a negative connotation to be attached that they're not aligning with more fringe voters that want more radical left leaning policies.
54. Backs up what you said? Yikes. Maybe if you're a religious person (delusional). Do you have any data about increased severity of crime despite statewide data showing a large decrease in crime over the past decade? No, you don't. It's just something you think/something the media/LNP brainwashed you into thinking. Don't worry, you're not alone - highly unfortunately.
55. Don't think i did, but you seemed to misunderstand my original point. What part of "doesn't win elections" did you struggle with?
56. Thanks for pointing me in the direction of more research, that’s interesting
57. Mining is what keeps rural Qld going. You can't stop mining as it would be deviating for jobs but you can make Rio Tinto and BHP actually rehabilitate the land properly afterwards
58. The thing is, Labor wasn't the Brisbane party. Their renewable energy plan alone would see Billions going to the regions for infrastructure. They're upgrading the Bruce, and they splashed out on Townsville stadium (Brisbane can't even get one). They just have to make sure those messages are heard.
59. Oh absolutely. I'm just running off the last run of policy data that said exactly the above that's all. Hey, at the same time LNP can't be the FNQ party too. Youth crime you can only go so hard on till the pendulum swings back. The delicate balance of supporting city to rural country has been lost. Hopefully the next few years it's restored and whoever gets in from there continues the trend and the divide is a lot less. I don't like LNP at all, but if they manage to not fuck it up its a good start.
60. Ok, that sounds like the definition of populist. Labor standing for nothing except wanting to hold government. I don’t have any respect for that and prefer a party with strong consistent values. Also - no party is going to cheer on another party for adopting worse versions of policy. Its called politics and while the Greens tend to take the high road, they won’t get votes by saying “good job Labor, thanks so much for taking a shittier version of our policies to the election and claiming it as your own all along. Even though you shit on us and lied about it not being needed just a year or so ago, great work for doing a sudden 180 for re-election.”
61. No one’s denying that shit-lite are more progressive than shit.
62. I believe so. It's possible he used the phrase "they stole our policy" but I don't believe that he said it as a complaint. Labor adopting Greens policy was seen as a win by the Greens
63. Ahh okay! So fascism isn't far right. It's just right. Cause there's not spectrum..... Got it.
64. This. Contrary to some beliefs, we need to be able to recover certain elements from the ground to continue to build a society. But we need to make sure when we're done that we return the land to its natural state, accelerated so that it can recover quickly.
65. The "put it back where it came from or so help me" is a policy most people would go for honestly
66. As much as they "should" (depending on your point of view), very few regional QLD voters will vote against coal.
67. I think you are reading way too much into a concession speech. Very few politicians will come out and say "we were expecting to get obliterated two weeks ago, so this isn't so bad".
68. Pot calling the kettle black there lol, considering the greens as anything other than short sighted populists this campaign cycle is a bit generous. I would say Labor prefers to govern well when possible, but will concede to populist demands when they're loud enough, such as being tough on youth crime or capping fuel price increases (which despite being their dumbest policy was the most popular with Queenslanders). When there's good, progressive, and popular policies they tend to be happy to implement them from what I can see, and that seems to have been borne out by Steven Miles. While it often does come down to idiotic populist policy, that's what wins elections, as the LNP has shown campaigning solely on youth crime that they have no actual plan to deal with (if it was even real to begin with)
69. “Only the impotent remain pure” - Gough Whitlam. Greens can intellectually wank themselves like a political incel all day every day, but the original sin of being in government to actually fucking do anything is you have to get elected, and that means (like an adult) you have to make hard choices and naked compromises.
70. Listen to yourself and recognise you're using semantics to create the exact false equivalency I'm talking about.
71. Cheers, if that's the case that's some wild misreporting. Wouldn't surprise me though! I'll try and track down the full text.
72. "The only way Labor was able to recover some of its plummeting vote was by adopting our progressive policies - things like 50c fares, free school meals, free GP visits, a publicly owned energy retailer, and taxing mining corporations more fairly... With the LNP and conservative lobby groups already on the attack, Labor joined in, pouring all their resources into stopping the Greens in our target seats instead of fighting the LNP across the State. As a result, we now have an anti-choice, anti-renewables, conservative LNP government. Just a few weeks before the election, Steven Miles himself said he’d rather see an LNP government than work with the Greens. Some senior Labor figures are even celebrating last night’s result as a win, even though they’ve lost something like 20 seats. But just imagine what we could achieve if Labor had worked with the Greens instead of spending all their time and money fighting us?" I don't think it's a misrepresentation and definitely comes across as a complaint directly about Labor not working with them (despite the very same email outlining how they targeted Labor seats, lol). This was the post-election email he sent btw so just copied word for word.
73. That’s not at all what I’m saying but I can see how what I wrote could be interpreted that way if you huff paint
74. Come on yourself mate. Fact - they lost seats and the election Go ahead and tell me what you are disputing ______________________
75. Thus the political system is cooked and we will never elect a party with the values and policies we need. With that thinking pervading our system, we’ll forever be the cuck of the political establishment - only expecting what they’ve told us we’re allowed to expect and nothing more.
76. I’m just working within the semantic parameters that you gave me.
77. Here’s a couple of posts from Greens commenting on Labor’s adopting of Greens’ ideas. None are complaining, instead they’re claiming it as a win for the greater good.
