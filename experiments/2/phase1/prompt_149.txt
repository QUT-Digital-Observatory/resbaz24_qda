Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Just to add some information to those who only read headlines and don't delve into the actual data. Those who are saying youth crime isn't an issue or it's trending down probably haven't looked at the data tables that are publicly available here - https://www.qgso.qld.gov.au/statistics/theme/crime-justice/crime-justice-statistics/recorded-crime#past-release-crime-report-qld For some reason, the 2023/24 report isn't available even though some numbers have been released. Therefore, using available data, the quick facts are. Quick facts - In 2019-2020, there were 51,491 offences (5117 against people, 30,456 against property and 15,918 other (mainly drugs and good order)) proceeded against the police by young people aged 10-17 years. - In 2022-23, there were 57,371 offences (6378 against people, 37,779 against property and 13,204 other) proceeded against police by young people aged 10-17. - From 2019-20 to 2022-23, this represents an 11.5% increase in offences conducted by young people 10-17 years. - Breaking this further down, in the above time frames this is a 24.6% increase in offences against people, a 24.0% increase in offences against property, and a 17.0% reduction in other offences. - Looking at regional QLD, noting the reporting of regions changed between 2019-20 and 2022-23 so was time-consuming to put the data together, but comparing Northern in 2019-20 to Northern and Far Northern (same districts) in 2022-23. Offences against people increased 22.9%, offences against property increased 40.5%, and other offences decreased 4.2%. From this data, regional Queensland folk do have a point, youth crime has significantly increased in those areas. But don't take my word for it. Check out the reports and do your own analysis and don't read the reddit echo chamber headlines.
2. This is exactly the kind of thing that causes the very issue you‚Äôre talking about. Instead of trying to have a dialogue or a discourse, you assume everyone who voted a certain way is a moron and you‚Äôre oh so enlightened. It‚Äôs the same bullshit reductive reasoning of ‚ÄúTrump voters are racist‚Äù. If people took a millisecond to try to understand other points of view, this would be minimised. Note: not in QLD, not a Trump supporter. Just pointing this out because it‚Äôs annoying.
3. Oh wow, look at you, political savant of the century! Clearly, you have unlocked the universe‚Äôs secrets while the rest of us lowly peasants wander aimlessly through media-fuelled brain fog. Ever think that maybe, just maybe, screaming ‚ÄòDumb fucks!‚Äô and ‚Äòwaste of space‚Äô at half the state is why no one takes people like you seriously? Newsflash, genius: democracy isn‚Äôt a pity party where your side wins just because you threw all your toys out of the pram. If your master plan to fix the state is to spew insults and act like you're the only one who knows what's best, well, congratulations ‚Äì you've contributed absolutely nothing. Go take a cold shower and calm down; the grown-ups are trying to have a conversation.
4. ‚ÄúMy and many others opinion you are a waste of space‚Äù Here is the problem in itself, that reddit users which are overwhelmingly Labor/Greens think conservatives read and use reddit. If for one moment people like the OP think their posts will change one conservatives opinion to vote Labor and the greens they are mistaken. Do people actually understand this, just read the posts - where are the opposing views, where are the LNP voters. Vent all you like but it‚Äôs an echo chamber that doesn‚Äôt move the dial except to provide Murdoch with news stories.
5. Wow nice one dumb qlders we are fucked now ..... LNP is in power, start finding a new job....... Remindme!in 1 year
6. Honestly I‚Äôve always been surprised QLD has been a labour state for so long. I meet some truly cooked people at work. Far more than the noncooked. I‚Äôve lived all over this country and the craziest people I‚Äôve ever met have been in QLD (had group of god bothers tell me dinosaur bones are fake, had one lady start speaking in tongues at a dinner, some other try to get me to follow some American faith healer preachers). We also have a lot of VIC people move up here, even now they bang on about covid conspiracies and ‚Äúdictator Dan‚Äù in the office. This is also the state that has Pauline Hanson, Malcolm Robert‚Äôs, Katter and george christensen. Some of the nuttiest nutters that ever nut. This really is the Florida of Australia.
7. Yea but ones got to ask why allow the utility companies to charge so high and then give individual rebates? May as well just credit over my fortnightly pension to their friends.
8. Things are about to get a lot tougher for the people living here but that's all part of the learning process unfortunately. We've had a lot of people move here who didn't experience the can-do years.
9. This needs to be a mega sticky post with the hashtag #toldyouso and cross post it every time someone whines and whinges over the coming term.
10. You're welcome to leave just don't let the door hit you on the way out üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
11. Think of the long game ALP will get back in next term and hold positions longer because people will realise that LNP are just corporate shils, this what i hope anyway.
12. And now as a health operational worker I have to worry about being sacked...AGAIN
13. Talk about a thread of sore losers. I‚Äôm surprised you guys are threatening to move interstate because everything will be fucked!
14. Labor had YEARS to try and buy votes with 50c bus fares, rebates, etc etc etc. they waited until it was time for an election before trying to get back in the good books. They‚Äôve been casually sitting on the sidelines doing sweet FA about youth crime, violent crime, and cost of living until the prospect threatened their throne. I‚Äôm not the LNP‚Äôs friend and think the new premier is a tool. But to be fair, labor was lazy and entitled. Having a change for a few years will likely give a fresh perspective to some areas. I just hope it‚Äôs not an attempt to change reproductive legislation. If they start with the far right politics, I will be the first to march with pitchfork and flaming torch in hand Edit: typo
15. I am betting that the electricity rebate was just to hide price rises before the election. Once the rebate ends compare your new bills to last year and I bet it has gone up. They also should have put more money into education if you think that rebait is the correct spelling.
16. I hope every public servant who voted for them gets the sack. Wait a year before everyone is whining that they have no energy rebate this year and cost of living is sky rocketing. They could have had a truly excellent government but instead here we are.
17. If you place faith in the level of intelligence in Queensland you will always be disappointed. Taxpayers fund private/religious schools and we allow a flow of greed, hate and ignorance to flow through our communities unchecked. We have about as much love in us as a bag full of hammers and no one gives a single shit about kids, the future or what a proper government is supposed to do. We deserve the rain of bullshittery that is to engulf us.
18. Two words. Nuclear power. That's what it took to swing my vote, been voting left all my life but they refuse to open their eyes
19. Bro comes to the reddit echo chamber to reinforce his opinion. Best part is the Greens freak nutjobs got a big fat ZERO. Happy days ahead. Long live Queensland.
20. Feel like my vote was pissing in the wind when I vote for labour and see it lose so badly. But that's okay lets vote in the people who say they are "good with money" who spent (this is hyperbole based on personal experience) 90% of the campaign budget attacking other parties instead of EVEN COMING UP WITH A FUCKING BUDGET THEMSELVES.
21. Labor and Liberal both work together to f*** over normal people. I'm just sad we keep switching between them with no real change ever actually happening.
22. Your problem is you think the lunches are "free". Yep that pretty much sums your entire opinion up (psst LNP are just as bad).
23. GFY if you think LNP voters are a 'waste of space'. Democracy in action - the MAJORITY have spoken. Cry harder, snowflake.
24. Funny how all those things you mentioned only started happening when labour knew they were going to lose power. Queensland had one of the most expensive public transport system in the world. Labour was in power for 10 years, why didn't they bring in cheaper transport earlier? $1000 energy rebates, that's just taxpayer money paying for the rebates. Why didn't they actually put pressure on the Labour Federal Government to fix the east coast energy cartel and stop offshoring our energy at a cheaper price than what we pay in the country it is sourced? 20% off car rego, same as public transport, 10 years to reduce costs but nope the threat of losing an election is what promoted that change. Free lunches to school kids, why all school kids? Why can't it be equitable not equal. Does every kid at Brisbane State High School need a free lunch when the avg parent is 1.5 standard deviations above the mean in socio economic status. If they need to spend $1.4B, surely it can be targeted better to those you actually need a free breakfast, lunch and dinner. Abortion? This brought up by Labour and it would be political suicide to even touch on changing that by LNP, so zero chance that happens. Least now, QLD has a chance to not be the laughing stock of the world when the Olympics roll around. QSAC as the venue proposed by Labour, got to be kidding. I am no means a LNP supporter, but you got to take your red coloured glasses off and see things for what they are.
25. Is this your first election? It‚Äôs going to be a hard road if you get this upset every time your man doesn‚Äôt win. I‚Äôm a labor voter, but you‚Äôve got to learn to take your lumps. Throwing your toys out of the cot is incredibly counter productive.
26. Maybe take a second to try and see it from the other side. Labour was simply and obviously bribing the voter base with party favors. How do you know they could afford that cash splash long term without bankrupting the state? If your hot take is that the boomers fell for the LNP rhetoric, maybe you fell for Labor's? Only time will tell.
27. Less government is 1000% a good thing and labor only ever want more power and higher taxes for thier misguided DEI projects‚Ä¶ Labor have done nothing to ensure the long term prosperity and survival of our country. We can talk about creating a better welfare state and taking care of the least fortunate once we secure our future, and that starts with cutting down illegal and legal immigration to sustainable levels and concentrating on Australians first.
28. What a bunch of old drama queens in the comments. Look, it's not ideal, but what is? We survived Newman; we can survive this. Just gotta make sure we keep them honest in the meantime. I can guarantee the 'youth crime crisis' suddenly won't be in the news as much next week, though.
29. I'm leaving. State can get fucked. I don't want to raise my kid here.
30. How good is democracy and the people's right to determine their leader.
31. Remember. The Greens ran ads saying the ALP are evil. They're responsible for diverting votes away. Fuck, I hate the greens.
32. I have so many words I want to say but reading about this result has me physically exhausted. I‚Äôm disappointed, angry and hurt. Just know that I agree with you wholeheartedly.
33. "Yeah well you see, I've spent the last 10 years drinking tap water, and it's just time for a change, something new, so I've decided to start drinking antifreeze. You have to have balance in life."
34. I see you led with 50c fares. If you cant see that was vote buying you are niave. They even announced it and then called the election shortly thereafter. Unfortunatrly the rest of the state and anyone who drives doesnr care about 40c fares in SEQ.
35. Here's the thing. People can arrive at different decisions than you. And that's okay yeah?
36. I really do think it‚Äôs the dislike of Albanese which has damaged state Labor.
37. Let's be honest, Queensland was fucked the moment Queenslanders voted for Palaszczuk in 2020 because she went ultra right-wing with the borders. I knew this result was coming four years away.
38. The fact you think any of that would actually be funded and followed through post election demonstrates just how gullible you are.
39. The majority do not agree with you. You, and Labor, are out of touch. Do some soul searching and listen to what the people are saying. The dismissive attitudes of yourself and other rusted on Labor voters is what has led to them losing two seets they've held for over 100 years.
40. "It's your right to vote, but if you chose the LNP, it is of my and many others opinion you are a waste of space." I assume the reverse is also true, and on this occasion more chose the LNP.
41. How you feel now is exactly how I feel everytime, as you out it, "you redneck morons" vote (Labor in) Your team lost this one. I'm used to being on that loosing side in this state as an LNP voter. Mate one thing I've learnt is that the sun still comes up and nothing much changes regardless of what side is in. It's just how you feel about it all and what social conversations you are having because your entire friendship circle normally shares the same political view as you. I just have a calmer mind as my beliefs lead me to have more faith in an LNP blue team managing the state's economy. So this morning for the first time in a long time I'm smiling drinking my coffee. That's politics.
42. Can this melt down get any better. Greens did exceptionally well also. Some might need a NDIS cruise.
43. Well this is the will of the people. Unfortunately us normal folk have to live with this nonsense, but it'll only be four years. They will inevitably fuck it all up and be booted out. We all know, us reasonable well adjusted folk, that we have to endure this sort of shit as we always have done. But we should brace ourselves, the hardening of the hearts of the world wide populace is still on the incline, and will kill us all. I cannot wait. The human virus will be exterminated from this beautiful planet and it'll spin for another billion years or so, our blip of civilisation not even remembered in the grand scheme.
44. Can't wait to see him get fried over ambulance ramping and hospitals at critical mass. Telling voters "il give them more resources". With what money? They will have to cut some of the C level managers that do nothing positions.
45. We had the "its time" line run by the Libs in the ACT. It turns out it wasn't! Someone claimed the Libs were rejected because the ACT doesn't have a rural rump of miners and farmers in its electorates. Thank dog.
46. Lets just stay calm.. it'll be an annoying 4 years, but we'll be fine. With some protesting of the especially shitty laws they pass, I think some damage can be mitigated.
47. > Lnp has been proven multiple times to be a swarm of corrupt self-serving dishonest sacks of shit And they're about to do it again. Wonder what sort of economic, social and environmental vandalism they'll get up to this time? Without the mining royalties coming in, what will they cut?
48. Crazy how the echo chamber of Reddit doesn‚Äôt flow onto the outside world. The world ended with the No vote and now it‚Äôs ended again with a change of government.
49. The state was doing well. Scared LNP is hard at change.
50. I don't see anyone talking about the narrative how this could somewhat be related to the droves of people who could afford to move out of NSW and Vic during covid and were buying properties sight unseen in QLD. And the people who stayed knew lockdown measures worked and voted Labor to stay in and change over in NSW.
51. Come on idiots, why didn't you buy the election bribes!
52. Pretty glad to be moving interstate soon. Its a shame, Queensland genuinely might be one of the most naturally beautiful areas on earth but fuck me the population here make some truly idiotic decisions. Ah well, good luck with imprisoning poor children, im sure it won't backfire in 10 years or so when they're institutionalised adults
53. Basically, the will cut a bunch of stuff, and hand out those as subsidies to the mining sector.
54. How much debt does QLD have. How many public servants? Labor had there terms . New broom !!
55. Look boomers might done ficktard things but the next lot aren't any better. They are even greedier. This lot now aren't boomers
56. On election day too the amount of labour defaced signs was insane. People had actually made liberal stickers and stuck them over the word labor on the signs
57. Maybe if Labor had done half as much in 9 years as they promised in the last month they might have put up a better showing. Why don‚Äôt you ask Steven Miles of the voters for it wrong.
58. And now we have to go through it all again!!
59. Interesting how we voted for politics over good governance. Oh well we get the shit we deserve.
60. You should be aware that spitting the dummy under this new government will be classified as assault with a deadly weapon.
61. Rich boomers already have money, they dont care about cheap stuff. They‚Äôll still take it but they dont need it. They care more about their rentals and share prices.
62. Perhaps you should respect that the majority of people disagree with you. Maybe you should reevaluate your position to try and understand why they would've voted the way they did
63. Labour had YEARS to try and buy votes with 50c bus fares, rebates, etc etc etc. they waited until it was time for an election before trying to get back in the good books.

I‚Äôm not the LNP‚Äôs friend and think the new premier is a tool. But to be fair, labour was lazy and entitled. Having a change for a few years will likely give a fresh perspective to some areas. I just hope it‚Äôs not Abortion legislation. If they start with the far right politics, I will be the first to march with pitchfork and flaming torch in hand

66. Reap what you sow. Those that voted LNP will no doubt be the loudest when LNP does what it does best, which is run everything into the ground.
67. I totally agree and there is no chance of bulk billing returning now, probably.
68. And Dutton will be Mr ghoul again. See what labor do!
69. I know this is fucking you up and I feel that. Hard. But if it makes you feel any better, it‚Äôs nothing compared to the utter disaster facing humanity Tuesday week. We won the 20th century. It might feel grim now but I think we will win the 21st too. It‚Äôs always two steps forward and one step back. We have come so far in the last 30 years I even think we can afford to take more than only one step back. And then hey, AI will probably supplant us by the 22nd ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
70. Media bombarding with youth crime has been such a hot topic. I'm amazed Labor could claw it back. Still, I'm in mind this is something that was over due. Labor got a freebie with Deb being a dummy during COVID. I look at this hoping people will see the broken promises, and LNP will be destined to lose next election.
71. I'm so confused about this result. Was the whole thing about youth crime? I feel like it was advertised so heavily. But that doesn't make any sense because the crime was mainly in rural places and not the major voting hub. Then David Crisafulli seems like a very creepy character and now we have a possible ban on abortions? It makes me worry for the federal. We really trust these Voldemort looking mofos? Were in a housing crisis and were trusting the government with the most rental portfolios???? Because youth crime??? How backwards are we?
72. Labor brought in self-ID (Fentimann did - woman) which directly impacts women.
73. My view is with the large number of immigrants that don‚Äôt understand/care about who is running the state due to limited knowledge of previous government and been forced to vote is a issue. They simply vote off reading the headlines posted by each party and vote accordingly.
74. Oh well dickhead, guess you better move back to Victoria and good riddance to you.
75. $18.50 for every kid to have lunch? You could send them to The Coffee Club for that price, what a joke
76. It‚Äôs Australians never ending love for the underdog. It‚Äôs weird but a lot of people in Australia seem to be really attracted to the unlikely winner scenario. We are a fair go nation to a fault.
77. 10 years of Labor is almost impossible to overcome at an election. But Labor managed to stem the landslide to a point where they are within reach at the next election. Cycles and all that.
78. Not necessarily - there's always different sides to the many problems in all of Australia and for some, rising crime is prime importance, not cheep car reg, nor fares. A 50c fare means it costs less to be threatened or beaten up on a train or bus. What upsets some is great for others, this is the world.
79. Bad news for wildlife too‚Ä¶ although QLD is bad for wildlife regardless of who is in power but LNP truly hate anything that is native . Only bovines allowed
80. Good to see that Labor, the Marxist mob, got voted out of Qld. Look out AlBozo, you're gone
81. ‚ÄúSome people‚Äù??? It was an election buddy, every Queenslander got a vote. A lot more than ‚Äúsome‚Äù don‚Äôt agree with you. That being said, the 50c PT fares sounded cool. But, bread and circuses will only take you so far. Don‚Äôt worry, in a few years you can get it reversed, yeah?
82. The state of Queensland isn‚Äôt just in the South East Corner. We get none of what the ALP offered in the North so we need a change, 50c transport I wish cost us $100 just to go buy the basics in clothing The mining companies provide free transport for the communities that they are established in give funding to keeps sports and community groups opened and functioning The hydro renewables were about to destroy some pristine rainforest and farming country. Besides the coal in Queensland is mostly metallurgical coal used for Steel production not power so that‚Äôs why the LNP got in because you can‚Äôt see past the Sunshine Coast
83. The whole country is run by corrupt politicians. Nothing will change until the system changes.
84. Cry about it left–∞rd. Also both LNP and Labor suck dick.
