Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Get fucked, I worked for years for meals on wheels preparing food for the elderly in the morning. At least I did before I had to stop work and become a full time carer for my partner and father to our two kids. Try again with your baseless assumptions. I am happy to accept a democratic result. That is why I am doing what I can to get out of this state, because I accept that the majority of people here wanted change and they think this is what they want. Mate I honestly could not care who is in government if they are doing their job and proving the services my community needs to function. Not that Labor was doing a good job mind you, but now we get to see exactly how conservative the people of Queensland really are because I actually took the time to learn exactly what their policy agenda is and it reads like The Handmaid's Tale.
2. this specific post was just a lil joke around the fact Labor lost. Like I'm happy to joke against my own voting preference chill, you can laugh at the joke dude. Alao I may have a career in state government that makes me not really care who's running the joint overall. But I can still validate my opinion on what I'd prefer more y'know
3. I am not from Qld, you probably should just read my post again.
4. Sometimes those with a brain lose too. It appears hard for a fellow robot to admit his human fallacies as a product of humanity.
5. Neither side is bud. It wouldn't hold up otherwise. Labor only governed the south-east region of the state. That's why they lost
6. The ‚Äúboth sides are the same‚Äù people are some of the scariest voters imo. Dumb as heck and easily swayed either way. Either party could offer you a pack of chips and you‚Äôd side with them. Horrifying.
7. I‚Äôm talking the free power rebate, or free school lunches free this free that. ü§°
8. So get a job so you don't have to work for the dole? This is Australia, if you want to work, you will find work unless you are a tired prick which will see you get the arse once the employer sees what your work ethic is like. I can see why you are a fan of the ALP/Greens coalition. You like free shit hey?
9. Okay that makes sense to me, my Mum has worked on the Dole and yea the employment prospects are definitely NOT favourable. I can see where you're coming from, however I do feel like comparing it to slavery is a bit exaggerated. Thank you for sharing your point of view
10. And people have listened to your concerns...many times. You misrepresent the views of others and don't listen to what they are saying. Yes you have a democratic right to voice your opinion, but you also have an obligation to listen to others voicing theirs. I'm not sure if it's the Aboriginal communities causing an increase in crime, I haven't seen any data to suggest that.
11. That was one example of a policy the left didn't seem to understand. I don't have all the answers for why they voted the way they did because I didn't vote LNP. My point originally is we need to make an effort to understand and address their concerns instead of just mislabeling the whole thing as misinformation and stupid. Or that it was simply for change, even though that's a valid position.
12. Sorry, what do you mean by your first point? I think the statewide stats hide pockets, even in SEQ, which have higher rates. NQ was just an example. I wasn't saying that was the reason they voted LNP, you need to actually listen to them why they voted, I was just disputing the narrative that crime wasn't an issue at all.
13. You just don't get it do you.... Sitting in your ivory tower looking down upon the plebs. I know it may be hard for ignoramuses such as yourself to understand but, you can't in your right mind look out your Brisvegas window and say no crime here so must be all good across the state. There is more to Qld than just Brisbane and there definitely is a crime problem within areas of Queensland. 2023 crime rate for all offences in Mackay. 18,598/100,000 people. 2023 crime rate for all offences in Brisbane. 9,043/100,000 people. Mackay has more than double the crime rate of Brisbane in 2023. 2024 to date crime rate for Mackay. 14,807/100.000 people. 2024 to date crime rate for Brisbane. 6,818/100,00 people. Again, Mackay has more the double the crime rate of Brisbane. For 2023 Cairns had almost 3 x the rate of Brisbane. 2024 Cairns had more than 3 x the rate. For 2023 Townsville had 2 x the crime rate, 2024 Townsville had 2 x the crime rate. for 2023 Rockhampton had more than 3 x the rate and 2024 Rocky experienced nearly 3.5 x the crime rate. And the list goes on.... You may think that this is acceptable as you may not live in these areas but the people in the regions do not accept this and so have voted the ALP out as a result. By denying the facts and ignoring the regions you will never fix the crime problems which exist there, which is fine by me as it will ensure a 2nd LNP term.
14. Does that count for you too? Seeing as you spend all your time on reddit‚Ä¶
15. Bahaha. I had no idea that you all treated the Handmaids Tale as a documentary.
16. Yes, I can. I can also tell you what I think. You can accept the fact that people disapprove of you not voting, chill.
17. No, it isn‚Äôt. Why are people that don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre voting for able to have a say? Their say means nothing, if you were to talk to them, you‚Äôd realise these people don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about, they don‚Äôt understand the policies of either party, their vote means absolutely nothing in that respect. Yet it means something to the election as it‚Äôs a number that counts. Be cooler if only people that understood what they‚Äôre were voting for could vote, and affect the future of states and the nation.
18. No neither party offer anything I want so I vote for the closest to that but I still have my bias against left wings politics so I vote right but most ‚Äúfar right‚Äù political party‚Äôs in Australia are only small so nobody votes for them I personally tighter border control decriminalisation of marijuana to a similar extent to the us and our self defence laws to be actually worth having and to stop cutting funds towards health care pensioners police lower taxes overall especially on alcohol so we can have a actual nightlife scene in Australia people can afford to go and do and take some off the bullshit power from police ie jacks law and all the being able to hassle people without a real reason and give them the ability to lock actual criminals up if any one party offers that sweet they have my vote
19. Paid for with mining royalties. Queensland has been running a surplus for years.
20. Can I help you? The other guy and I were having a conversation. (Is the energy I'd hit you wish if you were in front of me, learn to read the room
21. Modern day slavery is very different from slavery as you think it. It was definitely comparable to a prisoner work camp st the very least. To downplay from slavery I'd say things like, compulsory, required, mandatory, non-optional With negative consequences if you didn't turn up. But yeah you could make the choice to not turn up. But you'd lose your welfare payments if you chose not To. Still free to choose though I admit I have a bias as well. And no worries thanks for being a normal person on this post. Have a wonderful afternoon back then I was lazy and didn't want to work. Still didn't deserve that tho haha
22. Nah there's no misrepresentation, you lot just don't like being called out for your regressive thinking.
23. I‚Äôm saying a lot of people went into the polls thinking labour is soft on crime even when crime in their area is down because the messaging had hammered it as a state wide issue. Crime being up for 10% of the population in areas with the toughest problems is not indicative of a systemic failure of the government. LNP campaigned on fearmongering and on the media blowing specific cases out of proportion. And yes I think a lot of voters bought the story and let it influence their vote‚Ä¶ I think they got conned and I think they conned by an appeal to their baser instincts. That‚Äôs a pretty established tactic that appeals to the conservative side of the public.
24. Again, I am not from Brisbane nor did I mention Brisbane once. Not sure what ivory tower you think i live in or why you keep making shit up. Since you seem to have difficulty with reading I will explain this as clearly as i can. In Mackay in 2020 there were 9173 offences committed. In Mackay in 2021 there were 8802 offences committed. In Mackay in 2022 there were 8350 offences commited. In Mackay in 2023 there were 9042 offences committed. The crime rate now is lower than it was in 2020 so where is this massive spike in crime in Mackay? The answer is that it only exists in your head.
25. Sounds like reality hitting home and you are projecting a bit. But hey, who knows.
26. If that‚Äôs your feeling, you should be advocating for education, not the disenfranchising of our fellow citizens because they don‚Äôt have the time or resources to learn.
27. Tbh mate, just writing the way you do tells me everything I need to know.
28. The mining royalties did not directly fund anything - Those royalties went into general revenue
29. While we‚Äôre 150odd billion in debt? And accumulating more faster then we can pay off? Not to mention the net 0 bullshit we won‚Äôt be mining anything soon. China and any other nation willing to line the governments pockets will be allowed insteadüòÇ next will be farming and manufacturing. Vote labor vote greensü´£
30. Sorry mate, you were posting on a public forum so.......
31. Not just Aboriginal communities goose. Cairns, Mackay, Townsville, Rockhampton, Mt Isa, Bundaberg, etc. all have a much higher crime rate than Brisbane. Some of them 4 times the crime rate. As CheeseBurger says the hard data and facts are right there on the Qld police web site if you choose to educate yourself. It can't be denied and if you still say it is not so, then it is dills such as yourself who simply excuse away the facts with your inner-city dwelling decision making, that have caused the ALP to lose.
32. I'm not sure your first statement is entirely true. You would need to ask the LNP voters in areas which are safer for their reason why they voted the way they did. I haven't seen anything to indicate either way. This is the problem with echo chambers, people of opposing views are often shouted out of the conversation. About 40% of QLDers live outside of SEQ and have a bit of unity around being regional/rural. They felt they were neglected by the state government and crime was just one example, not the only one. ALP fear mongered too, let's be a little bit less biased. I'm not sure the LNP blew it out of proportion. Their solution of locking up kids is stupid as shit, but at least they acknowledged there even was a problem.
33. Look the LNP said they were an adult‚Ä¶ I can explain everything.
34. It‚Äôs possible to do both. I support, and wish, people were more educated about what they‚Äôre voting for. I also wish people had to be educated on what they‚Äôre voting for before they were allowed to have any impact on the future of our state or nation in any way.
35. I believe people should have a choice not have to bow that‚Äôs it
36. Ffs, look at the proposed budgets between the two major parties. There's fucking nothing between them in projected debt. One side is going to get there by cutting services and scrapping energy infrastructure and one was going to get there with royalties from mining. What the fuck are you even yapping about?
37. Everything you just said is bullshit made up by Murdoch. There you have it folks this is how you lost the best premier in the country
38. Oh nah nah nah I meant like. You can. And I did reply. And I've replied again I'm just saying that's the type of energy I'd hit you with I'd still hear you out dude haha
39. I didn't say it wasn't an issue, but again tougher penalties for kids who assault guards isn't making communities safer, and i very much doubt the problem is larger than it is. Keep living in fear boomer. Yeah just as I thought, there is no 23-24 data set currently, only 22-23 so old data for one. Next 10-17 youth crime is up 13 percent, a whopping unique offenders is up 0.1 percent, hardly a massive crime spree and you can all dial the data down and see that yes, aboriginal and Torres Strait islander youths make up over half of 10-17 offenders. So a big scare campaign and a problem over inflated to score political points.
40. Again I don‚Äôt get what you think you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúthe other guys had a stupid solution‚Ä¶ but hey at least they didn‚Äôt try to show me the research that showed why my feelings are wrong‚Äù I grew up in rural Qld and I have a reasonable good idea of what those communities can be like. I wouldn‚Äôt put exposure to a diversity of ideas high on that list. I think it‚Äôs very easy to sway them on dissatisfaction and easy targets. Again the classic resentment that not enough is spent on ‚Äúrural‚Äù qld is another one that‚Äôs easy to play up. And for what a party that has a proven track record of being worse?
41. We all know if you tossed enough monkeys in a room with typewriters eventually you would get Shakespeare. But no one ever expected that if you tossed enough donkeys in a room with ballot boxes you would get the government of Queensland.
42. Democracy means no exceptions, my friend. We may not like the results but I‚Äôd fight to the death to defend my political enemy‚Äôs right to vote.
43. Nope it Funds General budget of which are in deficits Those election promises had no future funding guarantees
44. There is no change to the royalties structure under LNP. There is a change to the royalties revenue coming in though. This is due to the royalty revenue per unit of product sold being on a sliding scale. When commodity prices are high the royalty price/unit is high. When the commodity price is low, the royalty price /unit will be low. The royalties payments in the future will be back to traditional levels because commodity prices are currently low.
45. Oh no, no that pesky Murdoch again.... Can't the ALP take any responsibility for their bungling of Qld? This is why they were ousted.
46. Pull your head out of your backside and do a quick google search of Queensland's debt. We aren't in surplus, we are billions in debt.
47. Yes 2024 data is there. Remember to look at rates not numbers. Not a boomer. That would be Mum and Dad.
48. I'm not supporting the other guys. I am against misrepresenting other voters and the facts around the crime statistics.
49. I would too, if they could prove they understood what they‚Äôre voting for.
50. That would be like saying that a persons income doesn‚Äôt fund their housing and food because the person has a credit card debt
51. You haven't seen bungling, give it a year and the libs will show you.
52. ***People*** make money when they work and consume. The ALP govern to the principle 'look after the ***people*** and they can work harder and make more money to spend'. The LNP does not approach the matter this way. The LNP flog the people and strip them of services so the LNP can give free money to their morbidly obese mining mates.
53. I see you're trying to interpret raw data, well I just had a look and it's not promising for your argument. And like I said from the 22-23 collated report there was only 0.1 increase in UNIQUE offenders, and trends don't generally make massive changes so it's not likely changed and again aboriginal and Torres Strait islander youths make up over half all offenders 10-17. So you can keep quaking in your boots.
54. Ha, what a muppet.. Best you pack your shit up and move to Vic. Their election is in 2026 so better start on the campaign.
55. I guess there is no convincing you with facts. Oh well, you just keep living your best life under a LNP state government.
56. Stop projecting. I am not one of the muppets that voted for their own selfish interests.
57. Oh I see, it's all about the facts is it? Well fact is youth crime while a problem like all crime is vastly overblown.
58. Is it though? The point was that Crime may be OK where you are in Brisvegas, but it is not OK in the regions. It is a concept you still fail to grasp...
59. Oh yes. I have serious doubts about kids with abusive parents though.
60. Hahaha, if you'd actually gone over the data like you claim to, you'd see crime is barely higher than Brisbane, and in fact if you group the entire greater Brisbane area together it is fact higher than the "regions" and finally "outback" is the highest contributor to crime as an area. So the one failing the concept test is not me.
61. Ahh, no it is not. Here is the link. [https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/queensland-crime-statistics/](https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/queensland-crime-statistics/)
62. LOL. If most people had a conversation with Crisafulli for ten minutes, they'd realise what a bigoted, self-important jackass he is.
63. Hmmm. OK. Are you looking forward to dismantling the various programs started by the previous government? 50c PT fares funded by mining royalties - royalties charged as an access fee to resources owned by us? I mean, we should see \*some\* payback for letting mining companies extract valuable resources. Subsidised school lunches? Cost-of-living energy rebates? Renewable energy programs like the pumped hydro projects? Please, give us your insights.
64. All these people saying they‚Äôre happy to see a change in government can never actually pinpoint a reason why, and can never go further than a personal insult at Miles or something about a youth crime crisis. Yes some of the reaction in this sub has been overblown, but you‚Äôd know there‚Äôs good reason for that if you were alive and conscious in QLD in 2012-15. And also the fact this Labor gov has given us way more cost of living relief than any other state and have put out one of the biggest renewable energy plans in the world, without raising taxes and with two straight surpluses. I‚Äôm confused why you‚Äôd be so desperate to change that
65. I love Queensland. I moved here just over 2 years ago. But I have to say the majority of people while lovely, are simple minded folk. Which seems to be why conspiracy theories, wellness woo and like have such a strong hold. It‚Äôs really not a flex to be part of the qld majority. You‚Äôre better than that.
66. Don‚Äôt bother mate‚Ä¶ This sub is hard left leaning. There‚Äôs no point saying anything nice/positive about any conservative political parties in QLD. You‚Äôll just get an army of Labor and Greens fanatics calling you dumb and relentlessly repeating all of Steven Miles‚Äô fear campaign slogans.
67. Im extremely confident you will see this government operation like the highly effective and Brisbane City Council, focused on infrastructure, service delivery and moderate social initiatives.
68. Only thing that bugged me about him was that thing he had going on with his mouth, reminded me of Supernintendo chalmers assistant Leopold.
69. Im extremely confident you will see this government operation like the highly effective and Brisbane City Council, focused on infrastructure, service delivery and moderate social initiatives.
70. I'm more concerned about who is behind him. Smart people are rarely picked for public office. People like SC are there for the public relations aspect. Which is strange, 'cos he's a creep. It's the power brokers behind the scenes that I'm worried about. The LNP leader can be replaced on a whim.
71. Coal & iron ore royalties are forecast to fall. If you know what's happening in China their domestic demand for steel (and the coal to fire the mills) has gone off a cliff. Add in Trump's expected victory and the anticipated dropoff in demand for Chinese exports and aussie resources demands go further south.
72. Yeah you‚Äôre completely right, why vote a change in government because the previous has put programs in place. Judging by the list you‚Äôve provided I can see you‚Äôve easily been bought. I want to see some genuine money spent on infrastructure not buying votes in the form of transit fares lol
73. And people like your are the exact reason why the LNP won (and also why the referendum failed btw). The electorate doesn‚Äôt make mistakes, and insulting the voter base (especially their intelligence), is a very quick way to turn off voters
74. I love Queensland and its people. I‚Äôm sorry you feel that way, have you considered moving back to Melbourne?
75. Okay and please tell me what infrastructure plans has David brought forward that won your vote
76. What money brother labor had the mining company as a piggy bank, lets see oh yeah that's being scrapped for zero reason at all. So you aren't gonna see shit be built mate, Crisafulli's gonna do what Newman did and have kunts fix up the area around his house. So unless you live in bulimba with the prick you ain't seeing fuck all built mate. Can't wait to see the guy who's just parroted the word plan, with checks note's; no plan at all turn QLD in to a utopia through cuts. Would be nice to see that state owned energy infrastructure be built, oh wait that's gonna be cut, for checks notes smaller pumped hydro, quickly checks LNP costings; no money allocated at all to smaller pumped hydro infrastructure they claimed they were gonna do. Nothing will be built its cut, sell, privatize, so yes I will gladly sit back as things go backwards and watch fnq and the regions reap what they sow from fingers crossed an LNP majority because I did my best to stop the fire but shit I'm gonna watch it burn and hope it burns fast through a majority LNP.
77. Haha. Truth hurts. But seriously we can‚Äôt even have fluoride in our water because of the amount of fucking idiots in our region.
78. I‚Äôve only been there once for work. I didn‚Äôt care for the place. ‚ÄúSo long as they (the Proles) continued to work and breed, their other activities were without importance. Left to themselves, like cattle turned loose upon the plains of Argentina, they had reverted to a style of life that appeared to be natural to them, a sort of ancestral pattern...Heavy physical work, the care of home and children, petty quarrels with neighbors, films, football, beer and above all, gambling filled up the horizon of their minds. To keep them in control was not difficult.‚Äù They would buy the Murdoch tabloid press for the sport, and occasionally turn to the front to be told who to vote for.
79. The truth is, Labor lost, the Greens lost, and if you want to keep on insulting the electorate‚Äôs intelligence, then look forward to losing more.
80. I don‚Äôt do it to their face, I smile and nod when they tell me my friend who are climate scientists that‚Äôs are obviously corrupting the data so they can keep their cushy jobs, or how covid was all a government conspiracy to test how much they can control us.
81. Gonna be tough from memory the Senate inquiry into Murdoch media said he own +90% of QLD print media
82. Here is a start from Perplexity AI for you‚Ä¶ **Positives:** - **Economic Growth:** Queensland‚Äôs economic growth has generally exceeded the national average, driven by strong population growth, resources investment, and robust mining and service sectors[4]. - **Employment:** The state has experienced strong employment growth, with low unemployment rates compared to historical standards[3][4]. - **Infrastructure and Services:** Significant investments in health, education, and infrastructure have been made to support population growth and improve living standards[1]. **Negatives:** - **Fiscal Challenges:** The government has faced fiscal challenges, including managing deficits and debt levels[1][2]. - **Labour Shortages:** Persistent labour supply shortages, especially in construction, have posed challenges[1]. - **Housing Affordability:** Rapid population growth has strained housing supply and affordability[1].
