Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. I agree it's all broken. It's hard to condense answers for these broad topics into a format that people will actually read here on reddit, especially when it seems a lot of people would rather revel in prejudice and fear instead of conversing issues. So you'll have to forgive my tenuity at times. But to answer some parts of that, this adult person in the example should absolutely be held accountable for this brazen disregard of the law. Personally, the marijuana operation if non-commercial wouldn't be a big deal in my view. But that person should be behind bars, I've met people who've done less and done time. How this is decided is really beyond me. I will somewhat go one better (or worse I guess) and say this is very common with domestic violence perpetrators as well. Actually I'd go as far as to say DV is a much much bigger issue than we attribute to it, effectively all the resi/crime kids I've come across are victims of it, many becoming perpetrators themselves in one way or another. I'd personally have a national task force for this issue alone, but that's just me. We've made some progress on this issue, but it's very far from adequate. But now we come to the crossroads, what to do with those children, those young adults that continue to do "crime". They've lost all ambition because they have no sense of direction, no hope for themselves. They've lost all respect for an even greater number of reasons, including a lack of foundational parenting which leads to the lack of respect for authority to begin with, and a soft, yet cold, child safety and justice system. Add in all the social pressures of our modern societies, gentrification, inflation, and its easy to see why this is probably the most challenging time for an unstructured, traumitized and neglected young person to be alive. But they do need to be taught respect. They do need to be held accountable. They do need to be rehabilitated. And what we have right now from both major parties isn't good enough for any of that. Hard decisions need to be made yes, but compassion doesn't have to be lost on them either. I was one of these children once, nobody ever sees it through their eyes. And if they did they'd realise they don't see more than a few feet in front of themselves. The issues are deep, and require significant cultural change in our societies. I don't believe any "government" on their own will change that, it really does take a village to raise a child. Now more than ever.
2. Let's start with the question "what actually is an *adult* crime?"
3. Do you have any faith that the LNP will be able to do that? Absolutely no chance they won't completely fuck up
4. It's not public service. It's something else. Can't go itno too much detail without doxing myself.
5. Complicated circumstances I can't really go into without giving away where I work and it's pretty easy to dox myself from there. I have been looking for other roles in the meantime. There's been nothing around. And LNP completely gutted my industry last time they were in so it may happen again. Just had a family member invite me to move to Melbourne to live with them tho. Might open up a few more opportunities.
6. You'll need to be more direct about what truth you think is doing damage here, as nothing has been said here that hasn't been repeated ad nauseam by Labor members coping over their loss over the past several hours. You lot are showing a remarkable lack of introspection for a group who was just wiped from two seats you had held for over 100 years.
7. Measures which are of little benefit to many people, and do nothing to address their other concerns. If the majority agreed with you then you would have won. Normal people have the ability to empathise with other people, and see their point of view. It's astounding to see how uncommon that is amongst Labor members over the past few weeks.
8. Probably whoever within the Labor party's strategy team decided to ignore regional crime, lie about the LNP's plans for abortion, and fund travel subsidies in SEQ instead of fixing the Bruce Highway. LNP really owe those guys a debt of gratitude.
9. He's clearly a neolib. I don't think you're gonna be able to get through to him. If it's not literally someone taking your money, it doesn't count to them. Punishing poverty and forcing people into it indirectly is perfectly acceptable to these types
10. Got any new comments? Any thoughts of your own on the matter?
11. Katter is irrelevant, even he lost seats over it so he’s already back tracking on the motion
12. Go live in FNQ and let me know if your thoughts change . These kids get away with murder (literally) and laugh about it . There are no consequences and people are over it. They broke into my grandmothers 91 year old friends house and bashed her with a wench . You know what they got , a slap on the wrist then the next day they're out stealing cars and setting them on fire in a paddock. Cycle repeats. They know they're untouchable. They laugh about it . Please tell me what you would do in this situation. Would love to Hear it
13. Yes... that's the point of my comment. It was a joke on the language used Man its a tuff crowd around here atm lol
14. Time will tell. Do you have any faith that the public service will self regulate and place KPI's on their own staff to root out the dead wood and lift productivity? I don't so someone has to do it. This is the reality for everyday workers outside of the public service. If you do not perform you get the boot.
15. Slashing public services that these people rely on, leveraging the justice system as a tool for disproportionately imprisoning the poor while rich mates are let off. Criminalising abortion (don't fucking bother denying it cunt) taking away puberty blockers (and they always go after gender affirming care once they're done with them, this is an established pattern with your lot at this point) which WILL increase suicide rates of trans people. Though I get the feeling you think that would be a good thing. Literally just read anything the LNP have done or tried to do throughout the entire history of their party you fucking dipshit
16. Apparently a neoliberal who voted labor. Just not an insane person. Who thinks the world is ending because my “team” didn’t get in.
17. Youth crime is down and dropping. I know that doesn't mean it isn't happening, if your story is true it's horrible. I really do get upset reading these things but I wouldn't increase their sentencing limits. Afterall, your grandmother's friend's attackers didn't get sentenced AT ALL (which is fucked up), so maybe there should be inquests into judges/police and their practices which would be far more useful than increasing sentences. There is ZERO evidence that increasing penalties deters crime, but the fear of getting caught (i.e. more police) does. So I would increase police numbers in problem areas in whatever way I could, importing police, incentives to join the force etc... All the research points to reducing poverty and increasing agency (like increasing education and available activities) as the main ways to reduce crime. We'll never be able to stamp crime out entirely, that's naive, but it's coming down across the board. It's a slow process and it's working. I also think these kids should be put into programs to actually correct their behaviour. Yes, they should do time, but they've obviously grown up in some fucked environment to come out of it like that and need help to reintegrate with society. Putting them in an adult prison for 15+ years is just going to ensure they come out of it as a hardened criminal.
18. Your wife is on the money there, though I must suggest that the common "social/youth worker", let alone any social/care service provider, is essentially also an "entity" in this context, particularly in the view of these children and how the system is run. Also there are not enough workers that are genuinely that warm and involved with these children, and the "rules" and funding generally don't accommodate such workers either. Get paid and go home. In my opinion that's especially true of management types. They can say what they like. Add in a culture of hanging people and clients out to dry when incidents occur and that's only the beginning of the troubles. I've had to fight tooth and nail against bureaucrats to have bad decisions overturned, basic necessities or basic luxuries afforded and common sense programs and freedoms given to my clients. I've stayed with kids for days on end. It's all so tiresome. We cannot afford to be conservative here, it's going to cost us greatly later on (and we see that with the crime already). To a large extent I think that Child Saftey themselves foster the purview of these children that they are not reliable and not trustworthy. That they are dictatorial and cold. That they are third world citizens and not worthy of the basic standards and progress in our modern society. They themselves are overwhelmed and can't afford to as directly involved with these children as they should. Look back to what happened in Toowoomba when that kid died 6-7 year ago. CS were so overburdened nothing could be managed. That's happened again in Innisfail, and it's being swept under the rug. This time with a client's child no less. These resi houses are cold and barren environments, and they are run like prisons without proper guards, but rather in many cases untrained cadets off the streets. That's no fault to them, but this culture and this lack of wholesomeness that this system has created an environment where nobody even *wants* to care. And I don't blame them. There are exceptions, but by far and away no. Foster care seems like a better approach, but the stress is incredible. Of the few there are, many won't take the older children. It's already "too late" for them. My wife works as an in home therapist herself, if it's not the bureaucracy that sends them mad, it's the lack of support and half heartedness of it. I could go on about the funding systems and what not, we'd be here all day. The "village" is just not there. And the neighbours would certainly be happy to see them cease their caring arrangements. The world is a shitty place for these kids. And we only further influence that view. At some stage the only option left is going to be excluding these children from the greater society. How we go about that decides their fate. But as it stands now there is nothing wholesome about this system. Whether they are in lock up or a resi house or even on the street, the world is a cold dark place for them. Why do you think they steal cars? It's freedom and progress, not just thrills and fun. A luxury that isn't often afforded to them in care. Why would they want to be there?
19. First line, first three words. "Slashing public services". Take things that people currently have away from them, end up with more money than you would have had. It might be hyperbole to call it looting since it's legal, but it's also disingenuous to ignore it when it happens.
20. Here's hoping you and your family need to use a public hospital in the next 6 months. None will be there to help you. Just like none was there last time the LNP won.
21. It's actually pathetic how these people just pretend like 2011-2015 never happened
22. Just like a lot of regional hospital services are not there now and have been not there for some time under ALP. LNP will have to try hard to do worse for regions that what they have been dealt under ALP leadership.
23. Ah. And here it is. The "I'm different from the other guy because..." until you win. Then, as soon as you win you're "But the other side..." Explain to me how you are any better than the other side, in any true sense. I know I'll never get a response to this because you know you are not. You have voted to further reduce funding to every segment of our society because 'but the other guy..." In short, you are a waste of Oxygen.
24. Get ready boys, time to pay more taxes so we can send those sweet mining profits overseas
25. Ah yes, because \*checks notes\* 50c fares are "toxic socialism".
26. I've never understood the "mediscare" line, under the LNP bulk billing flatlined as they refused to index it, and they cut hospital funding. It wasn't a scare campaign it was just facts.
27. So many cookers who don’t know what they voted for and in a years time when there energy bill rebates are gone and the live next to a nuclear power station they will be all pikachu face.
28. the liberals are the biggest ass-ride for KAPs backwards as fuck state wide policies.
29. I really wish these idiots would learn the difference between communism and socialism. Pretty sure they believe its one in the same.
30. Mediscare - lol - “patient tax will see end to bulk billing”… I’m sure that was a part of the LNP campaign and the AMA asked them to stop saying it… AMA a freaking mainstay of conservatives.
31. The global fascists are upset.... Quick, try to silence all those with differing viewpoints and opinions.... Bigots.
32. Oldmate uses (context) too much. Just structure your sentence better.
33. Labor imported Yank culture war politics cry the Libs unsuccessfully trying to make trans panic a thing for years. Ffs.
34. Cancelling the olympics right now will probably be a good thing. I dont see any return on that investment. Olympics have been known to hurt countries finances for years.
35. Orcs would have been pissed off about Saruman taking away their pay to fund the mining. Alt LOTR
36. And women choosing what happens with their bodies and lives?! Socialism, clearly…./s
37. People: Let's put Aussies first! Great! I totally agree! Ok, dental into medicare, taxing the rich, $.50 public transport and $1000 free electricity People: Wait, no not like that! That costs money! Yes - tax payer money that we're spending... on... the... tax payers....? People: NO SOCIALISM BAD!!! NOT LIKE THAT!!
38. How many buses do you catch? Plus, if we were really wanting to enhance socialism, wouldn't it be better for us to concentrate on getting the cost of living under control? Maybe reducing grocery costs etc? That way, it's fairer for everyone and a full-price bus fare isn't such a big deal.
39. They will never build a nuclear plant. I will go and buy a new hat just to eat if they do.
40. Simples mate, just stop going to the doctor or visiting hospitals, show those pesky conservative AMA members you won't be trifled with!
41. Stalking my comments I see! Convincing two people who are stupid enough to listen to you is not the flex you think it is. I hope you got them How to Vote cards in case they couldn't count to 7.
42. If you raise less revenue from royalties you need to either tax people more, or decrease government services.. what did I miss
43. Ok, go find a way to reduce grocery prices. Until you have that worked out, until you have that worked out 50c should stay
44. I catch buses frequently, there is a stop at the end of my street, and the 50c fares have significantly reduced my travel costs. I agree that waving a magic wand to reduce grocery costs would be a wonderful idea. But unfortunately our government is not a magician. There are so many facets that go into the pot when it comes to grocery prices, and a lot of it cannot be affected at a state level, only federally.
45. LOL - an alt with -100 karma and 24 hours old - what a knob.
46. Totally. The Right’s repeated failure to make it a major issue in Australia is slightly reassuring.
47. Good attempt, but you've missed a HUGE amount. QLD charging the highest royalties in the country has meant that new mining leases have been either abandoned or avoided. One example was the Glencore mine which was going to tip $2b into the QLD economy. That's thousands of jobs, plus a massive stimulus resultant from the spending, including local services. The stimulus more than offsets the royalties and, therefore, strengthens the economy and gives confidence to the companies that QLD is a good place to invest. Even this is only a small part of it.
48. How many buses do you catch? None. You're just taking a pretty thinly veiled swipe. Quite childish, really
49. And when youth crime stays the same you are gonna blame Labor for it because it is always Labour's fault isn't it. I am gonna laugh so hard when the LNP fuck you over. Guess what Labour lives for free in your head
50. So if we got be minerals away for nothing, we will have no problem getting investments... Are you sponserd by glencorp. Sometimes Australia needs to stop being such a push over with its mineral wealth. Australia is a great place to invest, so we should charge a royalty according to that.
51. If anyone else reads this thread.... We should not be subsidising Glencore. https://www.crikey.com.au/2018/05/07/australias-no-1-tax-dodger/
52. ?? You said governments should focus on reducuing grocery prices, I would suggest that's pretty hard for them to do. 50c fares though.easy.
53. Have you seen your unhinged sub. It's delicious! You guys are true cookers. What an echo chamber you live in.
54. I don't work in mining. I do, however, have considerable understanding of economics and poor govt policy surrounding it. There was no reason to increase the royalties to the levels they did except for the fact that they couldn't manage the portfolio effectively. In turn, they scared off investors which then punched a huge hole in the economy. To take your comment further, Australia SHOULD be a good place to invest, particularly QLD. We are the most resource rich state in Australia, not just in mining but also environment, but we have had a socialist government in office for far too long now who prefer to generate jobs creation data via expansion in the public service than actual jobs creation in real life. Then they are forced into taxes and tarrifs to offset their spending and fiscal irresponsibility. We can't even get our financial sectors in the SE on the same time zone as the rest of the east coast as risk of fading the curtains 🙄
55. That is up to the ATO and the Federal Government to manage. The QLD Govt is not responsible for taxing multi-nationals.
56. And that benefits only those who catch buses. How is that good en masse?
57. Typical Dunning Kruger, think they know everything when they know fuck all of nothing.
58. Royalties are only half the problem. Government departments deliberately dragging their feet on approvals, assessments and compliance requirements is a big factor in why mining is leaving for international opportunities. Sovereign risk for business in Australia has reached unacceptable levels. 15 years ago I'd laugh at you for suggesting we'd get here.
59. I’m 100% on your side & I’ll paste a comment I made to someone arguing basically the same point: *I’m all for resources paying royalties, but it needs to be in moderation & universal across all the different resource sectors... To allow a fair market, can you tell me why it’s good to impose heavy royalties on coal & nothing else, all because ‘coal is bad’ as a widespread consensus? I’ve worked in coal, l’ve also owned shares in coal companies (I no longer own them fyi, before you say my argument is invalid), so l’d say I have an alternative perspective to the average uninformed person and the fact of the matter is, coal companies have extremely high operational costs, especially for new ventures/expansion, considering that 70% of production is moving dirt & not mining coal, additionally most coal mining companies own multiple mines, but often very few are profitable, so they use the profitable mines to cover the losses of the others, weather events are an extremely costly event to coal mining too (very common in FNQ). Also most coal mines have lifetime contracts with Stanwell (QLD Gov owned coal power plants) to supply thermal coal at low fixed prices & at set sufficient quantities. So keeping all this in mind, do you agree it’s fair to only implement heavy royalties on coal & no other resources? At the end of the day, the main people that suffer are the coal mine workers, through increased excessive demand for work output, cutting contractors/subcontractors to lower expenses & cutting corners safety wise to increase productivity, it’s already dangerous enough out there as it is... Also keep in mind that Stanwell used to own some coal mines in QLD, including Curragh coal mine (the mine l worked at). The QLD Labor government during the 2000’s decided to sell that mine (among others) to a private entity, while maintaining dedicated thermal coal supply and royalties, which have increased over time. The fact that people think Labor are a godsend for the people and collecting royalties from coal companies is a new practice, is highly uninformed & shows how gullible people are with their election campaign tactics. The fact of the matter is, that coal companies have been paying royalties to the QLD government for a long time and have just increased them lately to compensate for their horrible financial mismanagement. I’m actually a little disappointed that punters politics didn’t do his homework on the subject. The LNP isn’t striving to remove coal royalties, but instead repeal the recent increases, as some mining companies are really suffering as a result.
60. Labor government = socialist. Ok, serious economist. Tariffs? States can't levy tariffs. Agree about daylight savings. FFS, Qld needs to get with the program.
61. You bought up the Glencore example. I pointed out they are tax cheats and probably wouldn't be paying much of anything without royalties. So their reasoning for cancelling is probably not true and they are lying.
62. Trains, buses ferries. Less people in cars, less traffic for others. Less road maintenance. Marginal cases where people can reduce number of cars (saving heaps). People have more money in their pocket to spend on other things. Maintaining cars/roads also cost a bundle
63. Like the LNP and Murdoch does in yours.... keep going though we are all enjoying your tantrums. 😊
64. Agreed. And that is on both sides of Parliament, not just one party.
65. Great comments. Climate alarmism is a great way to increase taxes. Since 1967 there have been 41 climate disaster predictions. Of those 41, not a single prediction has been experienced. NONE. There is no more effective way for Govt's to control a population than to generate fear. The most recent example of this was Labor's election campaign and the message that if the LNP were elected then they would ban abortions. It was brilliant. It was an out and it lie, but it was brilliant, and hats off to the party strategists for the play. It saved them from a complete annihilation. And they knew that people wouldn't go and fact check to find the truth, they would just take the message on face value.
66. Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that. - George Carlin
67. Check the sub you are in, because it is pretty big news if you are a Queenslander
68. 100% mate! I could go one for hours about the abortion scare campaign… The climate crisis is definitely over exaggerated… What people don’t realise, is that when there is actual completely factual evidence of a climate catastrophe, the whole world instantly reacts… For example; the hole in the ozone layer, which was caused by worldwide use of CFC’s. Once the data was proven that it is damaging the ozone layer & the cause was identified, every nation on earth made an agreement to instantly phase out use of CFC’s & transition to HFC’s instead. The result? The hole in the ozone layer shrinking & damage being reversed, even to this day. The argument that carbon in the atmosphere causes global warming is backed by science. But the narrative is far from true. Just another avenue for mass capitalist profits. There is plenty of data showing that land based natural carbon capturing is exceeding our output & actually increases over time, then there is also blue carbon capture (ocean based) that is another variable to calculate and add… Unfortunately whenever data is released contesting the the main narrative, it is censored or the scientists lose credibility & funding.
