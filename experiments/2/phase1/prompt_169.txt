Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. I guess we’ll have to wait and find out. But we know Labor clearly couldn’t do it so it’s certainly fair to give the (now ex) opposition a crack
2. \> Lol, does your dad slip you a bit of tongue everytime you respond to someone with that? You really think I'd bother engaging with someone with this level of maturity and intellect?
3. Too little, too late. It's not as though the cost of living crisis popped up overnight. It's been a reality for at least 2 years that has been worsened by inaction at all levels of government.
4. Labor makes all the debt, then the lnp has to pay it off. Happens every time.
5. Trust me, I'm not worked up at all. Just here for the ridiculous overreactions from people who haven't lived through enough democratic elections to understand that their worlds won't suddenly come crashing down.
6. Labor brings in the migrants. Liberal cuts the services. Two sides of the same coin my friend.
7. I'm like my community enough to not want people forced to be locked down. It's glad to know how much you hate your community that you don't want to give people the freedom to choose
8. That's a shame but people still shouldn't have been forced to be locked down
9. No one is forcing you to stay in qld now that the LNPs in power
10. Not the whole world. Doesn’t change the fact that theft of freedom is an abomination. Should not have happened, should never happen again.
11. Feeding hungry kids, giving energy rebates to QLD families doing it tough and subsidising affordable public transport to reduce traffic. What a hellhole he’s turned QLD into /s
12. Their campaign literally had nothing of substance. It infuriates me that this went over so many people’s heads
13. I study these things daily. What do you do? Oh, you listen to ALP spin?
14. I know…? Except you weren’t the original comment were you? The original comment said stuffing around with abortion rights is ‘firmly on the table’. I asked where, you chimed in with KAP intends to test the government. That’s not stuffing around with abortion rights firmly on the table. That’s not on the table at all. And even if he ‘tested the government’ which is now an LNP majority government (see, here’s where the LNP comes in), it would be a resounding failure. So it’s not firmly on the table by any metric. It’s a labour fear mongering campaign, plain and simple.
15. Ah okay, you’re just against the UN Rights of the Child, all good obviously I’m going to do nothing to convince you. Hope you have a good rest of your day
16. I didn't list everything, just examples. Please read a book on political theory anyway and get outta my replies, lol.
17. It’s not like we’ve picked someone at random and given them a turn. We know the LNPs ideology and policies and should be making an informed choice based on that. Labor didn’t do a perfect job but there is absolutely no indication that the LNP will do any better.
18. Bruh you have no idea whether labour could fix it or not, you've just given Queensland the Tasmania treatment lol, please enjoy toasting marshmallows on the ashes of your kids futures.
19. Just say it bro. You voted for lnp because you always have but have no actual idea of their policies or mandate. It’s ok.
20. "Those Social Democrats couldn't fix Deutschland's problems, so might as well give that Austrian guy a crack" Germans, 1933
21. The $1000 we all got for our electricity bills didn't help at all, I suppose. Basically almost entirely free public transport didn't help? Satellite hospitals? Mining royalties bringing money to the people instead of corporations? There's more but come on.
22. > asks a question > dodges question twice > can you answer my question tho? > "YoU'rE iMmATuRe" No wonder you're an LNP voter. All you're good for is dodging questions and throwing insults.
23. >Copium I dunno man, you don't seem the sort for maturity or intellect.
24. So voting in the party that won’t address at all is the solution then, ok got it.
25. You've just made a song and dance about people's lives - the homeless - that have come crashing down due to poor government performance lol Also easy for your to say when topics like abortions are on the line and women's lives can and will come crashing down around them when they can't get life saving healthcare
26. Last time the lnp got in Queensland 25,000 people suddenly lost their jobs, abortion is likely to be banned and mining royalties will be cut.. There is plenty of room for worry here dipshit.
27. Rights must be balanced in a just society. I struggle to think of how the rights of tens of thousands of people to *not die* is worth less than the temporary restriction of your ability to go outside. You sound like the kind of person who does things because you have a "right" to do them, even if you shouldn't. Human beings are cooperative animals. We must cooperate to survive. This sometimes requires sacrifice. If you can't even stay inside for a bit, then how could you handle ever being asked to make a serious sacrifice?
28. Interesting. I was originally annoyed at your comment, but now I'm just curious. How would you feel if the mortality rate was higher? What if it was 50%? If you caught it, you'd have a 50% survivability rate...
29. All you can do is attempt to educate and pray you cut through the noise.
30. “Study” i.e. reading Facebook comments on “articles” posted by Murdoch-backed media. Well done champ.
31. Not sure you understand how a democracy works. A party who is in power for several years and fails to address key issues among the voting public \*should\* be voted out. Political bias aside, the alternative wouldn't be good for anyone.
32. … And there’s every indication ALP won’t do any better. That’s the key point you’re not understanding
33. I think first hand experience shows Labor is incapable of fixing it, in fact it’s only gotten worse. But yeah be a doomer all you want
34. I didn’t vote for LNP bro. Cheers and if you want something to go with your salt I recommend vinegar
35. Yeah, nah didn’t happen like that. But appreciate the tears
36. How do any of those things help the people living in tents because their rent increased by 60%?
37. I tried to be an NBA basketballer once upon a time. So long as I tried hey?
38. \> You've just made a song and dance about people's lives - the homeless - that have come crashing down due to poor government performance lol That wasn't sudden. It was through years of mismanagement of the housing situation that was exposed during the COVID mass migration. Perhaps if Labor had addressed the shortages there wouldn't be a need for a song and dance. \> Also easy for your to say when topics like abortions are on the line and women's lives can and will come crashing down around them when they can't get life saving healthcare Zero evidence that this will be the case. I'm no LNP fan but I'm equally not a fan of scare campaigns that prey on the most gullible in society.
39. Why did my comment annoy you? Attitude remains the same. It is not the governments role to lock you up at home. Theft of freedom is an abomination. This will never change. It is up to the personal risk tolerance of the individuals, not the government, to determine when and if they decide to go outside. The mortality rate of the threat is not relevant in this belief. The governments job is to inform - and they failed this as well, miserably, but that’s another conversation entirely. Theft of freedom will always be an abomination. It has no place in a free nation.
40. Financial reports, production reports, and globally supply and demand forecasts. Meanwhile you're getting your opinion from the r/Queensland mouth breathers.
41. Unfortunately neoliberalism will never address those key issues in any meaningful way. But we had a choice between a party that was making incremental improvements vs one that will gleefully reverse course.
42. So you voted out a party attempting to fix something and voted in the party with no plans (policies) to fix anything. Gotcha. Sound logic.
43. But plenty to say the LNP will do significantly worse.
44. In what way? Queensland, like pretty much the entire country is still recovering from a global economic downturn and the after effects of Covid, and they've done fantastically. I grew up in Tasmania, I know exactly what having an LNP government gets you. I'll tell you right now, it isn't a better cost of living situation, or a better healthcare system, or housing situation.
45. I suspect the LNP's planned $45m cut to homelessness services certainly won't help. However, hopefully the LNP can somehow fix the global cost of living crisis by giving away our natural resources for almost nothing (and that means the taxpayer must either pay for more things or receive less things).
46. The majority. What do you think the LNP will do to help the people in tents? I didn’t see any policy directed that way.
47. Do you seriously think that is a QLD Labor induced issue? Do you know what their plans were to help address this? Better still, do you know what the LNP plans are? Do you think they'll do anything about the out of control rental market? The Liberals ran a federal scare campaign based on Labor wanting to reign in negative gearing (which would have absolutely helped). This is the wrong horse to bet on to even get near helping people out. You might want to look at the Federal Liberals regarding the wage stagnation that put us all in a much worse position... Look how far back it goes.
48. “Well they e been there too long let’s give the other guys a chance even though we know how badly they stuffed it up last time” is certainly a take
49. First, you're moving the goalposts, and you were objectively wrong with your first point. Secondly, the LNP has been in power for the majority of the time we've had that debt. Like I said, dude, under a rock. Stop mindlessly believing propaganda.
50. Fuck man how'd you move the goal posts all the way over there when my back was turned
51. > was making incremental improvements Evidently the improvements were too small, too late and not making enough of a difference to the lives of the voting population. That's how a democracy works.
52. Based only on opinions, not actual real lived experience. I always prefer reality over unfounded opinions, but you do you. In either case we’ll both have to wait and see. That’s just the… wait for it… reality
53. Cool, so Tassie can vote them out then? And correction: it’s not the after effects of Covid per se, it’s the after effects of governmental response to Covid, of which Labor was terrible (repeated lockdowns, restrictions etc forced money to be printed … and here we are, paying for it). So your argument appears to be that a government who stuffs up and then tries (but fails) to get things back to levels prior to their stuff up has done “fantastically”. Tell me more. (Don’t)
54.

55. Lesson being never trust anyone who identifies as a socialist?
56. And seemingly a more popular take than “labor’s had 9 years and things are getting worse, but this time I reckon they’ll get it right”
57. The bottom line is MrRock that in 2015 Qld net debt was a bit under $11B and today it is $26B. So the QLP has increased net debt by $15B in 9 years or $1.6B a year. I'm not moving any goalposts, the Qld Labor Party were & unfortunately it's in a downward direction. It is critical for our states health that the goalposts are not put six feet under.
58. No dog in the race, but there was no goal post shifting. They answered your points and didn't shift the discussion at all. If you can't be actively involved in discourse then don't engage in it.
59. What are the LNP going to do to address the cost of living and housing crisis?
60. Did you not live through the Newman horror show? I did and that lived experience was unbelievable... Of which Crisafulli was a member of. He's got a track record already and it's terrible.
61. I don’t need to wait and see if the LNP will favour privatisation, slash public jobs, and suck up to the mineral council.
62. >Cool, so Tassie can vote them out then? Tassies a retirement village, nothing will change. >it’s the after effects of governmental response to Covid, You mean the Federal Liberal government response? I mean they were in power until almost midway through 2022, the cost of living crisis, poor healthcare funding and inflation were all Federal responsibility. >So your argument appears to be that a government who stuffs up and then tries (but fails) to get things back to levels prior to their stuff up has done “fantastically”. My argument is that you're blaming state Labour for Fed Liberal caused issues, and you don't seem to understand that even with the liberals trying their level best to actively fuck the country into the ground, Queensland is absolutely objectively in a better position than they would have been under LNP.
63. I honestly don't know how people like you function, but it might be representative of the average LNP voter that they just swallow what they're told without doing the most basic research. Queensland & WA have been the best performing states when it comes to reducing public sector debt and both were done under Labor, just as Labor has been performing better than the LNP at a federal level. It's all easily researchable, make a coffee and spend a few hours, and maybe you'll change your mind, but I doubt it, and I'm wasting my time arguing with you.
64. I appreciate the skepticism, we should always be skeptical of all politicians and we should never ever stick to one party. Don’t you agree?
65. In fairness none of that, especially slashing public jobs, is necessarily a bad thing. But I can tell by the tone of your comment your mind is already made up. What a sad existence to be so determined to be so stubborn. An open mind makes an open life, feel free to try it.
66. Federal LNP government I was no fan of, but don’t pretend the huge majority of restrictions weren’t Labor state based decisions. And it’s not “absolutely objectively”, it’s “absolutely subjectively”. I don’t understand why labor types think they can decide their opinion is fact
67. Unlike you, i did the research. I read the balance sheet from the auditor general from when pallachook was elected to this last budget. I think you represent the other side extremely well. Shooting off at the mouth will your head wedged up your arse while doing alap.
68. You do what you like. As for me, I'm judging the book by the pages I've already read.
69. >What a sad existence to be so determined to be so stubborn. What's the line about keeping an open mind, but not so open your brain falls out? Feels rather fitting here.
70. >Federal LNP government I was no fan of, but don’t pretend the huge majority of restrictions weren’t Labor state based decisions. And those Labour decisions objectively saved lives. >And it’s not “absolutely objectively”, it’s “absolutely subjectively”. I don’t understand why labor types think they can decide their opinion is fact What are you even talking about? It's only subjective if you ignore reality. Youth crime is at its lowest rate, down 18% since 2012/13 in Queensland. Like, have a cry mate, but don't kid yourself about anything coming out of your mouth being true. Congrats, you owned the woke left labour government, now you get to watch the Liberals strip your social services, your environmental protections, destroy the great barrier reef and sell national assets to the highest bidder lol.
71. Brother I posted a meme and you chowed down on it with a rant. I'm sitting here watching the UFC and you keep lighting up my notifications
72. Wise words, though I’d rather risk a bit of openness than live in an echo chamber
73. All of which is your subjective opinion. And to be clear your opinions mean SFA. Oh and yes, those Labor decisions also objectively cost lives. But feel free to cherry pick. Oh look, you already have. Standard
74. Yawn. Performative civility in bad faith invitations. I avoided your question, I didn't answer it. You'd know that if you were asking it with any actual sincerity. You can be sad for me all you like, it's a waste of time but go ahead and waste your time.
75. Heeding warnings based on historical precedent, policy promises and what we know to be true and likely outcomes of the implementation of said policies, is not living in an echo chamber. Although looking at your post history concerning Covid and vaccines, this all becomes far clearer. You're not open-minded, you just believe yourself to be a deeper, more critical thinker than you really are. Good luck with that.
76. >All of which is your subjective opinion. Not at all, but I can understand how hard it would be for a liberal to figure out the difference between subjective and objective, you guys have always been more concerned with feelings than reality. > yes, those Labor decisions also objectively cost lives An infinitely smaller amount than Covid would have claimed if it had been allowed to run rampant through an unvaccinated community, and you know that, but you want to pretend like there's some level of parity there.
77. lol had a look at yours too. Timeline goes something like this: - got 3 jabs - got Covid - got at least one more jab (ignoring warnings based on historical precedent) - got Covid AGAIN lol at least one more time - despite the above, goes on to argue for mandatory jabs for healthcare workers because they definitely work - thinks everyone else isn’t open minded The brain fog is real. Meanwhile, no Covid here :-) I can smell your dissonance. Good luck with that.
78. 1. Not a liberal. Never have been never will be. Or any other party. Objective fact. Cope. 2. [Open this graph](https://imgur.com/a/j2Kgmzs). Mark a line on it when approximately most people in Australia got jabbed. Then revisit your comment and realise how retarded it sounds. bUt it wOuLd hAvE bEeN wOrSe. Says who? The TV? Your moronic political party? Your feelings? Wake up
79. I think I’ve mentioned my own experience, what, two or three times however long I’ve been on Reddit? And the ‘at least one more jab’ was based entirely on precedent, since the vaccines likely played a role in just how minor the first infection was (as evidence shows is widely the case). Anyway, I’ll continue to defer to the expertise of the overwhelming majority of medical professionals - and, you know, evidence - since it’s clear neither of us are qualified in this area, and you don’t even seem to know what it is vaccines are designed to achieve. And you do you.
80. So you're just an anti-vax idiot. Way to blow any legitimacy your arguments had. Have you spent years studying virology? Conducted many double-blind studies? Excuse me if I don't find your afternoon of 'research' on Google and YouTube compelling evidence.
81. >1. Not a liberal. Never have been never will be. Or any other party. Objective fact. Cope. He says while actively dickriding the liberal party so hard they're collectively worried about ending up with broken hips. 2. Open this graph. Mark a line on it when approximately most people in Australia got jabbed. Then revisit your comment and realise how retarded it sounds. The graph doesn't help you though? You do realise that even the initial Pfizer and Astra-zeneca vaccines were astoundingly effective at protecting against death and serious illness from Covid right? Your graph literally shows that by the time we had a majority of the population vaccinated (before December in 2021) lockdowns, masking and social distancing were insanely effective stopping covid deaths and infection, and that even with a high vaccination rate covid was still deadly enough to kill 25k people per year since lockdowns ended. >bUt it wOuLd hAvE bEeN wOrSe. Says who? The TV? Your moronic political party? Your feelings? Wake up Pretty much every single global health organisation, medical association, and its the current consensus in virology and infectious disease specialists. Are you stupid? RFK jr isn't going to marry you bud.
82. Haha yeah the old “I got multiple jabs but then I got Covid but it could have been worse!” chestnut. Followed by the almighty “so then I got another jab and then I got Covid again yes these jabs are sooooo good… it’s science I tells ya!” Makes me laugh. Here I am, couldn’t get Covid if I tried. So yeah, me doing me sounds like a much better idea. I’ll just let you selfishly repeatedly transmit Covid into the community while I enjoy my healthy lifestyle
83. lol have you? Or do you just inject drugs multiple times because you were told to do so. Had Covid yet?
84. Haha you think someone making fun of leftwit drug addicts is liberal dickriding? Your tears are extra salty this morning, recommend you have a nice rest
85. Mate I have treated COVID. It's all imaginary to you, but there's real people out there dying while you decide to gut public health on a fairy tale. So if you're not gonna contribute, please fuck right off.
86. >Haha you think someone making fun of leftwit drug addicts is liberal dickriding? Oh yeah, there you go full mask off now you little nazi >Your tears are extra salty this morning, recommend you have a nice rest The salt your tasting isn't from tears, it's the result of all that LNP dickriding. Edit:/
87. Haha and all the people you treat are unvaccinated, right. RIGHT? Of course you’ve had Covid too (after multiple jabs) and are too shit weak to admit it. SMD and have a lovely Sunday
88. Haha not sure what you mean “full mask” but yeah, I can imagine you’d be the type to still be wearing one 😷 How you gonna be next Wednesday? Got a mop for your tears?
89. What are you on about? Do you seriously think that we made up a vaccine for a disease that didn't exist? Yes, I've had COVID, and my symptoms were mild. No one has ever said the vaccine prevents you from getting infected 100%, but there's clear data that it improves outcomes significantly. Queensland had one of the global best responses to the pandemic, and had a blissfully and enviably easy time of it compared to the rest of the world. Do you think that just happened by accident? It's all fun and games until Grandpa is choking on his own lungs — real people do real work to protect the community. Why do you insist on undermining that?
90. >Haha not sure what you mean “full mask” but yeah, I can imagine you’d be the type to still be wearing one Lol yeah that's not what I said but okay >How you gonna be next Wednesday? Got a mop for your tears? Why? Crying men the only way you can cum?
91. As I’ve not had Covid you can’t accuse me of passing it on to anyone. Unlike you…
92. Yeah that’s [literally what you said](https://imgur.com/a/3aXGeRc). Why do you hate facts so much? Because they make you look like a FW?
93. Not a great argument mate, I'm the one actually engaging with the recommended precautions. Also, Google 'asymptomatic carrier'. If it was always obvious who was spreading the virus we wouldn't have been in such a mess. Why do you think you know better than the united global science community??? Certainly got plenty of self-esteem.
94. Lol I missed an F bruh, if that's your idea of a powerful refutation maybe you should just put the phone down and focus on your job servicing gloryholes. >Why do you hate facts so much? You haven't presented any, you've just spent the entire time dickriding the party of reactionary babies.
95. Actual science gets questioned all the time, despite what your propaganda tells you it’s not a united community. Yeah pretty sure I’ve got the asymptomatic flu right now. And an asymptomatic sore back. Had an asymptomatic headache last week. And Covid is so scary that you hope I’ve had it… it’s just that I didn’t know it. Would have been better if I was vaccinated! Speaking of which now I have asymptomatic long-COVID together with an asymptomatic vaccine injury. Lol want me to keep going? You don’t realise how retarded your replies sound. You killed grandpa, not me. Cope.
96. You missed an “f” when you said “full mask”? Ffull mask? Full masfk? Lol you keep digging that hole of yours, glory or not
