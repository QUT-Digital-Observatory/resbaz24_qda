Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. I live in a regional city and there are several primary schools with over 1000 students. These size primary schools are fairly common. I work at a school with half that and it would still be hell on earth to supply those free lunches. To create that food they would have to build a whole new tuck shop and hire several new people to run it and even then the time it would take to distribute each day to kids in prep, 1 and 2 would be insane. When there is a birthday and we have to hand out slices of cake to prep kids, it can take half an hour. Where are we going to find the time to do that three times in the day. Prep, 1s and 2s would also likely drop a plate, some don’t know how to use a fork. There are also no tables to sit at, just benches. It would likely mean the kids loosing out on at least an hour of learning to make it happen. There just isn’t the time in the school day. I love the idea, but it was said in the moment with no consultation with schools and no plan on how to practically deliver it on the ground. Oh and it was meant to start term 1 next year. As if the new facilities would be built by then.
2. In the Sunny coast, quite a few of our state primary schools have over 1000 kids. Talara, Buderim, Coolum, Peregian, Baringa to name a few. Of course it’s optional but most parents would take advantedge of it at various points throughout the year. I would imagine Fridays would be a pretty popular day. I don’t think it’s a bad idea, would just be hard to navigate at organise at big schools.
3. Goomeri P10 State School Kilkivan P-10 State School Wondai P-9 State School Yarraman P-9 State school Woodford P-10 State School Dirranbandi P-10 State School Tin Can Bay P-10 State School Texas P-10 State School Allora P-10 State School Injune P-10 State School Alpha P-10 State School Aramac P-10 State School Baralaba P10 State School Bell P-10 State School Biggenden P-10 State School Cecil Plains P9 State School Crows Nest P10 State School Dimbulah P-10 State School Doomadgee P-10 State School Herberton P-10 State School Inglewood P-10 State School Injune P10 State School Jandowae P-10 State School Killarney P-10 state school Kowanyama P10 State School Mary valley state college (P10) Millmerran p10 State School Miriam Vale P10 State School Mitchell P10 State School Mornington Island P10 State School Mount Larcom p-10 State School Mundubbera P10 State School Normanton P-10 State School Proston P10 State School Quilpie State School (P10) Quinalow P10 State School Richmond state school (P10) Springsure P10 Surat P10 Tambo P10 Taroom P10 Theodore P10 Wallumbilla P10 Wandoan P10 Yarrabah P10 Those are just the P9 and P10 schools. P12s include an awful lot of very, very large schools. And no, lots of rural schools literally have tuckshop once a week or a fortnight and only what the P&C parents provide. Lots of rural schools don’t have the facilities to make food at school.
4. Who the fuck said death? I’m talking about surviving financially. Context clues.
5. How much have power prices gone up in the past 4 years?
6. More like wine... I'm celebrating tonight with the majority of QLD.
7. I've been assaulted twice, I know youth crime. Methed up bogans yup.
8. Yes. Cashed up bogans on the GC voting with no conscience
9. As a frequent user of public transport, my transport expenditure went from small but significant, to virtually non-existent under them, so that was pretty good for cost of living.
10. Will the LNP make them go down? No. Could Labour? No. The world is on the brink of war. Those things aren't going to just improve But LNP will fuck with abortion laws and cut necessary services such as drug diversion. Fucking idiots
11. This ^ Anyone who thinks any politician regardless of party actually cares needs to take a step back.
12. That’s completely different and you know it. Leaving your doors and windows open is completely stupid and the perfect way to let someone in and by the way this isn’t a new thing there’s always been people who would take advantage of the access.
13. It could be just as good as the US healthcare system.
14. You want a magic bus way to be built in other areas of the state? With your "whataboutism" nothing would ever improve for anyone unless it could improve for everyone at the same time. Which if you have half a brain you'll know isn't possible.
15. You want to take something away from group A that benefits them because group B can’t access it? Do you realise how fucked that is?
16. Yeah man those mining royalties that paid for so many benefits really knocked the stuffing outta ordinary Qlders..
17. No problem. Happy to help you apply if you need!
18. So they claim. Not all rural places would be able to accommodate it is the point.
19. Sorry, my bad... I was stuck on the long-standing policy of the Greens with breakfast. Still does not change anything... as schools already provide hot school lunches. They just accept payment for them. Has no one against this ever had tuckshop before or something?
20. Go watch some videos on Japan schools. They provide lunch for the school kids and have no problems at all. Kids in the class room, whilst waiting for their meal they tidy up the classroom to pre pare for the meal. The teacher dishes up the meals. And they all sit and eat together including the teacher. Yes there will be hurdles but it will be worth it. Not only does it insure all kids get a meal a school it's also helps parents as they no longer have to worry about having the money / food for their kids lunch. It will also teach kids responsibility and some basic respect.
21. No, they're not. Name them. Because we can check the enrolment numbers as they're public. I know Sunnybank Hills is one of the most populated state primary schools and they have 1,500 something students... but that's not a regional school, that's in a city. That's not the norm. I'm in Townsville atm, a large regional city... and so far none over 1,000 students. Logically... regional state schools would not have greater numbers than metropolitan schools... because the populations are way smaller. So again... say the name of the state school, we can check them. Also, tuckshop isn't delivered 'on a plate' - Not unless you're in a private school (Do they do that?). In my primary school in the 00s, you got it in a brown paper bag (the same one you wrote your order on) and you ate it with your hands. Why would it happen 3 times a day? Damn dude, are you talking about private schools? Because in state schools you have 1 lunch break (longer) and then 1 afternoon tea (shorter). State school tuckshops tend to be staffed by volunteers, usually parents of the children. I volunteered at the primary school tuckshop for my work experience in highschool, and we successfully and (very easily) cooked about 200+ hot meals a day. It wasn't a 3 course meal bro... it was things like cheese toasties, hot pies, sausage rolls and chips. I wish I went to your school as a kid though. 😂 3 lunches! Birthday cake! Plates and cutlery! Damn.
22. Yea, to name a few. That's the point. There are over 900 primary state schools in QLD. Some schools would need more resources to roll it out, but presumably, they've still been providing hundreds of orders of tuckshop food a day already... it really wouldn't be that big of a difference. My former state primary school had 800 children. When I volunteered for tuckshop, me and 2 other volunteers easily provided about 200+ hot lunches a day. You're not using an easy bake oven, or making 3 course meals. I'm not sure where people are seeing 'hot lunches' though... all the articles I've read just say 'lunches' - So even easier!
23. All those schools don't even have many students...? Kilkivan only has 62 students over Primary??? There are only 94 Primary + Secondary schools... so 10% of schools. So you want to not give lunches to 90% of state schools because 10% of schools have Primary + Secondary together? That seems super fucked up dude.
24. Unfortunately you're laughing at the slop they would eat without seeing a menu, so I already know that providing you with info is not gonna change your mind. No point wasting my time on you. Call up the services or headspace but fuckoff if you wanna question it without looking into it yourself
25. Still cheapest in Australia my man. It’s all comparative. Also we have the best solar rebates too. Or had. Might be cut now.
26. How much less has power prices gone up in Queensland compared to other states?
27. Sure bud, you and gina rinehardt the KFC miner must be having fun.
28. I'm so sorry you've been assaulted. Especially to be assaulted twice. That's so horrible. I hope you didn't have major injuries and you're doing okay now. I've been sexually assaulted before and the Labor coercive control law changed my life. It gave me freedom.
29. The sad part is it’s not even the cashed up people (bogan or otherwise) voting LNP here. It’s people who perceive themselves to be cashed up. People are voting against their own interests, with know idea that they are shooting themselves in the foot. There are people voting to have their own kids locked up, which they’ll realise once it’s too late.
30. Yup unfortunately my area now. Live in a suburb that was full of young families, young couples and single people years ago and is now overrun with boomers, who vote LNP (and was proven in the results) I hate it here
31. It really isn't. Stop tryinging to justify yourself. Breaking in isn't legal because a door is open just like it's not legal to take advantage of a woman because of her "asking for it". Your words in regards to leaving the door unlocked was they would be asking for it. Don't back away now. You used the phrase own up to it.
32. I personally think that introducing public transport that connects more of the state would help disperse the population which we need to do. I personally think that an investment in high speed rail connecting regional centres with Brisbane would be a worthwhile investment that perhaps would have shown regions that Labor actually values them and that also makes regional centres a more attractive place to live.
33. It did affect mining towns, companies canceled expansion and didn’t renew contracts. Just because city dwellers don’t see youth crime and lack of infrastructure and investment doesn’t mean they aren’t an issue. Labor have just realised they can’t focus on the city and neglect rural and still win an election. Have a look at the election map, labor won Brisbane city and outliers and almost no other. Let this be a lesson to both majors that you can’t forget the rural electorates.
34. I should be able to manage it, thanks. But if I can't, I'll get back to you. (There's so many times as someone with ADHD, I'd swipe on and forget to swipe off travelling one zone so they charged me maximum).
35. On the contrary, I’m on a committee that runs our school tuckshop. I know how much more infrastructure we would need to serve a hot lunch to 700 kids a day (as opposed to the 150 a day who order a mix of sandwiches, snacks and minimal hot food, and we are only opened 4 days a week). The upfront capital cost would be massive, and a complete waste compared to the infrastructure our school actually needs. We would need a lot more employees (volunteers are hard to come by as it is), which would also increase the costs over and above what we already have per item. Lastly we are in a demographic that definitely does not need this type of handout and it concerns me that this will not address the true reasons kids are going to school hungry, but will give free things to those that have plenty already.
36. Where did I say I didn’t want to give lunches? I’m merely pointing out that the actual policy doesn’t take into account the wide variation of school types in QLD, and the fact that these schools cannot afford to provide food for their secondary students out of their budget, and that in rural schools they don’t actually have capacity to offer tuckshop so how will they do this? It was made very clear that there would be no additional staffing allocation to schools to support this. And positioning people actually in schools who point out their concerns with this policy as “not wanting to feed children” is ridiculous posturing. I mean, how is a school tuckshop like Kelvin Grove State College’s supposed to prepare 1500 meals for its primary while ALSO preparing orders for its secondary, and have all the necessary recruitment and infrastructure expansion completed by January? How was the Miles government going to complete this expansion by January when schools have holidays in 6 weeks and therefore principals and business managers are not working?
37. That's right comparative to the rest of the world. We can't manufacture anything here because we are not competitive on a world stage. Largely due to energy costs despite being blessed with ample land and some of the best natural resources in the world.
38. Yeah, I wish so bad I could just be able to buy a chunk of land somewhere and make my own town where you can't be a right wing nutjob, and where only non fuckwits live. I'd love to. But instead, I have to listen to Nancy on the bus tell us how one of her friends got broken into 2 years ago and how her cigarettes' are so expensive.
39. I don’t need to make all of my own mistakes, I can learn from others mistakes.
40. Look, obstensibly I agree with you. I am a huge fan of trains. But high speed rail is expensive so they aren't going to build it to regional areas with low uptake. Primarily because this kind of stuff is build on demand. People have to move there first, but people won't move there first if there's no mass public transport. Chicken and egg etc. There's been talking of high speed rail between sydney and melbourne for ... decades? And they won't even do that...
41. People who aren't billionaires. The Miles government actually did what a government is supposed to do and used the mining royalties to go towards queenslanders. It supported the many, not the few.
42. Ha! Watch lnp not spend in rural areas because they've got an Olympics to deliver
43. Fair comment I suppose. Whether I agree with the result or not is irrelevant. People outside the cities are feeling left out and have voted for a change of government accordingly. It's just disappointing that some of the more progressive policies will be shelved but in a lot of rural areas no one gives a shit about 50 cent fares when there's no public transport and you feel you need to lock your house now.
44. Yeah, I used ADHD and ASD as mine. Worked well. Good luck!
45. None of the articles say hot lunches. It just says lunches. Can you link me to the policy that specifically says hot lunches? I worked in a tuckshop in the 00s. We easily provided 200+ exclusively hot meals a day for a school of 800 with only 3 people and were open 5 days a week. We also took lunchtime orders, at the same time - Hot food could only be pre-ordered via paper bag order. Now most tuckshops just take pre-orders that have to be in before the first bell. They also don't solely rely on volunteers any more. Children being fed is important infrastructure. I can deal with a kid being slightly less educated in math than underfed and suffering across the board. Obviously you can't and prioritise differently, that's fine. Edit: The QLD government already provides food support programs for school. My nieces school applied for it and they were able to source free food provided by the local Woolworths to give free fruit to the kids. Yay!
46. By propping up non-issues as justification for being against it... that's where I get it from. Your problems have easy solutions, but instead you're just sitting there having a tanty saying "We've tried nothing and we're all out of options!" Rural schools are NOT the majority. Not to be harsh, but they are not the priority. Feeding 90% of kids is better than feeding none because we can't cater to the few. Extra funding can be provided on a needs basis for those *niche* issues, that is extremely common and *normal* for legislation like this. Kelvin Grove only has 967 primary school students. Not sure where you got the 1,500 from. It also appears they have a fantastic tuckshop system to cater to those large amount of students! Wow, who would've thought! Edit: Did you know they have a junior school tuckshop and a senior school tuckshop? Crazy two tuckshops. Mind blowing. They also *pay* people to work there already - Above award rates too! Looks like they've solved your problems themselves before free lunches were even a thing! I've actually volunteered at a school tuckshop. It took us about 20-30 minutes to cook (As in hot food) about 200 meals... because it's not done with a tiny easy bake oven - So even the most basic tuckshop oven will easily cater to those regional schools that average 200 students. Easily funded and installed! To be fair, that was also the average orders we got and we usually had plenty of free time to just sit around and most shelves in the ovens weren't used. There were only ever 3 or less people doing this. You put the hot food in, you set the timer. Done. You take it out. Put the next lot in. Done. Another 30 minutes. Most likely the free food will not be hot food either. Especially since the 'healthy eating' options became a thing in the late 00s. Another edit: Tuckshop orders are also streamlined now. For my niblings, I just use Qkr! and place the order through there and it's ready for them at lunch. Though they can also put an order in before first bell. No orders happen during the lunch break any more. These things get worked out *after* they're proposed. Welcome to the political process, always good to see new faces.
47. That's my MIL, she tells us all the time she doesn't understand how we live in our suburb cause of all the break ins, youth crime and robberies happening (hint it's not happening) yet looking at stats online she lives in the most crime ridden suburb on the GC which is on the southern end. The propaganda is strong here unfortunately.
48. Sounds like you'd like to start a cult and be the thought police? Will you chant "INGSOC" together? It's funny how the people who claim to be more "progressive" are the first ones to come up with these kinds of statements or talk about how much they despise other people.
49. Oh so it's ok to trespass then because the door wasn't shit correctly? Is that your argument?
50. Look at the state election map, blue except for the red Brisbane city cesspool. Why would they shoot themselves in the foot by neglecting their own seats in favour for labor electorates? Rural hold parties to account as we have just witnessed, I think LNP will be a bit smarter than labor.
51. Again, who says I’m against providing school lunches? pointing out that the proposed policy was poorly thought out, didn’t take into account the realities of many schools in QLD, and was not staffed adequately nor was infrastructure thought about in the timelines is legitimate criticism. Are we not allowed to criticise the problematic parts of good ideas?
52. Honestly, just because it's not happening on your street or to you doesn't mean its not happening at all. What are the actual figures? Do you have a big dog? That could be a deterrent. You clearly hate your neighbours so you probably don't talk to them about whether they've had any issues. Drive around late at night afew nights just randomly. Might change your perception. Ignorance is bliss.
53. No I’m saying it’s not breaking in if the doors open it’s trespassing and if you leave your door open that’s plain stupidity. Also comparing stealing to rape is outrageous
54. Because they are cutting mining royalties, so less money to go around, and they still have an Olympics to deliver. And if you looked at the LNPbudget (as vague as it was) they were already spending less in regional areas. Maybe we'll get a kiddy prison for all the under aged criminals .. that'll be good for the economy
55. Because again... you misunderstanding the political process doesn't mean it's poorly thought out. 😂🤣 They've proposed a school lunch initiative. That will then go to legislative process. Which will then be debated and changed in parliament to consider all these things. That. Is. How. Government. Works. It doesn't happen at the start. They don't submit fully organised proposals! It's a process where ALL of this is sorted out. Bloody hell, talk about wanting instant gratification. What is this timeline you're talking about? They made a proposal! There wasn't even legislation yet, which wouldn't have happened until the New Year. Wait... do you think legislation proposals are instant? Like a government proposes something and it's done instantly? It has to go through the political process before it even starts being implemented. It wouldn't even begin for probably a year after that so schools can be upgraded. Have you been thinking this whole time that even when legislation is passed that it begins... immediately? 😐
56. Saw that in the results! All other areas of the GC were blue and they were red. Go on Gaven
57. Looking at actual figures..... Didn't I just say looking at the statistics online..... Because of one comment you assume I hate my neighbours, might have a dog, don't drive around or at night etc etc? Southern GC resident getting pissy as per usual, you know cause we're assuming now. Such big brain over here, ignorance is definitely bliss in your world ✌🏽
58. His press releases and announcements said start of Term 1 2025. His own announcements. That’s the timeline I’m talking about. So by your own admission, he was lying to the electorate, since his promise couldn’t be achieved.
59. >Yup unfortunately my area now. Live in a suburb that was full of young families, young couples and single people years ago and is now overrun with boomers, who vote LNP (and was proven in the results) I hate it here Uhhh??? ^ that's one of your comments. It kinda of implies you hate your neighbours.
60. Also what I meant by actual figure vs stats is, for example, 1 in 10 properties are broken into in this whole suburb. Therefore, this is a high crime area or a red zone. They may say crime has risen by 50% or something like that. However, that data doesn't account for one street being much higher crime than the rest due to things like an abundance of low income housing or high density housing or access to a main road. It doesn't always specify between residential and business break ins either. You can usually get that more specific information from your local neighbourhood watch group if you're interested (if you have one).
61. So here as in the area cause if price gouging on houses and other things, influx of traffic, means I hate my neighbours ..... Ok buddy 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 I hate my neighbours specifically 🙄🙄. That's what you wanna take away from my comment, instead of the influx of propaganda that is getting into people's lives especially the older generation/boomers, you do that
62. My dad and step fil are both ex high up-police, I can get actual statistics and can research it just fine thank you. Stop making assumptions on people from one comment when you don't know shit
63. Yeah you never said anything about any of those other things...You want me to read your mind? I don't have super powers. There has always/will always be propaganda from all sides. It's what politicians do. Boomers aren't falling any harder for the politicians than the young who think they know better but don't necessarily have the wisdom/intelligence they think they have. Youth is arrogant.
64. So you have family in the police force but crime isn't a problem???? Wow. And now I think I've heard it all. Yeah. Goodnight.
65. The real power is with people and that’s what people have decided. If anything Labor & Green want to learn, they must learn why it went south on them and maybe come back with something better for the next time but in the end we must remember it’s the people who have chosen and I just hope they attain what they chose the present government for.
66. Thank god they’re so incompetent it’ll be easy fixing in 28 for the return
67. You’re in a better position than most other states. I can’t believe it took this long to be honest
