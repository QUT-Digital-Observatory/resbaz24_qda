Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. "Massive golf", Trump loves his golf. Early 2000s in Media Studies class at uni the lecturer warned us about Murdoch buying up news outlets and said we need legislation to stop the political threat a media monopoly poses. I don't think I'd go as afar as saying LNP and Trump are aligned, but there are research papers which talk about how simple minds are attracted to conservative ideologies because they are basic and appeal to primal emotions. Progressive and "socialist" policies take a greater than common ignorance undertanding of problems and often a systems thinking approach to really grasp. The problem I see is that whilst the LNP have policies that may benefit only a small percentage of the population, a greater percentage of the population will vote for them in the hope they may one day benefit from them. Negative gearing changes is a great example. Its probably only 9% at most of people who invest in property, but a greater percentage of the population will be swayed on the idea of it. This is where I see us aligning with the US. That NeoLiberal mindset hoping to set up a scenario where we might get rich cause we know one guy with a business or investment who is killing it, whilst at the same time most of the people we know are struggling to pay their rent or mortgage. 30 years ago I'd call myself a libertarian, but life has made me a bit bitter and cynical. The way I see it the capitalist system sees business and government biased in the name of economic productivity. To counter this schools and universities should have a doctrine to teach a socialist bias as a sort of Haegelian Dialectic. We need a collective phychie that this is not a zero sum game and we are all in this together. When you get to the level of managerial finance it becomes all about generating shareholder value as the final decision maker, I did an MBA, that was exactly what the financial subjects teach. You learn corporate social responsibility, but only really as a marketing tool to gain favouring public sentiment. Which is exactly why a party shouldn't be taking political advice from billionaires and CEOs. (I'm looking at you LNP). My great grandfather is recorded on hansard in the 60s saying "as long as we look after our most vulnerable classes, we will never have to worry about communism". That extends to never having to worry about other areas like crime, child abuse, domestic violence etc. We need to have greater conversations around this. The LNP, and Murdoch pushed agenda seems to be the opposite; The easier we make it to get rich, the more prosperious Australia will be. Which is categorically false. It is like trying to find a formula to win the lotto. Only a few people get rich. I see the LNP suffering from the availability bias caused by there echo chamber of lobiests and donors, so they end up thinking XXX is good for Australia because people I'm talking to say it will bring $$$ revenue to the city/region/country. The same happens with groups of mates though. I hear my dad talk about the guy in his car club who has XXX properties and tells everyone they should be doing Y. They listen to everything he says like some sort of guru. But are they really thinking about what would make everyone happier? The next conversation they are all talking about how they miss there kids because they have moved out of the city because they couldn't afford to buy a house there anymore. We need a change in how society views problems and solutions. Australia had a great ideology of a fair go, but that has vanished in the past 30 years. From what I can see for the most part by the LNP doing what they thought would help, but acutally making it worse (for example stimulating the a booming building industry during covid). Things like reddit and youtube have helped a lot. We have generations coming up to vote who will have had friendly jordies indoctrinating them like Rage Against the Machine did for me in the 90s. But from what I've heard from reports from ex murdoch employees we need to the man to die and the organisational cutlure to change. At the end of the day your average bloke is going to buy/read the Murdoch tabloid for the sport and flip to the front and have their world view slightly influenced by the political caractature on the front page. Polically I think we need more diametrically opposed members in parlament, like the greens, not because they will ever form a government, but because they would draw out complex debate on topics like disability, environment, housing. Even a couple of right wing crazies are good to say stupid shit and have it shot down. We need to continually have conversations about what we want Australia to become.
2. Seeing all these posts about LNP this and LNP that… it’s pretty entertainment but this one about trump and LNP being “extremely aligned” is probably the best one yet.
3. LNP and Trump aligned is the most wild and out of touch political take no matter who you vote.
4. Some in the LNP maybe, but not the whole lot. This is the party of Menzies, after all. The culture warriors, yes? The old schools liberals and conservatives? No.
5. I think you need to get out of this echo chamber and be open to taking on an alternative view. The democrats in the US are more right wing than LNP on most policies, their whole spectrum is different to ours. LNP got voted in for reasons that nobody in this subreddit seems to be able to comprehend because their heads are way too far stuffed up their asses.
6. I haven’t personally seen the media push LNP over Labor. If anything, the ABC and SBS are far more generous to Labor.
7. >simple minds are attracted to conservative ideologies because they are basic and appeal to primal emotions. Progressive and "socialist" policies take a greater than common ignorance undertanding of problems I think this is a gross simplification. Just looking at, for example, housing - the policies presented by the progressive side are absurdly simplistic. The Greens want a rent cap. Introducing a market distortion is in no way a feasible solution. Labor is just finding ways to let people borrow more, again a terribly simplistic solution. Both are bickering over things like negative gearing, which is really just tinkering at the edges. The issue is very obviously a lack of new construction, which could be encouraged via reducing red tape and regulatory burden (usually local council fees, zoning laws & NIMBY issues). The only people I've seen recommending useful reform here are industry groups. I'll give you that on some topics - e.g. crime - the progressive argument appears to rely more on understanding and research, but there's still a significant emotional element there too in the compassion and empathy for offenders. Most beliefs are rooted in based emotions; that's an artifact of being an unreliable chemical driven organism.
8. Lawl, this is how lots of Labor voters think though. (Source: I work with 30 something year old Labor voters and everything OP said is exactly what they say too) Also, they genuinely believe everyone is controlled by Sky News, then will link your articles from left-wing websites/news sources as "sources" of truth. And you gotta go bruuuuuuhhhh to them...
9. I keep seeing LNP voters claiming this without providing any reasoning behind why. From my perspective, I don’t understand the reasoning. I’m more than open to take on an alternative view that makes sense, but what are we supposed to be comprehending here?
10. I don’t think greens write policies to be enacted. They write policies to be a counterpoint. The goal is the happy medium. I’m talking about public health issues like drug reform; treating it as a health problem vs the war on drugs, locking up kids vs providing free lunches to get them in school. Anyway that’s what the research said in the US from my memory, you could probably Google scholar it for a deeper understanding.
11. I find the whole, “your source of truth is rubbish but my source of truth is nothing but facts” to be so dumb.
12. And that's where the argument goes cold, ask for proof as to why the LNP are a better and more sound choice and most of the responses boil down to "wake up sheeple!"
13. CFMEU owns the labor party, literally owns it. Nothing gets built without their say so. They walk into ministerial offices uninvited like it’s their own. Construction costs because of their new EBAs are 30% above inflation and the lower productivity means everything takes longer to build. What do you think happens to a state when we cant afford basic infrastructure? Why do you think houses cost so much to build now and are built so poorly? Our taxes go towards government projects which are deliberately sabotaged by workers so they can get overtime without repercussions.
14. That’s it mate, I grew up around staunch LNP voters and have many people in my life that still are. Their leaning to defensiveness and overly emotional thinking initially led me to do some research for myself. I haven’t yet met an LNP voter that can get further than purely emotional and defensive thinking to explain why they even stand behind the policies of their favoured political leaning. Not even trying to start this bloke up, I am just genuinely wanting to understand why they believe their choice will benefit us beyond just “You can’t comprehend”.
15. LNP isn't going to crush CFMEU LOL. Too much of regional Queensland is unionised for them to consider that.
16. The answer for the older folks is that Menzies was revolutionary for Australia. He created basically all the universities into the behemoths they are today, he dedicated 20-30% of the Federal budget to building housing and brought down the cost of healthcare. He brought home ownership from 47% to 70% by the end of his 23 year reign which has remained stable. The labour party itself was infiltrated by communists which caused it to bleed support (The Katters left the labour party in the 1950s at this time, relevant since they were previously Labor ministers). The liberals also led the way in bringing women into Australian politics, unofficially ended the white Australia policy in 1958 and extended the right for aboriginal voting in 1962. Then when Whitlam finally won, the global oil crisis happened and they had 13.5% inflation. It's pretty much where liberals are better economic managers ended up coming from. I'm not an LNP voter myself but back in those days, they were one of the most left wing parties compared to Europe and America which a lot of older Australians owe everything to.
17. I encourage you to move to Alice Springs. It’s quite vibrant and they need the help.
18. It’s hysterical. I’m sure you were also warned as I was that if the LNP won then QLD would be a real life the Handmaids Tail before daybreak on Sunday and it isn’t so I think you will be fine.
19. If you move to Vic, and LNP gets elected at the next election, what then? Settle down.
20. You’re an idiot if you move because your side doesn’t win. They’ve governed in Queensland for most of the past 35 years. Give it a rest.
21. Wouldn’t that be a bit dramatic? I voted ALP so disappointed but it was closer than expected. Overall life will go on the same as usual, I wont agree with all the governments decisions but that’s how democracy works. They don’t have a huge overwhelming majority to do what they please so that’s a positive. In the plus side - I hated the qsac plan so hoping for a new Gabba stadium rebuild being announced.
22. Well don’t just threaten us, go and help our housing supply situation.
23. No... I'm going to say and vote at the next election. Unless you're a vulnerable part of the population, stay and vote next time.
24. No. Stay and hold him to his word. Crisafulli has said he will: - keep 50c fares - not change mining royalties this term - not change abortion laws - increase the number of teachers, health workers and police Don’t forget this. We need the good people to stay.
25. Calm down. It will be a one term government especially with Miles leading the opposition.
26. Yeah I have thought about it. I definitely wanna see how much they burn in the first year though so I'll hang around for the chaos
27. Trans person here (they/them please), I'm gonna be booking it interstate to where my extended family is when I can afford to do so. Currently I do use hrt but that's under risk currently given the leaked emails about LNP targeting trans healthcare. I don't just take hrt for transition reasons but also because it ironically is a good/safe treatment for a medical issue I have. For my own safety and health I'm gonna have to leave my life behind.
28. The traditional argument was to move to NZ but National is in charge there…
29. Surely you're joking. I'd usually be pretty sure this would be a joke, but it's this sub, so I have to check just in case. If not, then this is a staggeringly dumb take. I'm sure you'll be back whenever the state you move to votes in someone you don't like.
30. After weeks of Labor trolls and shills dominating the discourse here, I think it's fair the LNP side gets a chance. They are favoured by the majority of real life Queenslanders, after all.
31. So the LNP wins, and LNP voters' greatest reward for the outcome is... going around insulting Labor voters. Really shows why you're in it.
32. Perhaps. Reddits left leaning ways are a good antidote to the conservative media. Just go read the papers (any of them), Sky news or watch abc news presenters pretend not to be small c conservatives. I think alot of left of centre people chill on Reddit because the media is a cesspool
33. If the Labor chuckle fucks can't take it back then maybe they shouldn't have been laying it on so thick for the last 3 weeks Besides, if all non-labor voters are seen as evil or ignorant by those stooges anyway, I may as well lean into it for a while until they decide to stop whining about losing.
34. ABC are certainly left leaning. Watching their coverage last night, it was pretty funny how their hopes got up then crashed. Note: Im not a voter here, if I was, I dont actually know who Id vote for.
35. That's a very mature outlook Liberal voters whine about losing too lol
36. It's left compared to the mainstream press. But that doesn't mean it's left wing.
37. It's the internet, there are no mature people, or girls, and if there are girls, they are FBI agents. I just hope those Labor folk crying on here, and apparently also in real life, make use of the Medicare covered mental health care plans available from their GP. It's not normal at all to catastrophise in this way.
38. It’s certainly pro Labor. And a damn sight more pro Green than pro LNP. I mean they aren’t advocating for communism but it’s without a doubt left of centre.
39. I mean it's not the end of the world, I just think the gloating posts are childish and classless. But I agree the people threatening to move states are mostly hysterical.
40. I know you don't like this answer. But you are being taught by the conservative media to think the ABC is left wing.
41. Honest talk. If they would say "yeah, we fucked up, we're obviously out of touch and we need to do better" I would be *significantly* more gracious, or mature, in my comments today. Unfortunately, there are seemingly unending posts of "omg qld so dumb, omg rednecks, omg hicks, omg south luff at us hnnng" that it I find it an *immense* challenge to not inject even *more* vitriol into my comments. I've stated elsewhere that I was under the mistaken impression that the posts over the past few weeks were performative rhetoric, political advertising essentially, however it's become evident that these are actual people who have somehow deluded themselves into thinking they hold mainstream opinions, *and it's everyone else who is wrong*. These people actually do seem to be having a mental health breakdown, and they do need to seek help. But this is the internet, and they have a choice whether to be here or not. If they wish to remain here and double down on attacking the integrity and intelligence of the majority of the state population, they should be prepared to be insulted and belittled in turn.
42. I’ve only just come over from NZ. I can’t vote here. It’s so blatantly obvious 9/7 etc is right wing and ABC is left wing. And remember, NZ overall is a fair bit more left wing than Aus is overall as a nation. It’s not the answer you were expecting, but it’s the view of someone who hasn’t grown up and with pre-determined ideologies of the country and state of the media here as a whole.
43. “NZ overall is a fair bit more left wing than Aus” It kinda depends on the issue. The labour market in NZ is a right wing paradise and the pay is terrible compared to Australia. Pretty significant difference to Queensland on a left/right issue that affects literally everyone in a monumental way
44. I think we will just have to agree to dis agree. But I just will say one more thing anyway. The conservative media openly advocates for reactionary positions. The ABC doesn't do the same. They are not a mirror of each other.
45. Again, this is just the view of someone bi-partisan, with no pre-determined view.
46. No, David was asked many times about a conscience vote and never gave us a straight answer and simple yes or no. Or at least not that I know of
47. I've got more issues with him than just abortion laws, and the late addition of that nonsense into the campaign certainly didn't change my mind about anything.
48. As long as they don’t put it to a conscience vote. Regardless - scare tactic or not - it was calling out the risk this could happen. I work in projects and this is a common practice - call out risk, mitigate and it may or may not happen - always worth calling it out.
49. no. i understand where you’re coming from, but i do think it’s slightly disingenuous. i think it’s more complex than whether the law changes or not. the fact that it’s even a *remote* possibility scraps the idea that it’s a ‘scare campaign’ to me. from my understanding, the katter party candidates who spoke on recriminalising abortion, and the lnp candidates who spoke about being anti-choice in the wake of it, are going to hold their seats. and that is, quite frankly, *scary.* it’s not a scare campaign to openly acknowledge and repeat the dangers of electing anti-choice reps, even if crisafulli doesn’t want to overturn the laws as state leader. and i want to make it clear, the katter parties proposal didn’t shift my voting preferences. i’m in rural, southern qld where they weren’t vying for votes. i’m also in a lnp stronghold where my 1st and 2nd preferences are set to garner about 7% and 4% respectively. my ballot did, however, include the anti-choice ‘family first’ party, who enjoyed a lovely 6th place on my ballot, just as they did last election. [edit; for spelling.]
50. No. If you read the KAP proposal and then understand that LNP are required to conscience vote on major issues, then this wasn't a scare campaign. The person misleading people was Crisafulli by not being truthful.
51. It's not just abortion laws, it's also cutting the mining royalties and "slashing" public jobs. Plenty of people seemed to have voted Labor because they are 100% convinced those things are going to happen. It was perfectly fine to vote that way because The LNP reallyyyy struggled to define their position on those topics towards the end of the campaign. However if they don't happen a lot of people who consider themselves politically savvy are going to have to admit they were at the very least misinformed.
52. Katter has committed to putting forward a bill to repeal the abortion laws in Parliament. Crisafulli hasn't ruled out the LNP having a conscience vote on the matter, and has stacked the LNP with pro-life MPs. Until he rules out conscience vote, it's not a scare campaign. There's a very real possibility that enough LNP members will vote with Katter on his bill.
53. >If the laws don't change, will you acknowledge that Labor misled you? I don't think it's as simple as that. The question is fundamentally flawed. KAP wants to enact changes to abortion laws. It's also pretty clear that several LNP candidates would support those changes. It's disingenuous to call it a' scare campaign' when there is real, factual substance to the discussion. Moreover, I think it was pretty clear from the massive push-back from the voting public that such changes would be met with significant resistance. The LNP won't be about proposing any further changes lightly, knowing what a storm it created the first time.
54. It wasn't Labor that misled, it was the KAP and the LNP. KAP for saying early on in the campaign that they would introduce a Private Member's Bill to repeal the *Termination of Pregnancy Act 2018*, and the LNP for never answering the question about whether they would allow a conscience vote or not. Labor simply said that if the KAP introduced the bill, and the LNP had the numbers and allowed a conscience vote, that abortion would again be criminalised in Queensland. This is still true.
55. If the laws don’t change, then I’ll be relieved. However this wasn’t a case of being mislead by the media. This was a case of people asking the leader of a political party to rule something out and people hearing his answer, or lack of answer to that. If he had come out and said that he guarantees that no changes will occur to abortion laws right from the start this would be a non issue. If you walked past a guy in the street with a knife … a youth let’s say … and you asked them if they were planning to stab you with that knife and they responded that “all of my friends know what my plan is, and that isn’t currently my plan”, you might be rightly concerned with how they chose to answer the question. Please just tell me straight up that you’re not going to stab me.
56. Nope. It was a legitimate concern based off of facts. Why do you care?
57. Dude, the LNP were elected because of their 'youth crime' scare campaign. The entire state's been taken in, and you're obsessing over this? This is how campaigns are run. It's stupid, but that's how it is.
58. The irony of LNP accusing Labor of running a scare campaign when 95% of LNP messenging has been on scare tactics around Youth Crime amazes me. Side point, his own LNP MPs saying we can't tell you what we'll do on abortion until we are voted in kind of warrants a campaign on this, would be dropping the ball if they didn't jump on that.
59. It was a great campaign message and on this issue and many others they are now backed into a corner, Crisafulli is straight out of Newmans cabinet the clear message is they want two terms so they are now stuck between want they want to do and how to stay in power, ie do nothing much/change nothing much for 4 years. So think of it this way they have almost guaranteed abortion rights will remain so that’s a great outcome. Steven will make a great opposition leader if he stays and hopefully he cracks that 110kg bench soon
60. Even if the laws don’t change. If legislation changes are brought to parliament and a conscience vote is allowed it will be damaging to women.
61. Probably not, I wasn't taken in by a "scare campaign". My concerns were entirely because the LNP refused to concretely answer if a conscience vote would be allowed in the event a bill is brought before parliament. I imagine for most people it was the simple knowledge that: A) KAP would introduce a bill if LNP win majority. B) the vast majority of the LNP oppose abortion. C) they refused to concretely answer if a conscience vote would be allowed or not. With those in mind, there is a very clear and believable sequence of events that would likely lead to abortion laws being wound back. Changing the laws may not be part of the party's plan but it doesn't need to be for it to be a genuine threat. It's not a scare campaign if there is a genuine threat of it happening. Whether it actually happens or not is, of course, yet to be seen but it is a genuine and real possibility. Besides, most of the LNP's platform around the country is just scare campaign nonsense. If they're going to sling mud every election they should expect some mud to be thrown back at them.
