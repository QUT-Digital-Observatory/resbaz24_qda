Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. If they’re doing it anyway then why does it need to be legislated? What’s the motive for the people bringing this to the table?
2. Because a) abortions are carried out before the age of viability, so no birth before 22 weeks will survive b) if there is an abortion after this stage it would be an induction of a baby that has a condition that is not compatible with life anyway. These babies often are born breathing, legislating a doctor to provide ‘lifesaving care’ is removing time parents might have had with their dying child to implement care that is traumatic and unnecessary. C) do people really think viable babies are being born and a doctor just watches them gasp for air when they could help, and just choose not to? And D) ‘failed abortion’ Is a thing that happens so rarely it’s not even worth discussing. It’s a fantasy. Nobody in favour of this bill has offered any statistics or data to support their position.
3. This type of legislation is an anti-abortion bill that grossly misrepresents later abortions. It’s a copy of activism/legislation from a US group called Live Action and in Australia it’s championed almost exclusively by people who oppose all abortion - Joanna Howe, Australian Christian Lobby, Right to Life Australia, Cherish Life QLD. The vast majority of medical groups don’t support this bill or the federal one that had a senate hearing last year. This article explains why it’s very problematic: https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/aug/28/australian-conservatives-claim-babies-are-sometimes-born-alive-after-an-abortion-whats-the-truth
4. That information is incorrect. Any baby born alive legally has to be cared for as a person with full rights. However if the abortion is done because the fetus is not viable, and it is born alive, best care may be to simply keep it comfortable while it dies.
5. it is a direct copy of an american bill and you’d have to be a fucking idiot to believe it. a if there is a baby alive outside of its mother that is just a fucking human that is required to be provided care like any other. that doesn’t happen because people aren’t just having abortions for fun with viable third trimester pregnancies, but even if it did it is clearly covered by the law. >seeks to legislate care for infants who survive abortion procedures. Under current Queensland law, there’s no obligation for healthcare practitioners to provide life-sustaining care to such babies if they are deemed unwanted. like how fuckin stupid are you? there’s no obligation? yeah there is. the same one that applies to all humans. >This legislative gap has led to cases where babies born alive after failed abortions were reportedly left without medical intervention. yeah you’re smoking some good shit now >Katter’s bill would mandate that any baby born alive, regardless of the circumstances, receives medical treatment comparable to any other newborn. which literally is already law.
6. Someone gets an abortion, but the baby is breathing when it comes out of its mother. Currently, that baby is left to die. This law doesn't want that. I would want a personal discussion with someone who would walk away from that living baby.
7. They have a majority of just one... It doesnt take much panic in an LNP member with a tiny margin to crack and cross the floor...
8. Given they repeatedly said they wouldn't do it, it seems like they have a reverse mandate. "We said we wouldn't do it, we won, hence the people don't want us to do it".
9. Well yeah, under crapitalism all working class freedom is under constant threat of removal. If that's what you mean.
10. My guess is that Labor’s reddit misinformation team got paid until the end of the month.
11. Sure if you want to take it to the nth degree I suppose if it was a possibility we should also pre-emptively protest to stop that. Let's see what the LNP do, the new coal mines won't mine themselves.
12. > Oh, don’t forget to march against taking the vote off women Yeah if David Crisafulli had voted against an act codifying the right of women to vote in the past few years, I think that would definitely be fair enough.
13. No but until the immediate threat of criminalisation of abortion has passed by (i.e. this first couple of months especially) we need to raise our voice to remind the government that we won’t accept any changes. Then if they go to criminalise it (or restrict access) THEN we disrupt. The point of disruptions and strikes is that it hurts the politicians most. Voters are pissed off, cbd economy slows temporarily, it costs the state. And so it should if it means we can protect a woman’s healthcare and rights.
14. Exactly. "plans change" "Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth" Etc.. take your pick. Call me wild but I don't trust politicians.
15. Given we know how they voted in 2018, We can be sure that if the bill is tabled abortions will become illegal. [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/17/queensland-parliament-votes-to-legalise-abortion) You can't trust the LNP in any capacity on what they say but people eat it up constantly.
16. The LNP can stop the bill being tabled. As the party in power, they control Parliament and can make it difficult for Katter to even get a vote started on the bill. Other ways are to vote to send it to a committee for discussion, to report back to Parliament in 3 years time.
17. Wrong. They explicitly ruled it out, after the scare campaign had gained momentum. You just weren't paying attention, obviously. https://youtu.be/sP2b1tB4-5U?si=d0AAgRcyO-28K0Hk 0:37 is the timestamp, if you're lazy.
18. Choosing the lesser of two evils is still choosing evil. Your “tactical” voting is actually the least tactical way to vote possible. If everyone who does what you do stopped then the votes would stop flowing to liberal or labour. Vote for third parties instead of the major. Every. Single. Time. Nothing will change with your “tactical” voting because the minor parties will never win enough votes to gain independence from the major parties. If we start regularly voting for minor parties they’ll go “hey, we have an even playing field against these major parties” and the votes will stop flowing to the major parties. On top of that by voting minor first a lot of members of the major party will leave and join minor parties they better align with.
19. Still better than voting for the two major parties. Notice how I also said vote for the greens? They’re complete opposite ends of the spectrum. Idgaf who you choose as long as it’s not ALP or LNP. Maybe try using your fucking brain instead of slapping the keyboard like a monkey
20. Ahh yes. I’m the stupid one for saying that we need change. Get a fucking brain bozo. You’re unironically a bootlicking sheep. All you do is vote based off emotional connection to a party. They are OBJECTIVELY both fucking horrible parties. Idk how all you are so stupid you don’t realise it but ffs no wonder this country is becoming a shit hole
21. I was only sticking to bottled water and soft drinks, but thanks for the idea.
22. What the fuck is wrong with you? You've been given all the relevant info from healthcare professionals. But you refuse to read it or accept that your first impression was vastly incorrect. You must be the most intelligent cunt in the country in your mind. Fucking embarrassing ego on display by you people!
23. Not as different as you’re claiming. We have actual Trumpists in this country. Seriously, I’ve unfriended many on Facebook because the delusion is that real. Sky News is on free to air in regional Australia for a reason. The LNP has been down this road before. They stick a Liberal figurehead at the front of a Nationals ship. For decades LGBT people were told “you can have civil unions, just don’t call it marriage”, so we did that, and then in the very first week of Campbell Newman’s government they said “nah, it’s too much like marriage, so we’re going to change them to ‘registered relationships’ and you can’t have a ceremony and it’s not recognised anywhere else.” The first fucking week as if it was the most important issue they had. So yeah, call me fucking jaded at these lying religious cunts. But you’ll be right, your bank balance will continue to go up because that’s all that matters.
24. Righto. But if it doesn't you have to eat the whole fence. No sauce or salt. Just sit and chomp.
25. They have absolutely not been making our quality of living better over the last 10 years. Maybe in Brisbane but out in the rest of the state is is objectively worsening. Also nice strawman dumbass. When did I blame them for supply shortages, national interest rates and climate problems? Fucking hell you people are dumb. Rural Queensland is collapsing and Labour have done NOTHING about it for DECADES and those are facts. Do you know who decides the next state government? It’s not the goldcoast and Brisbane. It’s the rest of Queensland. So yes. Labour IS to blame for neglecting rural Queensland. Labour have done such a fucking horrible job that they got themselves kicked out after despite being in power for 90% of the last 35 years. If they had ACTUALLY done well they would have been talking about how great their track record is instead of just pointing and saying LNP is worse. If labour had ACTUALLY been doing a good job they would have been voted back in. Labour came THIRD. More people voted for the greens than for labour. If that isn’t proof enough that people have no faith in labour anymore you’re just fucking stupid.
26. interesting how if you look up reasons for abortions what your saying is actually part of the minority of reasons why people abort.
27. its interesting how i said nothing about that but your pushing that idea as if its the main reason people abort their child, when statistically its not. I am in agreement that you should abort if the child hasnt formed properly/rape/life of the mother. Im not in agreement that if you want careless sex then maybe you will have consequences. Its never been an easier time to avoid pregnancies, so do that avoid being pregnant dont just kill the thing you have created because you dont want responsibilities
28. yeah they had so many choices they could have made before the point of needing an abortion.
29. They are stating that they believe abortion should not be allowed to be another form of birth control and should not be acceptable in instances where a child is conceived because two consenting adults wanted to have fun. Don't shoot the messenger. I didn't get it at first until I remembered my euphemisms
30. Ahhh, so we should all relax and assume that the Christian Nationalists won't do what they believe their God wants them to do. I am not relaxed.
31. I mean tbf he’s said a lot of things and then backtracked. It’s not like he doesn’t have a track record of this.
32. What he's said is it isn't in his "plan". I haven't heard him rule out a conscience vote on KAP's proposed bill, which they have promised to introduce.
33. Oh thank fuck, the politician said so, it must be true.
34. he already went back on his word that he was going to quit over youth crime numbers
35. 1.I don't know if you know this, but politicians don't always stick to their promises. 2. You need to read up on history and the power of protests.
36. Yeah Its unlikely he won't change given how they have voted in the past, if the KAP put up the privates member bill we know it will pass as planned afterall they voted against it in 2018 apart from 3 LNP politicians who had the common sense to vote against the party. [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/17/queensland-parliament-votes-to-legalise-abortion) Just Delusional that people actually trust this fella in any capacity or in general the LNP after they are known to lie and take back there word constantly.
37. he said HE had no plans to change it. When Katter introduces his bill, he will not direct his party to vote against it. which is effectively given it a pass.
38. Comment respectfully. Continued harassment may result in you being banned.
39. Yep, father of two, if my wife or daughter ever needed access to healthcare and was denied by the Government for "reasons", I'd go postal.
40. zealot implies they are acting on what their faith teaches. Christianity contains nothing against the termination of a fetus. The religion has been co-opted to serve the wants of the wealthy few many times in history and still is today
41. I mean... Changing abortion rights is a big deal. It's a very justified reason to be angry and passionate. Thing is it's still very up in the air what will happen, which obviously means fear and uncertainty. It's understandable, people like having rights.
42. Fear of losing bodily autonomy isn't quite as simple as brushing it off and moving on.
43. This is the first time I’ve seen that both options have such radically different outcomes. Labour has provided a lot of real improvements for the life of everyday Queenslanders. Whereas it sounds like the only thing LNP has committed to it locking up children, firing doctors/teachers, allowing property developers to donate money (bribe) the government and give more money to mining companies. Now they’re probably going to ban abortion…
44. we are not. however there are a few topics where people get very invested and heated. Abortion access is one of them. it took a HELL of a long time for abortion to be decriminalized and for access to become available. going back to the dark ages is not acceptable.
45. It’s insane. I’ve been in Aus 2 years now… and it’s literally part of people’s personality it seems. Not something I thought would happen moving here. It’s America Lite.
46. People have too much access to social media , half of them think the next prime minister is Trump or Harris. It’s people trying to use merrica style politics in Australia.
47. Yeah us trueblue aussies don't give a fuck about politics 😎😎😎
48. If it was going to be illegal I’m sure you’d somehow need to prove you’ve been raped … And what’s the other % of abortions. Medical conditions?
49. Sorry mate I’ve got an antivax mother and I know for a fact they didn’t force anyone to do anything that they didn’t begrudgingly consent to. But keep playing victim I’m sure one of these times it will work on someone.
50. Yes thank you. Let me kill my unwanted babies in peace :)
51. Very entitled to think that a strangers medical choice is your business
52. All but 3 voted against decriminalising abortion last time, so I wouldn't be too confident about that. As for the rest of your comment, okay I guess?
53. You’re right they won’t be random babies because abortion is still legal and they will be able to access health care to terminate unwanted pregnancies
54. Do you really want me to quote all the times in history a politician said they won't do something, then proceed to do it? As for the protest time , it's 6pm ? Most of the traffic should've left by then
55. Frankly the only way it WON'T happen is if enough people make noise about it and let them know it is unacceptable. 90% of them including Crisafulli prefer abortion being illegal. If they thought they could sneak it through without anyone noticing they absolutely would.
56. These people have no idea about the laws or what actually happened in 2018. I knew of women who easily got multiple abortions even in the 80s and 90s no questions asked by the doctor, they just did it.
57. When they decide to back track. What's more important than defending women's rights to body autonomy on a Friday night?
58. Another friend had to terminate after non-survivable defects were detected on a 24 week ultrasound.
59. You won't see me at the protests because I don't believe that LNP will care about any protests against violating bodily autonomy. If you convince me that they somehow will, I'll go For context, I voted for Labor thIs time
60. Not a Christian bludski you just worry about making sure your steam deck works little fella
61. Yeah, and yet MAGA might be applied here despite this not being America
62. It shows the politicians the temperature of an issue in the public. Australians in general do not like to protest. If enough people are motivated to protest about an issue then it usually flows back to being a lot that people care about that issue but couldn't get to a protest for one reason or another. If no one is protesting then it shows it's not an important issue, in their eyes. It's like the tip of an iceberg. Campbell Newman's Titanic MASSIVE majority was sunk by a relatively small iceberg (Public Service cuts), this issue impacts 50% of the population, which is a much bigger iceberg.
63. There are medical conditions that have nothing to do with pregnancy or babies in general. Medical conditions for women who are NOT pregnant that they use the same procedure as an abortion for. This is what I am talking about. You ban one procedure, and that has ripple effects. For those of us who need a procedure like this because we are ill, are bleeding heavily for 6 months, in agony, have a condition that needs treatment etc and this procedure helps us - it’s amazing. It’s a medically necessary procedure. It has nothing to do with abortion or pregnancy. It helps combat an illness to do with uterine issues. However if you ban it for one thing, it cannot be used for ANYTHING. You are taking away the rights to anything to do with this type of treatment. Again - I’m not talking pregnancy here. I’m talking medical conditions that use the same procedure. If abortion is banned so are access to help women with these issues and there are many of us with them. Would you like your healthcare taken away?
64. When will men take responsibility? It takes two to tango so what are YOU doing? What are men doing to prevent unwanted pregnancy. Answer the question. I don’t have an issue with abortion, I don’t have to do anything about it because I love abortion. I’m glad it exists. If I could have a job doing abortions every hour of the day I would gladly do it for minimum wage, hell, I’d do it for free on the weekends! It’s YOU who has an issue with it, so what are YOU doing to prevent unwanted pregnancies, other than being in celibate? I teach public health and sexual safety courses pretty often, actually. Whole fucking reason I’m in public health. So, again, you have such a problem, what are you doing to tackle the main cause of abortion?
65. If it takes two to tango, and you want to take away women's autonomy and choice as to when they have children - It's only reasonable we take away men's autonomy and make each man get a vasectomy until he is married and has permission from his wife to reverse and attempt to have children.
66. No I’ve got plenty to hand out to you weird religious folk who care too much about unborn children
67. Nice try. Of course I do. I am a woman who has had to fight for months for QPS to 'believe' me. I know better than most exactly how this numbskull idea would go, ya wanker.
68. He can still put forth a bill, you don't need a majority for that. Then the LNP could in theory vote any way they like on it, and we know what way 90% of them like.
69. Because they arnt doing it, you see the “medical experts” are telling porky pies
70. They listen to Trump and his moronic rantings about abortion up to the ninth month and after birth. They're as stupid as he is.
71. >\>legally the present Guideline provides for the care of a baby born following a termination procedure, it does not contain, nor is it necessarily informed by, the force of law. the Guideline is merely that. Indeed, the disclaimer on the inside cover of the document states that the Guideline is “provided for information purposes only.” the present Guideline with respect to babies born alive came into effect in October 2023. Prior to that date, the clinical guidelines, with respect to any babies born with signs of life, recommended “not \[to\] provide lifesustaining treatment (e.g. gastric tubes, IV lines, oxygen therapy).” The amendment brings the Queensland law into line with South Australia and New South Wales.12 The Termination of Pregnancy (Live Births) Amendment Bill 2024 removes any doubt that a baby alive as a result of a termination of pregnancy procedure has the same right as any baby born in normal circumstances. This reflects the importance of equal treatment for all babies born in Queensland.
72. Late term abortions are almost always performed on wanted babies with catastrophic medical conditions that are incompatible with life. Babies who are born without kidneys, or with no brain - who can never live. This bill would mean that instead of being able to pass in their parents arms, will now spend their last/only moments of life having their ribcage broken by CPR, poked with needles, and given invasive and painful last resort care. And for what?
73. They have a majority of 1, with 10 seats still not called. It's entirely possible they end up with a majority of 6.
74. Except the LNP has an extensive history of blatantly ignoring public opinion to appease factional heavy weights. And the desire with the LNP to criminalize abortion again is overwhelming.
75. They didn’t say they wouldn’t do it, they said “it’s not their plan”. They specifically refused to answer this directly knowing full well that someone like Katter would introduce a bill for a conscience vote. LNP did this last time with civil unions. They said they weren’t going to touch civil unions but they did so in the very first week of Campbell Newman’s government.
76. There you go then. What's everybody worried about? They surely wouldn't go back on their word. After all, it's a 'Fresh Start' for them (according to the billboards) All I meant was that they're probably not going to give too many shits about public outcries. They never have before.
77. That's one of the most ironic comments I've ever seen, and that's saying a lot considering this is Reddit.
78. 'It can't be a part of the plan if we don't have a plan.'
79. Abortion hasn’t been illegal in QLD for decades. Even the link you posted explains the decriminalisation was regarding extremely old legislation. I easily got an abortion in Brisbane in 2011 & my aunty had a 3rd trimester abortion in the 90’s for health reasons. It’s really frustrating that people keep failing to demonstrate basic comprehension of what that decriminalisation vote was actually about. If Katter did introduce a bill to repeal that legislation it really wouldn’t do much in terms of access.
80. Thanks for sharing that. Good to see he says it directly in this instance. But I’ve heard so many LNP MPs use the very specific “it’s not in our plan” language and I know a number of very anti abortion people just got voted in. So I’m not sure I believe him. And we know how he’s voted in the past on this issue.
81. Yeah cause politicians always tell the truth and are the most honest bunch there is /s 🙄
82. The LNP are very good at explicitly going back on their word, though.
83. I can't believe you're being downvoted for providing evidence of the truth. I'd like to know why the mods aren't doing anything this fear mongering.
84. You said to vote for Pauline. That’s all I need to know about your thought process on politics in Australia.
85. What's wrong with them is they're allowed to vote. THAT'S what happened on Saturday. Qlders have short memories, short attention spans and shorter brains. And I know, I live there.
86. Hahaha nah the cunt is simply pro-life and just not very smart about how he presents it
87. The first time I saw a Dodge Ram with a giant Trump sticker on the back window in my suburb was almost as surreal as it was horrifying.
88. I didn’t know that, and shame on them. Doesn’t change the fact that the KAP are eyeing a rollback of abortion rights, the LNP are wittering on about it “not being their plan”, and too many people are content to dismiss the entire thing with “it’s not going to happen.”
89. Vasectomies are reversible. So, I spose we could make a law that men are responsible, control your bodies instead.
90. Not all LNP MPs are devout Christians who believe abortion is an affront to God. But they are all politicians. And shrewd politicians read the room. They are aware that this isn't the 1950s anymore. Katter can bring in a conscience vote, but it would fail when it came to the crunch I agree people have to be proactive on getting a point across that the majority of Queenslanders won't stand for abortion bans. My original comment simply stated that, looking rationally and logically, at the political environment and history, LNP MPs would be incredibly stupid to make such a gamble and risk another decade in the wilderness.
