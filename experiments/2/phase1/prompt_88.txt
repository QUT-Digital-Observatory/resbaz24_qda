Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. There's a lot more evil at play than some people using drugs recreationally. I wonder if you have the same stance on alchohol? Anyone who thinks pill testing is bad is just as bad as the person selling the dodgy drugs. You can't tell people what they can and can't put in their bodies so if they are going to do it anyway we may aswell make it a safe as we can for them. What's evil is a regressive government.
2. Yep, white collar crime gets less attention. It yields a higher level of return as well.
3. Just like sending kids to boot camp who haven‚Äôt committed any crimes yet!
4. They're not law abiding citizens, though, are they? By pure definition someone buying and using illicit drugs IS a criminal.
5. They are super nationalist...and the rural area is huge. Worries me that so many racists/bigots/conservatives are out there. He was the favourite until the abortion law repeal came into it....and then women (and men) said , "Hey , this sounds Trumpie conservative...." Labor and Myles have done absolutely nothing wrong but the hard rights (along with Channel 9/Sky/7) have convinced them the State is falling in. It's doing nothing of the sort but there are so many numbskulls who don't actually look at stats, it's not funny. Fkn religion is involved. I'm bang smack in the middle of Dutton territory...and the thought pattern is all about 'environmental energy sources' are going to kill us all. The wind turbines are going to jump off their pylons and take us all out. I kid you not.
6. If they didn't prioritise their fantasies above reality they couldn't be LNP.
7. Tbf the evidence based policy to end drug use is literally mass murder or incarceration. The Phillipines is one of the few countries I am aware of that made a significant dent in drug use. The issue is that to do so is a horrific series of policies.
8. And remember when sweet old Jen had to teach Scumfuck that r*pe was actually kind of a bad thing actually? üôÑ
9. I‚Äôm not no scomo fan, but how is him funding that a bad thing ?
10. Whilst no plans are out now I would definitely bet money on a private prison contractor miraculously "popping up" as soon as they bring child youth crime laws into parliament
11. Hmmm, I usually refer to us as the Texas of Australia, Hanson, Katter, Voldemort and Palmer bunch, so much bigotry, racism, sexism and homophobia... its insane!
12. I think this is an unfair comparison. We just had almost 10 years of a progressive Labor government, with the at risk policies broadly supported by Queenslanders. Hugely important moments in the union and progressive movement have took place in Queensland, especially central and far north. We've also got one of those most concentrated media industries in the country. We are constantly bombarded with propaganda by the LNP and their media mates, funded by developers. That's gonna have an impact on the average person with low media literacy. The other states (looking at NSW and VIC) like to shit on Qld all the time, but we're not the cunts who voted ol Gladys Bin Chicken, are we? We're not perfect, but we're not as bad as people make us out to be
13. Oh, I don't know though. I'd love to see a future PM (or even the current one) say, "We're going to build a huuuuge bridge from Tasmania to New Zealand, and back here! I am sooooo ripped off my tits right now!" :)
14. Yeah he was a ‚Äúrising star‚Äù in Newman‚Äôs cabinet, local government minister I think
15. Which costs more money than state run prisons, so the question stands
16. Which is fucking bananas, because you leave the public service, become a consulant, and charge twice what you were getting beforehand. How is this economically rational?
17. The only reason the LNP has a chance is because of the media. The media is owned by a few billionaire families who have untreated clinical greediness, who want more money which they don't need and which will make no material difference to them, in a world with starving people, and who own the media to propagandize and sane wash for their political stooges. The media invented the whole fantasy of crime being out of control in Queensland while it's at record lows. They can create any reality they want to get Labor out and the LNP in.
18. It's actually simpler than that. People don't have the understanding that there is a different way than punishment. They see themselves struggling because they can't hit their kids anymore as way of punishment and look back at the old days thinking a good thrashing solved everything. So it's simply eye for an eye punishment. People are too burnt out with financial stress to change their minds and actually think and learn about harm minimising. They just think that locking up kids solves everything.
19. They can be... No limit on social media just candidates. I haven't seen anything good so far, like purely on merits it's amateurish at best.
20. Oh, fuck off with your pearl clutching. This article is about pill testing at an event where teenagers are celebrating their freedom. There will be drug use there whatever you say or threaten them with, the only difference is the amount of dead kids at the other end. Wake up to yourself.
21. Just the desert vista Armageddon style smouldering fields of sulphurous wasteland as outlined on the book they follow but haven‚Äôt read called the Bible. Just so they can experience the pure joy they will expect us to all exist in once their policies of ‚Äúmore for me and less for you now I got mine‚Äù are put into effect the day after the election when all of chrisisfullofshit‚Äôs true to self beliefs will suddenly come flashing back to him in his moment of clarity where he remembers being totally against freedom of choice, anti-abortion and redevelops his sick fetish of seeing poor people suffer even more so any poorer LNP cultists at least have a strata of people below them he can point to as the reason behind all the ills and problems with the lives of his followers.
22. Oh you‚Äôre right sorry, I misread that line üòì I just remembered them mentioned around the Payroll Tax being labelled a Patients Tax
23. My former father in law is a practicing doctor and a right privileged racist cunt who believes the Navy should sink migrant boats and only migrated to Australia because, 'South Africa went to shit for whites,' after Apartheid ended. He got his training as a doctor whilst serving in the South African military during the Border War. Being a doctor doesn't preclude you from being a cunt.
24. In my opinion, and clearly reasonable minds may differ on these things: - some of Labor‚Äôs Covid border policies were too extreme (I‚Äôm not an anti vaxxer of Covid denialist in any way btw) - I object to cheap political stunts like 50c public transport fares. - I consider the tens of millions of dollars being spent on the ‚Äòtruth telling commission‚Äô whose outcomes are entirely predetermined and which you and I could write today, to be a monumental waste of time and money. The fact Labor will ultimately try and use that to push through a treaty is even more objectionable to me.
25. No, evidence shows that a "tough on drugs" approach does work. The issue is that to truly be tough on drugs is horrific and shouldn't be done. Queensland is not tough on drugs. They are useful in reducing death from drugs. But again, that risk is part of the negative consequences and by removing that, there is nothing that stops people from taking drugs. If there is little legal ramifications AND you can guarantee the safety of the drugs then there is little discouraging people from taking drugs. Drug addicts can get help. You don't get imprisoned for walking into a rehab centre. A real issue is that Queensland is soft on drugs. Did you know that being addicted to drugs actually mitigates the amount of time you can expect to spend in prison for an offence? A domestic violence perpetrator that was on drugs and is addicted can expect the Court to look at a more lenient approach. Even better if they do a single 6 hour rehab course in prison. There is also a significant issue of the difference between whether it is a criminal and health issue. It is health professionals that support pill testing, it is not the Courts or legal professions.
26. Sniffing one line of Ketamine is just the same as injecting Fentanyl in your eye, don‚Äôt you know that?
27. They‚Äôre too stupid to understand that it‚Äôs in their best interest to fund drug testing as it costs significantly less of their tax dollars.
28. That same outcome could be achieved if they weren't doing drugs at all though lol
29. I've never used illicit drugs in my life, champ, and I can still see it's a fucking brain-dead idea. What's your excuse?
30. You think young people taking a couple of caps at the occasional music festival are ‚Äújunkies‚Äù? Bizarre.
31. There are two issues here. 1. Charging someone for carrying a minuscule amount does more damage than good. It could have been a one off and the amount is hardly anything to create a serious issue. As soon as you charge them, you create a criminal record. This can lead to issues such as getting a job, obtaining rentals, documents etc etc. Rather than prevent drug use, you encourage black market drug use. If you are on a strict one and out, you might be less inclined to seek help if you need it, or engage in preventative drug action. 2. Removing pill testing creates high likelihood of potential OD's and improper drug use. If you get given something under the guise of it not being harmful, take it, and it is in fact harmful, too late. If you get it tested and it's proven to be harmful, you've saved yourself. Without that outlet, the pressure stakes are higher than if you were to go, "I'll take it from you, get it tested and if it's dangerous, it'll get taken away and I won't get charged".
32. Actually, I agree with pill testing and medical intervention rather than locking them up, I was sarcastically projecting the LNP policy on youth crime and drug use. FYI, I have postgraduate qualifications and have never used the recreational drugs you mention. Alcohol, a different story *
33. You absolutely can tell people what they can and can't put in their bodies; you legislate such things and enforce it with appropriate punishment. The problem nowadays is this ideology of 'do what thou wilt' and believing people should be free to do anything they like without any regard to the wider community, combined with no consequences for those who choose to do the wrong thing.
34. Hey!!! He is just a young man that made bad decisions and we should NOT talk about it or judge him and his father based on those actions. Have some respect. Also fuck you, you dirty druggie, even if you just have a joint on you. Poor people aren‚Äôt allowed to do drugs
35. Jail. Let's call it what it is mate cmon... Boot camp makes it seem tame and they are justified in what they are doing...
36. Mate you ever cross during a yellow light??? ....Guess that means you aren't a law abiding citizen either yah filthy animal
37. So you've never jaywalked before? Because if you have, and I'd be willing to bet the farm you have, then you're not a law abiding citizen, are you? By pure definition someone jaywalking IS a criminal. See how silly that sounds? The law isn't black and white and there are very good reasons for that.
38. And who defined that as a crime? Maybe not Crisafulli himself, but it was some paternal 'tough on crime' shit-head like him.
39. Nitpicking grammar is classism, and we're in an informal setting here. This ain't no letter to the king*. *n fuk him 2 neway.
40. Spot on m8 Unfortunately to use simplicity ( there are exceptions as cities like Townsville being an ALP strongholds and the Gold Coast being pro LNP ) we‚Äôve always had a huge divide between Brisbane and the rest of the state. Basically all the old school conservative type Libs got the arse when the coalition split under Petersen. There don‚Äôt seem to be guys like Terry White in the modern LNP. The religious nuts and National Party crooks took it over.
41. Since when is ending drug *use* the goal? In Australia, ~2000 deaths annually can be attributed to the use and misuse of every illegal and prescription drug combined. Alcohol causes three times that, and we celebrate it as an essential part of our culture. No-one is trying to end drug use. If the goal was to reduce drug deaths, drug-related harm, and the economic impacts of drug abuse, then there is a wealth of evidence that could inform policy - none of which Crisafulli and his pre-enlightenment bretheren are remotely interested in, because actually helping people is never the goal with these cunts.
42. He justified it because Jen had it. Not because it affects 1 in 9 women. Because it affected 1 of 1 women he was married to.
43. The contractor who happens to be good mates with a minister in the govt?
44. Given we literally have a Texas here in Queensland, pretty accurate. Don't forget that One Nation literally tried to secure an illegal under the table political donation from the American NRA a few years back, only to realised they'd been stitched up by a sting from Al Jazeera who wanted to prove how cooked they're prepared to go.
45. Given our great reptile population, maybe a combination of both is in order. Australian Florexas? Texida?
46. Sounds like something Hawke would say after a few too many schooners.
47. A rising star that funneled $320k from the government during the Newman era.
48. They will build it for them then sell them for pennies on the dollars, it makes no freaking sense but it‚Äôs what will happen.
49. This is where Federal Labor needs to step in. We should of had that royal commission into the Murdoch media monopoly but alas they lost their gumption after Shorten's loss.
50. >which will make no material difference to them Hey, how dare you! They'll be able to get more respect from other millionaires, and that's what really matters. Fuck everyone else, let's make Australians pollies rich again!
51. Exactly. Not sure how much more illegal we can make illegal things though at the moment. Outside of public executions, we are at peak punishment. (Most of the conservatives will stupidly support this; right up until it impacts them or a lived one, then suddenly their black and white view of the world develops many shades of grey). People need to understand we need to live with all of these people eventually, so investing in rehabilitation, not just bigger and stronger jails is what‚Äôs needed.
52. Yep. Because I voted for Labor last election. What a mistake that was.
53. All good!! I also found it quite hard to read because of my eye twitching
54. Yeah, and if your grandma had wheels, she'd be a bicycle. Let's deal with reality, not fantasy. Psychoactive drugs have been used for thousands of years and will continue to be used for thousands more. No amount of 'just say no' has ever achieved anything. Pretending it does only leads to more sons, daughters, parents and friends dying.
55. Any drug policy works in the daydream version of Qld where nobody does drugs. In the real world though we‚Äôve tried those policies and failed miserably.
56. Sorry the sarcasm didn't come across - agreed. (Though with the caveat that medical intervention is only needed when drug use is *in fact* a health issue - e.g. addiction, and that the vast majority of drug use is not a health issue but instead a personal recreational choice). Ofc, just because someone with higher educational attainment is *more* likely to have done recreational drugs, doesn't mean everyone with a postgrad will have done so. It's just the statistical outlay, and one that anti-drug campaigners often overlook or are unaware of. (further caveat - not suggesting that someone's worth is tied to their educational attainment, but I just like this stat because it subjugates the anti-brigade's view that drug users are unemployed criminal junkies, when the overall truth is the literal opposite)!
57. Id like you to shove your head up ass in that case. So why are they still allowing people to smoke when it's such a burden on the health system? why are we allowing people to drink alchohol when alcoholics are a danger to themselves and society? People are going to take what they want to take because believe it or not most people don't care what the government says you should and shouldn't do. If people want to take drugs why can't they have access to tests that can confirm purity and impurities To help them make wiser decisions. You can literally save lives with pill testing.
58. I follow your logic but for clarification, traffic infringements aren‚Äôt crimes. Some actions are crimes though. Drink/drug driving, reckless driving(including excessive speeding), fleeing, failing to stop and render aid in a crash you‚Äôre involved in(but not minor fender benders, that one is just a fine for failure to exchange details). Oh and driving without a licence or while your licence is suspended/disqualified. Basically, if it‚Äôs a mandatory court appearance, they‚Äôre considered criminal acts and can result in time in custody. If all you receive is a fine with/without demerit points, they‚Äôre not criminal acts. They are just infringements.
59. And if I get caught I accept it and don't ask for orange light runners to be given leniency because I know what I'm doing isn't right or legal
60. I see Conservatism (right round the world) as Organised Crime now. They are all protecting each other right down to their pedo churchies. I'm really hoping Brisbane's sprawl includes more Greens and Labor supporters. I feel it may but the roar from rural is all nationalism and segregation. The roar from Liberals ...is religious ideology not stopping at controlling women's decisions for their own bodies but moving onto everything the bible hates. We can't forget how good ole Aussie Pauline was quite prepared to work with NRA to firstly get voted in and then to chance gun laws. I just had a friend murdered by gun....and these fuckers want everyone to have free access so we can live more like America. It's about the only good thing Howard ever did...and I do give him credit for that. I probably haven't lived in Qld as long as you as I lived offshore...so not sure about the Petersen era.
61. Slavery is perfectly OK to religious conservatives. The bible has guidelines on how to treat slaves properly.
62. The Gillard government tried media reforms along these lines. Shouted down by all the media ganging up to get rid of any whiff of media regulations. Unfortunately only gives the media ammo on an easy "they're restricting free press" rhetoric.
63. Do U actually believe a 15 year old should get labelled as a criminal if they have a couple pills on them at a festival? Like genuinely?
64. Have you actually looked at countries with progressive drug policies? What do you make of the data?
65. You know a bit about suckin' on boots like a cock, aye champ?
66. There isn't a dirty boot for miles in any direction around you, is there?
67. This dude would own slaves today and see no issue whatsoever with it if it was legal
68. He didn't give a shit until it affected a person he considered "his".
69. He's supposed to represent the people, and look outside his own family, and his own existence for what the **country** needs. If Jen made him realise, then that means he's never thought about the thousands of Australians and community organisations that have already told him what needs to be done. He didn't do it for Australia. He did it because Jen said he should.
70. Him funding it is not the bad thing, the reason he did it is bad. Theyre just a bunch of selfish fuckwits that only think about their own lives, so he had no interest in funding it until his life was affected by it.
71. He only gave a fuck about something when it began to affect him. He shouldn't need Jen to give him a basic sense of human empathy.
72. Absolutely. If they can kill, traumatise or permanently impair a person why should they be exempt from the consequences of their crimes? Their ages make it no less traumatic for their victims and families. 15 is old enough to know right from wrong.
73. We should really give Jen more credit than she got. I wonder how many other times she managed to get his head out his arse that we don't know about.
74. Bro he‚Äôs asking you about a teenager taking some MDMA, do you have any idea what taking these drugs actually does to you? Of course not, you‚Äôre talking like a fool. It doesn‚Äôt instantly turn you into a murderous psycho jfc
75. But like they are taking it for themselves. A personal amount. They aren't spiking people or selling it in masses. The only damage they will do is potentially to themselves, just like if they had one too many drinks and have to get their stomach pumped. Their ages make it so they are more impressionable and want to break the rules.
76. Said the quiet part out loud there champ, nobody respects racists
77. Which race did I discriminate against? Just to be clear, I mean.
78. To be clear I don't engage with bad faith racists
79. The harsh reality is the outsourcing to consultants you‚Äôve seen grow and grow as a trend for the last 20 years is a function of low white collar public servant salaries. The general public has this view that the lanyard class doesn‚Äôt really do anything and they twiddle their thumbs pretending to work while getting 100K What people want to ignore is that this is actually far too low. 120k is around the cap you can feasibly get to in most jobs unless you want to start taking on serious management jobs. And there‚Äôs no bonus.Do you know what private sector consultants get paid? It‚Äôs more than that, and the ceiling is infinite, and there‚Äôs bonuses. A lot of skill leaves the public service once they hit the AO7, AO8 mark because the progression crawls to a halt and there‚Äôs nothing more you can do. You simply must leave and go private sector to consult back to government at a wild cost to the agency - but hey, it‚Äôs not public servant salaries and it‚Äôs not new FTEs so who cares what we pay. People who talk about capacity building or weening off consultants want to pretend like there‚Äôs a free lunch where they can just ask nicely and the public sector gets more skilled and they can cut consultant use but without massively increasing public sector wage .
80. Out sourcing consultancy has become an addictive and costly habit of all state and federal departments.
81. It's not 100% a skill issue it's also a structural one. Cannot eliminate entirely but absolutely can cut it significantly... The LNP spent a lot on consultants last time they were in from memory so saying they will cut sounds like big talk.
82. So the LNP are planning on cutting consultancy costs "to reduce the growing reliance on costly consultancy reports", but then they're spending $50m on consultants themselves to figure out the best way to solve the youth crime epidemic that they fabricated.
83. The only consultations LNP need come from Jabba The Rinehart
84. My observation in the sector is that LNP *LOVES* consultants. Like REALLY REALLY REALLY loves them. They also created many of the consultants when they sacked thousands of public servants. Worth looking around how many big consulting firms donate or are members of LNP. Major. Would we rather cost effective and well trained staff who are held accountable, or very expensive consultants doing the same jobs? Can‚Äôt wait for LNP to start letting go of their consult mates. LOL.
85. chainsaw consultancy bill.. would make one hell of a mess
86. First the lnp will hire consultants to design the new agency. Then they'll contact people to work in the agency to get the "right skills". I don't think it's a bad idea, but it will take a long time to establish and lnp will still need to rely on consultancies in their first term, no matter what the costings say

89. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that sophisticated. Just a little echo chamber.
