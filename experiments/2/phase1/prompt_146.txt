Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Thank you honey. I am in DV hell with my two beautiful babies. I am as privileged as they come. I’m white, post grad educated, smart as hell, well paid, skilled, charismatic. And yeah, it doesn’t matter. I have been beaten down and crushed by a system set up so that abusers prosper and women only get pity, and they should consider themselves lucky to get that. Every aspect of my life has been affected. I have lost family that I thought I could count on because they sided with my abuser. I have NO family in Queensland. I am alone, I am broke, and in debt. I don’t act like a victim because I don’t feel like one. I am a survivor. I am fighting. I don’t fit a comfortable narrative for the powers to be to gallop in and rescue the fawning damsel. Fuck that shit. I’m not helpless, I’m strong. I want a system that serves the people it should be afraid of. When I was at uni I was part of the socialist alternative, drifted away as I got older. Baby I have been re-radicalized and I am going to put the boot on some skulls (metaphorically). I am divine. I am the revolution. And you should see what my kids can do too.
2. I live in one of the more conservative voting areas of Qld but vote left. I want to know how can I find out when protests on this are occurring. In the 90s, at uni, I used to protest often but it is very hard to find details about such occurrences these days. I’m sorry for this woman. I’ll try to fix things where I can.
3. Can we not start prioritising women's healthcare before we concern ourselves on backwards views? When I took BC (for a long time of my post-puberty life) I was riddled with many MANY side effects. The ones that caused the LEAST (not none) were never under PBS. Being a uni student and paying $90 for a script meant I ate a lot of weetbix and noodles, and only weetbix if there was milk that my housemates would share. I didn't drink or party or smoke, I wasn't wasting money elsewhere. I caught the bus to uni and my rent was $170 a week. I was just broke, like students can be, and to tolerate my health issues, I put a large part of my measley money into birth control. Let's get free preventative options going before we start restricting the post-care options. More children are going to be born into toxic, unprepared, and horrible circumstances. That's the reality. We live in a pretty good country compared to the rest of the world. Our homelessness isn't bad when compared to others, our healthcare isn't bad when compared to others. Yes, there's room for improvement, but.. jeez this is just all fucking backwards. Punishing the woman isn't going to be "fine" for everyone else, the children and society as a whole are going to feel the effects of these unwanted pregnancies in more than just the domestic circles that these heinous people are thinking.
4. I had to terminate this year to get out of a DV situation and fell pregnant due to reproductive abuse. It horrifies me to think of how my life would be right now if I didn’t have that option. If kids keep being born into and exposed to DV, the cycle only continues and dominoes. More kids in the system, traumatised children, more youth crime, more DV.
5. I'm so thankful that I lived in Brisbane in the early 2000's & had access to a safe place for my termination. Even then, I had to deal with protesters outside.
6. This is so upsetting. How can we have become this way as a country? Hate this America Lite we are becoming.
7. What changes are QLD LNP proposing? All I read is: “Now, if you’re asking me about, would I ever support recriminalising it, the answer is absolutely no … “Do you believe in a woman’s right to choose, yes or no?” he asked. “It probably won’t work for his TikTok, but yes,” Crisafulli responded. “There will be no changes to abortion laws if government changes in Queensland,” Crisafulli responded.
8. Under LNP “plan” she will have the baby, then not afford to feed it in school. The child will struggle due to the myriad of forced socioeconomic circumstances and then develop mental health disorders and developmental disorders but there will be a bed waiting for them in a private youth detention centre.
9. Needless to say that had the women gone through with the pregnancy and kept the child that would simply be another hook that he has in her for the rest of her life. This especially being the case with tracing family connections by DNA - it’s only a matter of time before he pops into their life again. Adoption no longer affords any sort of anonymity, escape, or the ability to put people permanently behind you.
10. From what I have read on this subreddit so far today, general Queenslander views on this are “well that doesn’t affect me so I don’t care”.
11. Agreed, 100%. I almost cried when I saw the news this morning.
12. I just started studying nursing last month. I am strongly reconsidering entering healthcare with LNP in power for the next 4 years
13. I don’t believe they will make any changes to abortion legislation. If I am wrong then holy fuck but I don’t think I am.
14. My god the LNP arent going after abortion rights. It was labor propaganda and fearmongering. Turn on some critical thought already
15. We’re called Queensland because Floribamaxas is too hard for the people that make it that way to spell
16. It's stories like that are why healthcare decisions should be between a person and their chosen health professionals. I don't need to know, don't want to know, and see no reason for me to know why someone has to make the healthcare choices they have to make. I also see no reason for them to be the business of a politician, a judge, cop, a lawyer. None of those are healthcare professionals. If my daughter came to me and said ' Dad, I'm pregnant, what should I do' asked me for my advice, wanted my help, trusted to seek me out, the first thing I'm going to say is 'whatever you do, whatever happens, I will always love you'. Or if she chose to never tell me it would make no difference. Because it's her choice if she wants to involve me, wants my opinions, my ideas, about anything. That's what should be the rights of any person, to decide who is involved in their health decision making. Not some old farts in robes, some happy clappers, or some old dried up crones screeching about their gods.
17. Did you listen to his speech? He emphatically said it would not change. He said we are not America and do not pander to extremists. I don’t know what else he can say. And for those who actually read more than political slogans from either party the most contentious issue is late term abortions which would not apply to this patient. But still not an issue at this stage and if it does become an issue I will be protesting along side you. But please stop with the fear mongering. You are no better than those on the right that do it.
18. Abortion will always be legal in Australia. They would literally have to change how the whole Australian government operates if they were to change it. Its just fear mongering.
19. I'm really sorry we did this. For me, the abortion issue was the single greatest one in this election. I will fight anything the LNP tries to do in the next four years to criminalize or revoke rights and I hope everyone here does the same.
20. Wait unless there is evidence that the LNP are going to re-criminalise before getting worried, or it's all for nothing. It's currently an assumption, and contradictory to what they said they would do. They might break the promise, but they might not.
21. So the way to stop domestic violence is to kill a baby. I don't understand this logic at all. It's the bloke that's need punishing not the unborn.
22. Absolute idiots voted for LNP. I can proudly say I didn't and never will. Their agenda is clear😡
23. At no point was this ever an lnp platform. The amount of you that have been absolutely hoodwinked by labors scare campaign is astonishing.
24. I have never been so confused in my life. I'm seeing this everywhere . Did they change the laws. ??
25. Have you read the Family Act and parental rights? Does it stipulate at what life stage women hand the male them? Have you read the Domestic Violence Act and figured when and what needs to happen for the father to be stripped of said rights? Not saying it’s a bad stitch up but let’s play good society as it stands. Sure Telstra has 1800SAFE to port your mobile number in DV cases but this is 50% x and 50% Y chromosome. No? Appreciate being the oven but appreciate the seed. I guess. Maybe “give dad a go” would love to take bub day dot and let mum continue on her way. Who knows. Weirder things have happened in history. Not sure if DVOs list unborns and if so are they aggrieved or parties to?
26. She can still get a termination. Nothing has changed and nothing is going to change. Calm your farm.
27. The LNP has NO intention of changing Abortion or VAD laws.
28. I can't believe that so many of you were completely suckered by believing the ALP "panic spin" to try to win votes. The LNP has NO intention of changing Abortion or VAD laws. And Katter just said they'd introduce a private member's bill to shit stir cause he was pissed off that LNP wouldn't play ball with preferences. Katter has been reduced to 1 member now anyway. So not a chance hed even consider it 😂 You can all just settle down. Accept that many more Qlders voted for LNP. Like it or not. That's democracy. Stop being silly.
29. Labor ran a great fear campaign about abortion laws. The actually made people genuinely fear this when Crisafulli said nothing of the sort. They also proved people believe anything that is said to them without looking too much into the real story. You can count on this: Australians are generally quite progressive in regards to abortions, we aren't so backward as America on the subject, if they DO change it you can guarantee LNP will be shooting themselves in each limb by doing it and guaranteeing another decade term in the wilderness...
30. The meltdown on here is insane. I’ve got proof that the abortion laws won’t change, can we have proof that they will please?
31. Fuck right off with this political fucking brainwashing guilt tripping bullshit. Because thats alll it is. It shouldnt even be allowed on reddit. You won/lost, who cares, build a bridge, theres more to it than wimply what party is in. small minded idiot politics.
32. The laws aren’t changing, this has been discussed many times. Can you come and post your story again if such a thing ever occurs, thank you.
33. That s a sad story. But is most likely that, just a story. Sorry you lost but now at least the kids who do survive will have a better chance at life. Huzzah the win for sanity.
34. Considering the amount of Victorians that moved to QLD are we surprised LNP got in............
35. Well you’ll be glad to know that absolutely nothing is happening to abortion services so stop the fear mongering BS
36. You must be young if you think abortions were hard to get before 2018 lol
37. What are you on about ? Nothing is changing with the abortion laws, how many times do you have to be told ?
38. It was a very hard pick for me and I don’t think anyone else especially men should be telling a women she cannot have an abortion- It’s not their body. The main reason I chose LNP and I believe more Aussies did too was because of the youth crime crisis. Labour wasn’t doing anything about it, it’s getting out of hand. I genuinely sleep in fear most nights worrying about whether or not my house will get broken into, if my family will get stabbed to death by these teens. A friend very close to mine not too long ago lost their mother to these youths breaking in, and watched their mother get killed infront of them. These youths had committed previous crimes and should have not been allowed out. You know at the age the offenders were the difference between right and wrong, there’s no excuses.
39. I think you are making mountains out of mole hills. The LNP have stated they are not looking to change any abortion law and KAP have stated that the changes they want looking at refers to late term abortion. Nothing has been said about criminalising abortion. This post is just more fear mongering even after the ALP has lost....
40. Oh calm down ffs. Nothing is changing with abortion. I'll be right there with you the second it changes. The war is over soldier, go home.
41. Australians are confusing American politics with Australian politics. No one really cares enough to change abortion laws in Australia but if you keep carry on about and want people to discuss and debate it you’ll end up with less.
42. Probably shouldn’t be providing sensitive information like this online, I’ve seen health care professionals lose their registration for less
43. "Killing your baby won't make you feel any better about your trauma, infact it will make things even worse." -psychologist.
44. I don't understand your point. Abortion is legal in Qld and has been for a long time. LNP clearly said that it's not on the agenda for this government to change those laws. LNP have always been about inclusion and respecting an individual's right to choice (unlike Labor's no jab no work policy) Nothing's changing. 🤷‍♂️
45. No votes even occurred yet, it’s likely the majority of LNP members wouldn’t support a change with the exception of late term non medical abortions. This notion that the election was won on abortion is the exact reason the LNP won the election. Stop the fixation with something that’s not going to happen.
46. QLD, you fucked up. And I've never once voted Labour before this election. My family are historical federal and state LNP voters, but this guy is not the guy.
47. Using a contentious issue like abortion to fear monger vulnerable women into supporting your political opinion is top tier manipulation, and I fear for anyone that comes to you for genuine health assistance. Should be ashamed
48. There's lots of words said in the campaign's how about waiting if anything will really come of it before becoming doomsayers, you might be worrying about nothing in the end
49. We are all fucked, I have come to NZ a few days ago for a holiday. It feels like the Australia I grew up in, every one is free and happy, no over policing, no stupid and harmful local laws and no ciggerets buts everywhere. Fuck Australia.
50. I’d hope you’d be more educated as a healthcare worker. I’ll look any woman in the eye and tell her I voted out the health minister who put Queensland’s healthcare system below every other state in the country, to put in a party that I believe can fix that, and has also said 100+ times on record that there would be no change to any abortion laws in the state.
51. The election result has no jeopardised any of her safety, health nor ability to have children in the future, her choice of the Rusty Coat Hanger has.
52. What are you on about? You are properly cooked. Even if the LNP thought it worthwhile to pursue limiting QLDs (objectively/comparatively extremely liberal) abortion laws, exceptional ‘hard cases’ such as this woman’s circumstances would definitely be excluded/unaffected. Again, all of these ‘hard cases’ comprise no more than ~3% of abortions. There are plenty of ‘hard cases’ for the pro-choice side too btw. What do you say to a woman who desperately wants an abortion ONLY because the fetus is female (sex-selective abortions are very common across the world)? Or what do you say to a woman who desires a late-term (post viability) abortion merely because she was counting on a promotion she didn’t ultimately get? Can you force a surrogate to abort the child she is carrying because she drank alcohol? What about the possibility of artificial wombs? Do you get to kill the unborn even if they aren’t in your womb? Why/why not? and so on…
53. Not sure what the issue is when abortion is still legaL?? it hasnt been decriminialized or made illegal at all, stop making a mountain out of a molehill and politicizng womens issues.
54. Jesus the propaganda will not stop will it, LNP will not be changing abortion laws. Grow up stop being sooks your party lost get over it.
55. I would say that she is welcome to take that child to an orphanage 🤷‍♂️
56. We need a generalised government reform on all aspects of government. I live in the Labor paradise of Melbourne and it's not great here either. Sure we got more access to services for all but we need a lot more services when thier is no opportunity for anyone
57. How about don't be in a abusive relationship. Time people take accountability for there choices.
58. I would gladly. Just because you were in a domestic violence situation is no reason to end a humans life. You must die so I can live is barbaric at best pure evil at worst.
59. Yeah I’ll do that when abortion laws are changed but they haven’t been and likely won’t be
60. Why punish the baby for the father's crimes? Send the father to jail, why murder the baby? There's no justice in that. Killing the baby won't undo her abuse. Two wrongs won't make it right.
61. How does you helping kill her child make her life any better? She's not only a domestic violence victim but now a mother to a dead child
62. Probably the saddest part is so many people voted early/postal voted for LNP, then a lot changed in the last two weeks but LNP already had those votes in the bank.
63. He is staying on and they won’t make a second term. They’ll do enough damage and the muppets that put them in will realise what a stupid decision that was.
64. What worries me is that my husband is a teacher . Campbell Newman sacked so many public servants and closed schools. Who us to say that wont happen again?
65. The party as a whole don't get to leave it alone. Katter will be submitting the member's bill, and then we can only assume there will be a conscience vote because even though he was asked a thousand times Crisafulli would not rule it out. Then it just comes down to individual pollies. Last time the LNP had a chance 90% of them voted against legalisation. I can't imagine too many of them have changed their mind, and their base will be pushing them hard to vote to repeal the legalisation. I hope you are right that not enough of them will, but it is a real concern that enough of them will vote for repeal.
66. I mean, they are running on an almost identical policy platform to newman. So I guess *'hoping'* that they don't fuck it up to bad is a take I guess.
67. I (QLDer born) had a colleague when I lived in Vic for a few years that called QLD the "Texas of Australia". I was offended, but now... I'm disappointed, horrified, and upset. But, he doesn't seem wrong.
68. I'm so dissapointed with my fellow QLDers. I've never needed termination services and hopefully never will. Its so fucking short sighted to not think of all the legitimate medical and emotional reasons that such a women's health service is needed.
69. What do they think of the state that had left government for almost 20 years except on wanker for 30 months.
70. Yeah sorry but it’s true. I was pretty surprised that people were shocked on the outcome.
71. Hey it was only like 47% of us, can't paint us all with that stupid brush.
72. This is such an idiotic cliche. Other than Dutton, we don't mainstream our nutjob pollies which is more than what I can say for ScoMoron & Hockey, both inner city Sydney libs.
73. Generally people who have told me not to worry, aren’t women or havent been pregnant yet. I would most likely die if I got pregnant and gave birth again. I’m scared.
74. I am the same. They keep saying to not worry, they’re not going to touch the laws, so I try to believe in them. And if they do touch the laws, I’ll be marching.
75. He will absolutely keep his word.....his word was that they had no plans to repeal the legalisation of abortion. What he didn't promise after being asked 50 times was to not allow a conscience vote if Katter brings it up. Which tells me that is exactly what they will do. Then you will have an LNP majority made up of politicians who 90% of them voted against legalisation just a few years ago having a conscience vote on abortion. There is no way to guarantee that it won't be repealed, and Crisafulli could not promise that it wouldn't.
76. Okay baddie 💅🏻. But seriously, go you mumma! This is so beautiful to read!
77. You don’t sound that smart to be honest, sounds like you played yourself and got backed into the corner. Lmao. Response to commenter: What do you want me to say, someone was bragging about how intelligent and amazing they are after explaining how it sounds like they made every possible wrong decision they could and have had life hand there ass to them. Dunning Kruger in motion.
78. As a male nurse who has cared for women post termination and has comforted many women after miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies and all around shit situations I would never want myself or my (future, hopefully) partner to be in; I will happily join you guys on the street. I've never been to a political protest but I will happily join you guys because I care deeply about women's health. To see somebody die from something entirely preventable would crush me.
79. I am old enough to remember marching for women's rights in the 70s and 80s and this morning the idea that I would be doing it again to protect a new generation was the first thing I thought of when I looked at the news.
80. Following ChildrenbyChoice on social media would be a good starting point for keeping track of protests/politics etc. Reproductive Rights QLD became active during the election but seems SEQ based and I think is linked to unions rather than grassroots activists
81. I am a “left” voter in Katter’s seat, and was gutted to see the news early this morning. I am early 30s and have never written a letter to political leaders but that was my first thought after “ah, FUCK”: “I need to pay attention and start writing letters.”
82. If in brissie, 1st November King George Square 6pm. As said elsewhere, Children By Choice is a good starting point. Also the student unions and the greens.
83. Then the kids born from all of this will usually end up criminals and feed directly into the narrative the LNP want
84. >If kids keep being born into and exposed to DV, the cycle only continues and dominoes. So sad and so true
85. Going to 100% increase crime if/when they make it illegal
86. Exactly you could still access abortion before it was ‘legal’. The same clinics today were operating fine and no one was persecuted. I cannot believe the amount of people losing their minds over something that is a non issue. They have said a million times absolutely nothing is changing.
87. They're not directly. Katters party is proposing it [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-10/qld-abortion-analysis-kap-election-debate/104450992] and last time the laws changed only 3 LNP members crossed the floor to vote FOR decriminalisation. So many people are concerned that KAP will put a bill in "quick as you like" to quote Robbie Katter, and a majority LNP conscience will vote it across the line and wham, bam, fuck off Ma'am, it's illegal again. When it was decriminalised the LNP members that voted for decriminalisation were going against their party platform. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-17/abortion-legal-in-queensland-after-historic-vote/10382538
88. My housemate and I did cry. I've had a hysterectomy, and I still cried for the women this will affect. I will be marching when the protests start. So will she.
89. I am an experienced nurse working in public. I am extremely nervous. Won’t hesitate to pack up my kids and GTFO if we need to.
90. > I don’t know what else he can say. "If a bill is brought to parliament to re-criminalise abortion, we will not have a conscience vote, we will have a party vote against." That's it, that's all anyone wanted him to say for weeks now, and he still couldn't.
