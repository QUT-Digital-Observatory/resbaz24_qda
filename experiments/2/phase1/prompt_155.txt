Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Yep, it's an absolute slap in the face to throw out a decent government running a great economy, let's not forget tool subsidies for people doing apprenticeships, making mining companies pay more all because dickheads did what they were told to do by their sky television controllers. Dumb fucks with short memories. Based on this result a government doesn't need to run a good economy doesn't need to address homelessness and poverty doesn't need to reform things that need reforming doesn't need do any of the things that the fucking media criticise the government of the day for supposedly not doing. All a government needs to do to get elected now is talk enough shit and spam the airwaves with a plethora of worthless one dollar slogans. Oh yeah and accuse the incumbent of being communists or something to that effect.
2. They’re not lying about anything. It’s changing the gender on their forms not the sex. If anything keeping it incorrect would be heaps dishonest. But I guess you can go on living in terror if you want?
3. I hope youre enjoying the first day of the tyrannical overlords in power. 🤣
4. and not once did i suggest that one family owning the majority of the media was not a problem. simply Murdoch is not the reason the labor losing. hell being in NSW I heard more positivity about Miles then the liberal candidate. Hell the whole abortion thing should have been a good nail in their coffin, but people voted change. Something that happens literally all the time, consistently, over and over. Its easier to be the person spruiking that you will fix the woes of the state then the incumbent trying to say give me more time to fix it
5. What a pointless thing to say. Like yeah obviously? But government policy is also a huge factor. You have no real argument do you?
6. lol you’re so patronizing. You have no understanding of the nuances of statistical analysis, have taken first year stats correlation doesn’t equal causation, are probably a young labor stooge who has no working class background. I’ll tell you what neoliberalism means; it means the erosion of working people’s wealth which is then consolidated into the wealthy. Which has occurred at a rapid pace under federal and state labor and liberals. Labor puts band aids on it like all liberals but it does not address the root cause; the inherently exploitative nature of capitalism. Labor is turning away from unions, turning away from its working class base and being punished for it. Patronizing them, calling them stupid, gaslighting them. Examine your own parties failures.
7. my argument post 2020 was, the total Covid expenditure would have gold plated all our infrastructure needs. Instead we have post world war 2 infrastructure expected to support mass immigration. Wait for a drought to affect the east coast.
8. Jeeze, sound like a pleasant guy... I'm glad any party someone full of hate like you would lose an election, sees like a good thing.... but yes, cope harder
9. You clearly don't know what it means if you want the government to be in control of petrol mate.
10. Things like investment and removing red tape around additive manufacturing. Investing in things like tafe and taking more active steps to create more blue collar jobs, not just bloating government departments. Properly subsisiding childcare. Maybe actually taking a cut from the ore we mine. Since its unlikely that mass immegration will ever not be a thing significant investment in infastructure, cross river rail is great but we need so much more than that.
11. I don’t live in qld mate so I didn’t vote for anyone , I don’t care who people vote for as everyone has their reasons and democracy works via majority. You think you are above the majority of Queenslanders simply because they voted differently to you . You and that attitude are the reason people vote against your side , sanctimonious arrogant assholes galore 🥳🥳🥳
12. Yep - the Health Department is desperate but it’s all good we have trains and lots of them
13. You seem to be conflating some things. Public sector doctors wages have nothing to do with Medicare. They are state funded. Medicare is federal and unrelated to this election. What is your source for stating that public sector doctor's wages are the lowest on record? I sincerely doubt this is correct. Medicare rebates for GP's in the private sector however, are yet to catch up after the lengthy rebate freeze that occurred under a Liberal government.
14. I never said it was free. Pretty rich of you to call someone a dimwit while you spout false information. On that note though ambulance is definitely not a fee for service in the way that it is in most other states (except for Tassie). It is the same as the other emergency services in QLD, there is a levy to cover costs to keep the state safe. As it should be.
15. Why are you getting so upset? I’m aware there would’ve been voters who are exceptions like yourself presumably. But I am being factual. The policies passed, the politicians voted in & inheriting the most and leaving the least is all factual.
16. I agreed. I actually think it's the low social economic suburbs that vote lnp.
17. No I wouldn’t of. In fact if as a country we decided Gen Z (my Gen) and Gen Alpha are going to have to sacrifice for nothing for the greater good then I’d be onboard. Not everyone is as selfish as your generation champ Your argument is so dumb it hurts to read. Hey chief, you realise the silent and greatest generations had less people and more resources than boomers and didn’t have a higher standard of living? 😂😂 It’s got everything to do with policy and nothing to do with population or resources we are so resource rich it’s insane. Norway have $10Trillion in the bank just because their mining policies for one example
18. Lets be real it doesn't. $50 every 6 months is $1.90 a week. If your family was struggling with that you'd be in a food and or housing program already. Please stop glazing the minuscule changes made by a government looking to be re-elected.
19. Are we seriously arguing that 20% of rego was the best the could have done for cost of living? Because if so then all governments are cooked.
20. There are no longer any private (adult) prisons in QLD. The two that were private was Arthur Gorrie (GEO) and Gatton (Serco). All since 2020 (by memory) are now public owned including the new Lockyer Valley one.
21. You lost me at 'Guardian'. Would've almost been tempted to have a look until that.
22. much easier to learn when your stomach isn't grumbling and empty.
23. Yep. And there should be capacity for horribly violent crimes. But also isn’t the focus on rehabilitation? If 15 years isn’t enough to rehabilitate a teenager then wasn’t is? How does 25 years change things for that family. How does 35. What would be the ideal outcome for you? Capital punishment for them instead of jail time? Acknowledge that issue then work to prevent the next generations of potential problems.
24. IIRC the best deterrent, according to studies, is the likelihood of being caught and punished
25. I’ll defer to this study from UNSW from a quick google. But I’ve read similar studies over the years. So yes I don’t think it’s a deterrent. https://www.unsw.edu.au/newsroom/news/2020/07/do-harsher-punishments-deter-crime#:~:text=The%20myth%20of%20deterrence&text=“The%20severity%20of%20punishment%2C%20known,is%20the%20likelihood%20of%20apprehension.
26. Jail time is not an effective deterrent for serious crimes, no. The vast majority of such crimes are committed in the moment. Very few are premeditated, and even then, are done under the assumption that they won't be caught. If you look at places with capital punishment, like the US, you will quickly see that that harsh punishments in general are ineffective. Since the prison system has no real ability to rehabilitate, and in fact severely limits your ability to reintergrate into society and your job prospects, contact with it increases the likelihood you'll reoffend. You treat the material conditions leading to crime in the first place. You can lose a hand for theft in Saudi Arabia, but hungry people still steal bread.
27. I work in the youth detention centre. Detention is not a deterrent. I see the same kids come in over and over and over again. We are also not allowed to offer programs (rehabilitative opportunities) to youth who are not sentenced. Out of the 160 kids in the centre at the moment, only FIVE ARE SENTENCED. The rest are being held on remand.
28. Ah yeah sorry. It’s the only part of the policy they actually care about to speak of. And it’s at the top of all their list. And they dedicate stories to just talking about tougher crime. Also, most of the points you raised from their policy aren’t social infrastructure commitments to prevent. They are post crime intervention. Get off this bullshit about single word semantics to argue against. They made sure it was clear tough on crime is the only thing they care about.
29. I’m 45 and I was called a boomer 5 years ago by some kid that looked about 12.
30. Oh dude for sure. Leave those paint chips off from the hailstorms. Keeps the rent down too
31. The figures reveal a reduction in the rate of youth offences of 6.7%. In addition, the total number of unique youth offenders has reduced by 2% since last financial year and by 18% since 2012/13. The rate of unique youth offenders has reduced by 4% since last financial year and by a staggering 32% since 2012/13 [Latest Crime Statistics from Queensland Police Service](https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/100936)
32. Why would anyone do that? Why would I want to make myself worse off for the benefit of people I don't care for? That doesn't make any sense.
33. Sadly, they own the vast majority of the local papers and have forever. While this doesn't matter now with younger generations, it's preconditioned into older people (50+) that they're the best source of news *"Because they're "local". They have journalists in every town because they own all the newspapers everywhere, so they get the information direct from the people".* Of course, that hasn't really been true in the last 25 years since highspeed internet became a thing, but that is how Murdoch captured their brains. Obviously they were never a good news source, but that was how they'd explain it.
34. People don't want to think for themselves, it's too hard. They want someone else to tell them what to think so they can get back to their insignificant lives.
35. Have you evan read the proposed changes KAP want? I'll give you a hint, its not for the recriminalisation of abortion, it's a couple of very minor changes around the edges which amounts to the following: - Abortions after 22 weeks are no longer permitted for social reasons. That simply means you need to decide before the baby is viable that your not ready to be a mother. - Doctors who conscientiously object won't be forced to refer you to a doctor who doesn't object. You'd still be free to find another doctor on your own. Even before 2018, when abortion was technically illegal, we still had 14000 abortions every year, and many of these resulted in prosecutions? Recriminalisation of abortion would have no impact, so why would they bother doing it.
36. Absolutely. They’d get the law changed for a couple of years, get smashed in the next election, lose all possibility of winning again for the next 30 years, and then the law would be changed back again. It wouldn’t be worth it.
37. My apologies there was no comment above except deleted. I have edited my comment and just provided facts without commentary
38. *labor, They’ve lost touch have they? Through wage increases, tax cuts and lowering youth crime to name a few
39. Do you expect any less from that poster? Look at their replies in here. Completely clueless.
40. We're in mountains of debt, chiefly because of our response to Covid. We're at $135 billion while NSW sits at $95 billion in the red. Various programs have been wound back or cancelled. Our healthcare system is held together with thoughts and prayers, with [hiring freezes](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-06-27/victoria-hospitals-hiring-freeze-budget-cuts-staffing-health/104028710) in place for critical frontline staff. Everyone I know in the public sector finds their department shrinking. And while there's no shortage of oxygen thieves in government, I can assure you there's a good amount of people doing important work who are having to look to other states for work. Our ambulance system is [stuffed.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-09/ambulance-ramping-leaves-victorians-without-paramedics/104289358) We're at risk of [having our credit rating downgraded](https://smallcaps.com.au/victoria-looming-credit-crisis-debt-downgrade-infrastructure/) (we already have the lowest rating of any state). A significant amount of our revenue is from [fining each other.](https://www.theage.com.au/politics/victoria/victoria-is-the-fines-capital-expected-to-rake-in-almost-1b-this-financial-year-20240317-p5fcz6.html) Which we do at twice the rate of the Queensland (the next most heavily-fined). To hold Victoria up as a paragon of good governance or anything remotely aspirational is not wise at this point in time. Sure, we're fantastically progressive and have done very well in many areas, I'd temper your enthusiasm about how things are going down here.
41. Are t they in a colossal amount of debt and adding to it every month with no end in sight?
42. The principality of sealand springs to mind, just don’t do a Norfolk Island and demand Australia nor Queensland provide social assistance such as universal healthcare.
43. The evidence is that when children remain in the environment that the majority are living in, is that they will never stop the rinse and repeat cycle of crime. Education is available to 99% of kids but the parents don’t take them. The parents don’t cook for them, they do not have a safety net in their family home. Increase social and psychological help and they won’t attend the appointments, Increase home visits and mandatory removals will increase. I know the revolving door, all the good work done at detention centres is lost when they return home. It is time to get tough, more removals need to happen when there is no improvement with repeat offenders.
44. Did you read the actual policy on this matter or you just running with the slogan? Have a read of it, you might learn that it isn't about locking up 10 year olds.
45. thats horrible for her to go through, but m not going to pretend a subjective experience is an important objective representation of reality.
46. I can do that too. My kids will never have a home because idiots keep voting for LNP to ramp up property prices. Everyone has a sob story.
47. So your solution to this horrible event is to put the kids into jail so they can be abused and fall further into delinquency and then return in 10 years as adult criminals? Are you some kind of moron?
48. Crime has been on a steady decline since 2008. People commit crimes in regional areas simply because it's easier to get away with. It's inexcusable, but it is not a new thing.
49. If you went to uni, you'll know anecdotal evidence barely qualifies as evidence at all.
50. Crime as a whole has gone down, I haven’t cherry-picked offenses. Even if an increase in unreported crime were the case, how are unreported crimes the governments fault? Better yet, how do you know there's an increase in crime if it's largely unreported? But yes, I get slapped with the overused "Dunning-Kruger" label. People like you learn a new term from a podcast or something so you can polish your superiority complex.
51. Reality is that most lnp talking points are manufactured by media
52. The experts with decades of proven experience working in those fields, vs "Down Under Patriot Bro 4 Lyfe" on your Social Media feed telling it "like it is" based off "research". I got a question. I'll design and build you an aircraft. From scratch. I know what I'm doing as "I've done my research" watching "Lefties are Betas" dude on my Insta feed. Then I'll get Airbus to do the same. Now I'll ask you to hop on board. With all your loved ones. Which plane will you choose? Which plane has the best chance of... Performing like a plane? The "Sovereign Citizen-300” or the Airbus?
53. I mean take a look around to be honest. Half of the comments on here are acting like we’ve just put Nazis in power. This is democracy, the majority have spoken. You can be upset your party didn’t win that’s fine but you’ve just called the majority of Queenslanders a “waste of space” because they didn’t vote for the party you did. Frankly get over it or pack your car up and fuck off.
54. This is not correct. Your birth certificate has your biological sex recorded - not a "gender" - the laws deliberately conflate and confused gender with sex. It allows a male to record "female" on his birth certificate and be treated as such. I'm not living in terror. Women are.
55. It's not pointless. We do not live in a black and white world. Crime has been decreasing since 2008, the whole discussion is moot. We have a criminal code, law enforcement, and courts. Due process still exists, and each case is unique. You can't throw the book at every single defendant because of something called precedent. Meaning they have to base their punishment on someone elses sentence for the same crime in similar circumstances. Labor intended on tackling the root cause, not override due process with authoritarian-like punishment. Throwing a kid in prison for 10 years will not solve the issue. It will just create more problematic and institutionalized adults. Therefore, there will be more generational crime.
56. Covid spending was for dealing with an emergency and our current financial woes are the recovery process of that expenditure. To spend that on infrastructure continuously would put us in permanent state of financial crisis. And it would have to be a continuous spend because infrastructure needs maintenance and rebuilding. It isn't a one time spend. The maintenance costs of the road to Burketown would keep us broke. It would be like buying a good quality car and never servicing it.
57. An authoritarian one party state characterized by dictatorial control. A state owned petrol station has nothing to do with that.
58. Literally nobody has said they want the government to be entirely in control of petrol. We're talking about a couple of fuel stations to drive competition in an effort to keep prices of private vendors down. What the fuck does that have to do with fascism? Dumb prick
59. We *were* taking a cut from what is mined under the Miles government and it was subsidising electricity costs and public transport and was slated to subsidise bulk billing GP clinics and feeding school kids. The LNP have promised to reverse that. This is why people vote against their own interests.... FUCK
60. Bro discovered the word "sanctimonious" yesterday and can't stop using it in an effort to try and boast what little intellect he has, like an insecure high school kid. I'm allowed to be upset by an election result fuckwit, your hurr derr statement of "majority wins suck it up" makes no difference to how I and many others feel. I wasn't questioning the integrity of the election result.
61. I know you never said it was free, the clown I first replied to said it was free. And as for my false information, I was correct it was added to another bill but I didn't realise it had been taken off the electricity bill and put on the rates. I have to get them both out and have a look. So If someone owns multiple properties then they are paying multiple times for the ambulance levy(tax) then?
62. Now you're getting abusive. Every generation manages to produce the exploiting class. Mine is no exception, nor will yours be.
63. Think in terms of class, not age. We all know LNP skews older, but blaming a generation doesn't help anything. The senior leadership of ALP are boomers. Boomers arent a class, they aren't a monolith. They're usually the most impacted by LNP policies too. Many in this sub are on your side, so ask yourself what distinguishes them from others their age. and your bitterness isn't helping you or anyone else. I get it, it's a tough pill to swallow. I've spent many years being bitter about this too, but your kind of thinking is exactly what creates this generational divide in the first place. Make no mistake, many of us will sound just like the boomers do in 40 years. The old shitting on the young and vice versa is a tale as old as time.
64. Who says I’m getting upset? Seriously, we boomers will be dead and gone soon. So less and less skin in the game. Many of us do care about the future. I have grand kids whose future is very much under threat. My point is that it is intellectually lazy to scape -goat a generation. And as I mentioned previously, the election results don’t back-up your hypothesis.
65. There is at least one generation that will have to pay economically for the downsizing of planetary population, because we cannot exponentially reproduce forever. Blaming people because they were born during a favourable economic period is muddleheaded. Sure, blame older voters *now* for voting for selfish decisions but, unless you're some kind of saint, you'd likely do the same thing in their circumstances. >Not everyone is as selfish as your generation champ I deliberately have gone childfree and support economic policies that benefit younger generations, such as removal of negative gearing; even though I am benefiting from negative gearing. I also support policy that benefits people yet to be born and put my money exactly where my mouth is. I donate to lobby groups for policies that I will never live to benefit from. So, tell me exactly how unselfish your generation will be. Gen Z is the largest generation in huma history and is eating the planet. How will Gen Z be remembered? The generation that saw the last tree in the Amazon? The generation that saw the last coral in the Great Barrier Reef? The generation that kept Bangladeshi climate refugees out of Australia? The generation that saw the greatest increase in extinctions in human history? That's what's coming and that's how your generation will be remembered. Is that your fault?
66. People who live week to week don't proactively save for rego mate. I know because I've been there. When you're on the edge you just pay rego when you can and live like shit until your next pay. For people in that 50 to 100 dollars means a lot.
67. Literally people telling you here it helped and your arguing it didn't, against them personally. That is the proof first hand
68. That one, tiny, first step in easing living costs? Maybe not, but combined with some other policies and incentives it could have made a difference to the people struggling the most. You go on like labour said "20% rego cut and our work here is done" then stopped thinking about the issue at all. In the next 4 years they could have introduced more policy to help ease price creep and inflated expenses, but no, we have to enable the boomers to finish fucking everything completely before they die out.
69. I was glad to read about that however knowing the LNP and their drive to privatise quite literally everything I wouldn't be surprised to see private prisons making their way back in.
70. Each to their own I guess, I would have a similar reaction if you showed me anything from Murdoch media. If you're still interested, [NSW parliament](https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/lc/papers/Pages/qanda-tracking-details.aspx?pk=96220) says it costs them $2,748.96 per day to keep a kid in juvenile detention. Which amounts to over a million dollars a year for one kid ($1,003,370.40). I'm aware this is Queensland sub but it wouldn't be a dissimilar number imo. Edit: and this is for 2021/22 under a decade old Liberal state government.
71. 100% the kids might also stay in school as well.
72. Rehabilitation isn't the only component of the corrections system. There is also a component of punishment to make offenders pay their debt to society, a violent thing eho murders a mother and stabs her husband who laughs when police arest him has a significant debt to pay to society and I dont think 15 years cuts it. This wasn't your average run of the mill kid engaging in a bit of hellraising who'll settle down as he grows up. He had 75 previous convictions recorded and was only 17, with many of these convictions for violent offences at the time he committed this murder. I'm not some cold-hearted throw the book at 10 year old and lock them up for life type. I absolutely think good intervention programs and rehabilitation are the correct decisions, but there also needs to be a big stick available to punish kids like this.
73. If as you say most of these crimes are not premeditated but crimes of impulse and situational, how do you treat the material conditions. In a sane world "severely limits your ability to reiterate.. et al" would be considered a deterrent? But it sounds as if "the culture" has integrated prison time into its acceptable bounds and thus violence and theft is a tolerable norm. Pumping effort into reversing that seems sissiffian?
