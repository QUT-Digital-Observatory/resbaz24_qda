Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. People associate Greens with environmentalism, they associate environmentalism with a higher cost of living. Greens aren't likely to get a look in right now
2. I have been in the middle on greens and pretty much everything about there platform has turned me away the last couple of years. A seeming lack of willingness to work for achievable goals, Idpol plastered all over their website, very strange or non existent plans to implement things that set huge economic precedents about how we manage our economy. Not to mention the general snakeyness i get from Max Chandler Mather, but thats a personal gripe. I also feel the Greens lost out in this election because the ALP had some very progressive policies already. Why protest vote for the greens if the ALP is already promising what you want.
3. People just going to gloss over the fact that the ALP and QLP have campaigned successfully to demonise the Greens for the last 3 years? If there is one thing the major parties are terrified of, it's not having a majority vote i.e they are scared of actual democracy.
4. Good the greens should never have more than 0 seats
5. It's because the party has been infiltrated by watermelons. Red(dit) on the inside, green on the out. Stick to environment. Queenslanders do not appreciate a socialist agenda.
6. The Greens vote hasn't changed that much (may even end up being 0.something % up, I'm too lazy to check) it's more that the specifics of preference flows and where different parties finished on the ballot are less likely to favor them. If this did end up being a wipeout for labor they propably would have won a few Brisbane seats. I think people saw the trio of federal seat wins as a permanent surge for the Greens when in reality it was a side effect of Labor's Queensland vote tanking at that election. Not sure how the Greens can improve their seat tally, maybe they can't, very possible that they've saturated the portion of Australians who will vote for a party like that and a large seat haul will continue to be very situational- I think the 20% or so in major cities who vote for them will continue to do so, but I do know that if the go in the direction of the German Greens and chase "moderate voters" by becoming imperialists on bicycles, many of those voters (myself included) will abandon them.
7. Funny I had a green candidate, one nation, and family first, I haven’t seen three of them campaign. Normally they be in the city or Northside, when they came out.
8. I know the private jet debacle turned away a few of my friends. Also the greens policies have radically changed over the last 10 years. Seems like they're trying to hop on the hot trend instead of sticking to their roots.
9. The Greens do well when they go to the grassroots, focussing on local issues and the environment. The state greens fell flat because they just didn't have a base. Left Wing voters, who might've shifted at this election, were wooed over by QLDLabor's more progressive policy initiatives. They couldn't win over the suburban moderate voters because their federal leadership has become far too occupied on divisive social issues. Maybe if their candidates focussed a bit more on the issues of their electorates they would've done better.
10. I'd say it has to do with Labor refusing to work with the Greens. Just like in Tasmania where Labor could have won minority government but refused a coalition with the Greens. And people voting left were worried about the LNP winning so they just voted Labor to get across the line.
11. Greens are too focused on being Iran's useful idiots these days.
12. I voted green in the last federal election. I didn't this time because of their anti semitism
13. The same reason why reddit turns into echo chamber and out of touch with people of conservative ( normal and rational for me) thinking. I saw people here purely downvote others without actually understanding others, which are very common in leftist circles.
14. The abortion thingy was obvious bait tbh. When you structure your entire campaign around abortion you’re only appealing to women’s issues, which isn’t a bad thing, but it is a bad thing when it’s only one political issue that only really affects a subset of women (it’s also a weaker campaign overall since we’re in Australia and don’t realistically have to worry about anti-abortion laws). Green’s did’t feel like they were sticking to their own values this election. A diversified campaign (actually diversified not corporately diversified) would’ve gone further in the voting campaign. (I still voted for them though 😒 but it was out of principle)
15. The state wide Greens vote is basically the same as it was last election (just under 10%) yet they may have 0 seats in parliament. People haven't turned away from the Greens overall, you're just seeing the reality of a single-member and ultimately non-proportional representation system.
16. My impression with them is they're trying to legislate problems away which is a dangerous move which causes more unintended consequences in years down the line, that's why I put them last. Their heart is in the right place but their implementation is dangerous
17. Because the greens are and have always been delusion people living in a fantasy land. I probably sound like a 60 year old (19 in fact). I have seen them spread totally incorrect information time and time again about industries I have worked in.
18. The second worst greens MP is qld greens, MCM has fucked their brand here in qld.
19. A great result. Exactly what they deserved with their dumb as dogshit policies.
20. The Greens have had their time and are no longer relevant.
21. Its beautiful. Good bye woke culture. The circle jerk here in their echo chamber are now realizing people have had enough of your crap. Right wing non socialist is back in full swing. Heres to a nuclear hetrosexual family. 🥂 Cheers
22. "who to blame" What's her name put me off them this time. Lydia Thorpe Seen to be too close to, sympathetic with the radical portions of ..... literally was in bed with xxxxxxxxxxxxxx and still gets paid a quarter of a million dollars by taxpayers
23. There was 0 campaign in bancroft for the greens. I was so disappointed
24. Far left siding with the far right on issues and they can't work out where they went wrong..... you couldn't make this shit up.
25. Serves those cunts right. I hope they enjoy the loot&polute LNP they helped install.
26. They tried green washing socialist policies, used populist sloganeering and appeared to move away from climate and environmental issues as their main focus, looked like a bunch of phonies and lost a lot of their traditional support. They could either change their name to the Socialist party, or go back to promoting their green policies as their main priority.
27. Too many of their members had stupid fucking time waste campaigns like “making the brisbane river swimmable” 🤮
28. I’ve thought this too- I think there is more overlap in greens/labour supporters than greens/lnp. With all the news lnp would win, I know a couple of people traditionally greens voters who switched to labour in the hope it would keep them in.
29. Yeah, a lot of this result can be chalked up to Miles pitching himself strongly as a progressive and campaigning strongly to the millennial/gen z demographics that normally support the Greens. Arguably the most left-wing Labor campaign in decades. I don’t expect to see Albanese doing the same at a federal level.
30. If the people who voted green before now vote Labor, you'd assume they put greens 2nd now which would make no diff to the current result which has the 2 horse race between lnp and greens. The reality is the lnp won maiwar off the strength of their own first preferences and nothing else or the greens just outright lost the faith of the electorate (if the lnp do ultimately win)
31. We don't have time to fuck around. And there was lots of momentum from the last election. For the greens it is not about getting as many seats as they can, it is about changing for the good.
32. > Also Miles was more progressive than standard labor, so why would a progressive vote green when they could vote for Labor (free lunch, 50c fares, etc) Because we don't have the system of the yanks, so people who would vote for progressives, would still vote for the actual progressive party? What a strange line of reasoning.
33. This is largely it. Plus they won the leafy seats in large part due to being the de-facto local teals. A big chunk of their vote swung straight from LNP to Green, which makes the local politics quite different. It's not surprising that when there's a serious chance of getting the LNP up, a large number of those voters have swung right back, especially when the federal party has been running good-is-the-enemy-of-the-perfect tactics nonstop.
34. I think they also missed the point. They were making promises that they can only implement IF they form government. So basically making false promises. They should have focused more locally on stuff they could influence/implement if they were the elected local member.
35. A good example is the problem I have with the greens on their response to housing. They told everyone there is a rent urgent crisis, a true break glass in case of an emergency, a fire that is raging needs a solution NOW. I for one believe them that yes this is an emergency, which means that I found the amount of political brokering or stalling utterly cynical. I don't care if some developers are going to make out like bandits or the Green aren't going to get their preferred public housing policy, just do something now to start building. I'd compare it to say, blocking increasing RFS budget because you aren't happy with climate change policy.
36. >It was an absurd strategy misstep to focus on broadly unpopular, unrealistic, unimplimentable, economically illiterate federal policies. As an economist who's always voted 1 greens, this 100%. Talking about price caps just makes me roll my eyes and lose respect for them. That's teenage drama student daydream bullshit, not serious credible policy to fix real world problems. The greens need to realise that there are plenty of mainstream peer reviewed last century ideas on how to further socially progressive ideals that have actually been successfully put in place the world over. There's no need to promise to reinvent the wheel with more unicorn fairy dust sprinkled onto it every election. If that's the best economic policy proposal you could come up with, maybe it's best to shut up about the economy and stick to talking about climate change or whatever else you have people with actual qualifications for.
37. > Rent freezes, This is a state issue. DUH. The fed can't force the states to do a rent freeze, only encourage them.
38. >economically illiterate federal policies. I don't know if it was the state or federal greens who suggested that the govt control the interest rate, but whoever did it was an absolute moron. I personally know 4 prior greens voters who said they couldn't vote for a party who wants to take over the RBA.
39. I find hard to believe that Sth Brisbane will stay with greens. The swing is 12% Last election greens only got that seat because the LNP picked them for preference vote.
40. I don’t think the Greens did anything particularly wrong, they just got seriously wedged this time around. I think loads of people who had been leaning either Greens or LNP a few weeks ago gravitated to Labor once the election became about protecting reproductive rights. Everything suddenly became very polarised for a lot of people and it left the Greens in no-man’s-land.
41. It was partly a poor policy presentation, but also ALP had amazing policies to support everyday households (state fuel stations, public school lunches etc). We also were offering gap-free GP visits, an increase of funding to public schools, supplemented Kindergarten and TAFE fees, as well as setting up a state bank with 1.5% lower mortgage rates than the big banks to force them to help out average Queenslanders. Also an increase of mining royalties etc.
42. Federal politics is on a knife edge. The green belt in Brisbane will fall. Chandler in Griffith and Watson in Ryan will both fall to the LNP. That will hand government to the LNP. The Greens are dead and buried. It's a good thing. We don't want the minority ruling the majority.
43. Yep. this had to be a big one. what does palestine have to do with the Greens?
44. Yep, and while noble, what exactly can one or two greens do about ending genocide on the other side of the world. Fucking nothing. Sadly.
45. I know exactly how unpopular this opinion is on this board, but if you honestly care more about your roads than your government funding/ arming genocide, - to the point where you constantly mock people for prioritising the latter, I have very little sympathy for you not getting the urban policy you want. Besides which I don't actually think state Greens candidates/ campaigner were talking about Palestine. Max has been, but he's a federal MP. Personally, I'm not even affiliated with the Greens, I'm just some random guy who is happy to vote for them as long as they remain on the right side of these issues. Cannot comprehend why social capitalist liberals like yourself are constantly blaming people like me, rather than people with actual power (Jim Chalmers, Albanese, Penny Wong) for not doing something that would probably be popular on balance (even if most Australians don't care that much) for the electoral fortunes of mediocre red liberal parties.
46. This is entirely their failing point. The greens policies are almost always set as some lofty ambition, likely to gain attention from voters, but voters know that they aren't able to actually enact any of those policies unless they're in government. Which they never will be. So their policies mean absolutely nothing, and they're unwilling to compromise on them to make any traction at all. It's entirely self defeating, with only themselves to blame for it
47. So well said! (From another working class traitor who despairs at the class snobbery and cliques in the environment movement, that prevent us from achieving better outcomes for the environment)
48. Had a similar experience in my brief time as an active member. You should run as an independent. I'd help you out.
49. Hard agree on everything you said. My overarching gripe with the Greens is they are not grounded in dealing with the world and people as they are - it's 100% my idealistic way or nothing at all. And so the result is nothing changes. There is a lack of understanding that they need to operate in the real world and that involves comprise to make progress. I saw a post from the Greens (maybe on here?) griping about Labor introducing watered-down version of their policies and I couldn't believe it was a complaint. Like... That's a win? That's exactly what you should want, that's your current role in the system and making some ground is better than none at all. Plus it makes the next step to the left a little closer and easier to take. Incremental change is change, and it's lot easier to get people on board with and make happen.
50. "intersectionality and mircoaggressions" what are you talking about? Are you referencing anything in particular?
51. Pretty much what the Greens do in most electorates. They have a natural ceiling
52. Pre poll and postal, which have significantly prefer LNP. This is why a lot of previously called labor seats are now LNP gains.
53. This. People don't appreciate it when the sitting government tries to enact policy only to have it blocked simply because it doesn't do enough. Something is better than nothing. Greens will keep losing if they don't learn this.
54. I campaigned for Labor in the last two weeks across Cooper, McConnell and Maiwar. This was definitely the conversations I had with the Green's voters swapping to Labor.
55. People not having full equity of their homes is a horrible idea even worse than having expensive homes but with full ownership.
56. Idk, with the LNP winning, people have voted AGAINST cost of living relief. So idk if the greens wanting a better version of the HAFF is the reason.
57. Unfortunately, based on Berkman's "victory" speech, they're in full denial on that, so they're going to keep suffering if they don't help pass good policy federally.
58. The Help to Buy scheme is what you're referring to right? Have you had a look at the policy? Because if you have you'd know its an atrociously ineffective scheme. You're probably right that they were punished for not letting it pass, but passing it off as good is just misinformation. The scheme itself would enable home ownership for such a slim demographic of people as to make it completely useless for solving the housing crisis. The people it does help into home ownership are going to be deeply so entrenched in debt; likely meaning housing prices will increase even further as resistance to selling will increase. Normally I wouldn't care over someone just misrepresenting a bill; but the housing crisis has caused so much damage to this country that I'm sorry but I feel I have to point that out.
59. Quite contrary, Sriranganathan's lord mayor campaign was the best result the Greens had yet in local elections. The drop in impetus for The Greens and votes for them is simply because Labor's policies had largely caught up to them in progressiveness under Miles so for progressives The Greens stopped being the only option. They needed to better differentiate themselves and Berkman was not listening to people like Sriranganthan on this matter. Also Berkman's ridiculous state owned mining company proposals spat in the face of environmentalism and weren't in line with the intent of decolonisation efforts in the party, taking regional wealth out of the Indigenous communities having their land exploited and putting it into the rest of the state. The Greens didn't go far enough and Labor met them, so Labor soaked up their votes.
60. And yet, with Sriranganathan running as their candidate for LM, Greens saw their biggest swings in the recent council election. As for genuine policies, how long have the Greens campaigned for free public transport?
61. Sri was very divisive but always seemed genuine to me I don't get that vibe from Max
62. > Yes it would be lovely to tax every big company 100% of their profits and we all get free everything forever and ever and sing Kumbaya on Queen Street but that's not real life. Can you show the Greens policy that actually suggests this? > They need to cut out the weirdos like Sri who seems to be happier as a militant than a politician and come up with some genuine policies that don't revolve around fantasy and are actually viable. What policies do you feel are pure fantasy?
63. Sri was an excellent councillor for The Gabba ward. May have had some wacky political ideals but they never seemed to take away from him showing consistent genuine care for his community.
64. And fair call too because the "Bob Brown Greens" actually had some substance, not the shit show we see from them today. The greens have made themselves irrelevant, protesting anything and everything so its actually impossible for the regular person to support them without feeling at conflict and excluded as well.
65. But that’s the point, isn’t it? In an election where there is a huge drop in ALP votes, the Greens were unable to pick up any of those votes. Of the votes that were up for grabs, none of them went to the Greens. Being the party of protest gives you a floor, but it also imposes a ceiling on how many votes the Greens can ever attract.
66. The greens hardly even push palestine. WTF are you talking about?
67. Imagine thinking that we shouldn't all care about stopping apartheid, war crimes, and genocide.
68. Labor policies felt like a Green platform this election. And because the outcome was going to be at the very best a narrow win for Labor, some people might not have wanted to give Greens the balance of power. Personally, I’m still salty over the whole Gabba situation, and the Greens are a little too gleeful in their role in turning that into a shitshow.
69. Labor won Greens votes because Labor adopted popular Greens policies. Not because Queenslanders don't understand preferential voting. > people who are usually Green voters voted for Labor out of fear of LNP, and a lot of people also fell for the "a vote for the Greens is a wasted vote/vote for LNP" rhetoric because that's what Labor constantly says. I have never heard this on here, or anywhere else. > And it works apparently because I literally saw a bunch of comments on here saying "I usually vote Greens but I'm so scared LNP will get in I'm gonna vote Labor" Again, I saw no such comments. Or maybe one or two, very rarely, that were immediately swamped by other users explaining preferential voting. Pretty wild to pretend the Greens could have a massive swing against them based on that. > and I know Labor people who say this sort of shit constantly too. No you don't. > So misrepresenting the prefential voting system is effective in convincing all the noobs who don't know better to vote for them. Sorry I'm calling bullshit on all of this.
70. Sriranganathan is not in charge of Queensland Greens and Miles is even more militant and progressive than Berkmann is, which drew votes back to Labor from The Greens.
71. > Because being a militant ideologue is not attractive to most people Yet we have LNP in power, with the christian right pushing for abortion bans.
72. None of this is true. The “big houses with yards” thing is something the LNP council did when they banned medium-density building almost everywhere in ~2018! This is just completely untrue. YES in my backyard! Please 😭 Go and look at their council campaign platform if you don’t believe me.
73. Playing university politics that don't work in the real world too
74. Agree. That’s why I voted Green in my seat that they should have won. (Greenslopes). They failed. We need some representation other than the major 2 to balance this country. I definitely don’t agree with a lot of what they say. Same as both majors.
75. Literally the opposite of what happens. More minor parties = the status quo being even more status quo. The major parties refuse to negotiate and nothing gets done.
76. Why are rent caps “batshit insane” and not “realistic”? The ACT has rent caps, landlords there can only increase rents by a maximum of CPI + 10% of CPI. Queensland could do the exact same thing, don’t even have to fully draft the bill for parliament just copy and paste. For example, this is how it *actually* works in the ACT right now… In the scenario of a tenancy starting 1st Jan 2023 and the rent increase 1st Jan 2024, and weekly rent of $500: At the start of your tenancy, the most recent CPI data was from 2022-Q4. At this time the CPI for Canberra rents was 120. The most recent CPI data from the date of the rental increase is 2023-Q4, at which time the CPI was 122.9. This gives a percentage difference of 2.42%. To find the maximum allowable change, we multiply by 110%, which is 2.66%. If your rent was previously $500 a week, it would only be able to go to a new maximum of $513 a week.
77. Is this actually true? I've never heard them mention Palestine once during their entire campaign
78. Labor did well to go with that. They turned a landslide into a narrow victory by LNP
79. You are pro genocide? That's really fucked up. (The Zionists are clearly out in full swing. Support of Palestine isn't support of terrorism, that's so fucking stupid. I know critical thinking is difficult for nationalists)
80. I hate this "a party can't govern because they have no experience governing" argument. It stinks of "entry job available: minimum requirement 3 years experience" type of expectations. How does a party get experience governing if its not elected to govern in the first place? Its not even necessarily Greens specific. If everyone followed that reasoning then may as well only ever have two parties. What a ridiculous expectation. I think we also capable of understanding the opposite as well that a party with experience governing can do a shit job too. Edit: Ah I just saw another of your comments calling the Greens communists and wanting to control all of government. Maybe too much to expect rational reasoning
81. I don’t give a shit about regional Queenslands farms. All we have to do is wait 4 years and they will want the LNP gone anyway.
82. Oh, do the Greens not have a solid set of environmental policies?
83. wtf you on about lad. This is the Brisbane sub. It’s for anyone and everything. And I voted green in my seat ya muppet. They fucked up. I’m curious on what people think.
