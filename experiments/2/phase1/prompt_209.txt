Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. So we shouldn't spend our tax dollars on.. the tax payers...?
2. What else do you propose the government do with our tax dollars and mining royalties. I’d definitely prefer to see that spent on the people in QLD. Pull your head out of your arse….
3. Government using the money we pay and it makes from assets to support the people it represents. What an unfair trade.
4. Why not make the mining companies pay for the product they sell, and give handouts with that money. Or do you like the likes of Gina and Clive to get a free ride (not like the Federal Government cares about changing the tax loopholes that mean they pay basically zero tax)?
5. We actually have record surpluses under Labor. Partly because of the mining royalties the LNP want to get rid of. “Queensland Treasurer Cameron Dick handed down the 2024-25 Budget in Parliament today, outlining a $2.746 billion turnaround from the forecast to a $564 million surplus in 2023-24. This is the state’s third operating surplus in a row, following the Queensland record $13.93 billion surplus in 2022-23.” [Source](https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/100536). And economists aren’t opposed to any of the things you mentioned. This is primarily because they tend to have a basic or better grasp of economics.
6. I don't think they would. The cost of the 50c fares is nothing compared to subsidies for the road network, and brings benefits including more money to spend elsewhere, and improved health/less health budget spending (some cities have crunched the numbers on the effects of increased walking to public transport, vs driving) I would expect the cost for school lunches could be very favorably weighed against the costs of childhood hunger and related poor school performance, behavioural issues etc That's assuming everything only has monetary value. If you consider both of those policies in terms of social and environmental value, they absolutely deliver.
7. > 50c public transport are a horrendous ideas This really isn't a horrible idea since cheap transport will make the economy work more better since more people with money in their pocket means more money that can be spent on goods and services or to get to work especially if they can now actually afford to get out and about. If you were a small business why wouldn't you want more possible paying customers. The fares have been largely subsidised for many of the routes anyways. Also the benefit of less cars on the roads. > > most would also quibble free lunches for everyone. Free lunches for kids. Means children don't go hungry, have the energy to learn, less inequity, and parents would have more time to you know, go work, and have money to spend on something else.
8. 50c public transport meant that people were moving around more and spending their money so that overpriced cafe in the towns/cities can stay afloat - a fantastic economic policy. Free lunches reduce crime - if the kids go to school just for a feed it's more likely they will stay for the day and not be out shoplifting/loitering. They aren't being funded by debt - If we actually got our fair share of mining royalties for OUR coal it would fund a lot more. What would you do better? the numbers don't lie, labor have been pretty strong economic managers, better than lnp. Rather than repeat soundbytes you heard perhaps look at some data and see if your opinion changes.
9. I understood that coal royalties would help, didn't we get a fair few billion from the increases already?
10. >Almost every economist would say... Are you able to substantiate this? >At a time when these policies will be funded by debt Are these not being funded by mining royalties? The same thing that gave Queensland the largest budget surplus ever reported by an Australian state in the history of Australia.
11. exactly my thoughts if he just stuck to agrarian policies and not the other crap
12. Sometimes, sacrifices have to made hell he even supported the unions from one nation one time
13. Which means that they are happy to have abortion banned as long as they get what they want. Sounds more like selfishness than stupidity.
14. We were talking about this at work the other. It would make more sense for everyone to vote for the actual outcome of a vote rather than voting for a party purely on the basis of that's who you usually vote for and let them basically decide what policies they see fit.
15. If they were honest about their policies (that would be an interesting exercise too) it would be fairly easy to pick the party.
16. It's because as a party you debate these things in private and show solidarity in public. Hard to respect the LNP when you don't get a clear response on an issue
17. then there is no point voting for someone that is a member of a party - better to vote independent.
18. It’s okay to have a diversity of views, but at the end of the day only one policy gets voted in so a party line gives people transparency in what they are voting for.
19. Sorry to hear that. What was the situation for you? Parents couldn’t afford to buy breakfast/lunch food? Prioritised other things? Or didn’t understand the need to for adequate nutrition?
20. I never said I want to defund anything? I support the policy lol
21. The royalties will not be hanging around as they are based on a sliding scale. Commodity prices have significantly lowered and so will the royalty rates so bye bye super profits royalties.
22. Not true, Miles has stated that the free lunches will be paid for by more lending
23. Pigs arse they paid off debt. The state debt rose while claiming they produced a surplus.
24. Surpluses yes, but debt is increasing. There are billions of off the books projects and works that are increasing the debt You can see here https://budget.qld.gov.au/overview/economic-and-fiscal-overview/
25. By having to pay well over $1b/year just in interest. And this is set to rise significantly into the future if we do not get spending under control. [https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/election-giveaways-put-queensland-s-credit-rating-at-risk-20241014-p5ki25](https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/election-giveaways-put-queensland-s-credit-rating-at-risk-20241014-p5ki25)
26. Apparently the Australia Institute went to the parallel world where the movie Idiocracy was filmed and surveyed those people. Or they surveyed greens voters. Same thing really. You can not grow a state based on stealing money from the productive people and hand it to the unproductive people and endless welfare. I was laughing with some public servants in their 60's being given reproductive leave by the stupid labor government. That is how spasticated state labor is. There is a reason why the bjelke-peterson government was so successful in forwarding Queensland so much with their massive infrastructure build, that was done at a reasonable cost.
27. Yeah, I know. It makes the homophobia all the more stunning. https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/katter-walks-out-of-interview-when-asked-about-gay-people/7514230
28. Tony Abbots sister is gay too, doesn’t mean a thing to bigots
29. Its all a trade off. Once you convince voters that abortion is a personal choice for women, and you know you or your partner won't need one soon, it isn't going to be more important than struggling to put healthy food on the table for your children. Other voters will say the right to an abortion is more important than fixing the economy, and the think that the LNP represent that. If Labor wins and the economy stays weak then they would call you selfish.
30. It sounds like Democracy. The stupidity comes in the ignorant pigeonholing of everyone into set groups without realising that people are allowed to have different priorities and are welcome to compromise on the lower preferences to secure the outcome they prefer.
31. That may be the way the ALP and the CCP does it... It favours voters who want a party platform handed to them, dumbed down to the dot points, and frankly it's a great way to dilute the effectiveness of a representative democracy. If you want your representatives to decide these things behind closed doors, that's your choice I guess... I mean, if a majority of elected Labor MPs were from religious backgrounds, would you be happy if they made a backroom deal to abandon the policy on abortion rights after being elected to their seats?
32. I mean... I have no issues with voting for independents if they would be the best representative of the voter's position on issues. Better to have a parliament that represents the electors than electors who feel they need to choose between two inflexible options like American politics. If someone considers it unportant for both stronger funding for policing AND access to abortions, isn't it better to have a choice of a candidate that will represent that view, then having to choose between the two issues?
33. Sure... A party line gives people who are lazy about their civic duty an easy option... which is why it works. I'd rather my representatives not be tied to a party policy that means my ballot is committed to one of two approaches dictating every single issue as though there are only two types of people, red or blue in the world. If I'm outsourcing my franchise for a period of years, I don't want to nominate a 'yes man' who is motivated by internal party politics. If we are paying a not-inconsiderable amount of money as a salary for our representatives, we deserve representatives who will consider the issues and vote according to conscience... not just based on how their boss tells them.
34. What I don't understand is the initial reluctance, I've yet to get an answer that isn't someone just being a total asshole because they hate kids. Subsidies for business good Subsidies for kids - fuck those little parasitic scum it's unhinged.
35. Same goes dick nose. The post I was **responding to** (yours), would you describe that as tribal? Or is it only tribal if a point is made that the courier mail hasn’t already “refuted” for you?
36. Do you protest when our taxpayer dollars go to subsidise corporations that makes hundreds of millions of dollars? That doesn't involve Centrelink, bud.
37. So no - taxpayer money shouldn't be spent on taxpayers. Ok, Ayn, we get it.
38. Tell us, what is your noble profession that makes you so superior and not benefit from the tax others pay?
39. Bjelke-Petersen Left office in 1987. Mate that’s 37 years ago. Developing infrastructure didn’t just suddenly halt. Oh, and here is a little snippet about your mate Joh in case you had forgotten. “Two of his state ministers, as well as the police commissioner Bjelke-Petersen had appointed and later knighted, were jailed for corruption offences and in 1991 Bjelke-Petersen, too, was tried for perjury over his evidence to the royal commission; the jury failed to reach a verdict as the jury foreman was a member of the Young Nationals and a member of the “Friends of Joh” group, and Bjelke-Petersen was deemed too old to face a second trial.”
40. But it's not being paid by productive individuals, its paid by charging mining companies the bare minimum to profit from QLD resources. You'll complain millions are being wasted on welfare and handouts to people who need them to survive, while ignoring the trillions lost from price gouging, wage theft and tax evasion.
41. > You dont pay for QLD coal There's a limit to how much coal is in the dirt and we should stand to benefit from it as much as possible since, you know, its ours? wtf
42. You're stunned by a QLD family not supporting a gay adult child that has come out?
43. absolutely agree - but if someone is a member of a party it's very telling where their beliefs lie.
44. The parties come up with policies through a process, both Labor and LNP do this. Realistically the gov will be run by one or the other of these two parties. By all means vote for an independent but it’s no more or less lazy to vote for anyone. People can still be politically and civically involved more than that, but everyone has to vote so it’s kinda nonsensical to call any vote lazier than another.
45. You're going to be very disappointed when you find out I voted Greens, both major parties can get fucked this year. So no my post was not tribal it was in direct response to OP. Also lol @ dick nose just relax you'll live a bit longer.
46. Like renewable energy companies? How much was paid to Twiggy Forest to before he pulled out of the Green hydrogen deal?
47. Old mate probably works in a gov subsidised industry, like mining or agriculture.
48. Our tax dollars should be spent where it is needed most. Not spent as a blanket 1 in all in type arrangement.
49. >Developing infrastructure didn’t just suddenly halt. How many dams has Labor built in the past thirty years? The Paradise Dam is one. You know the one that now is being completely dismantled and replaced at a cost of over a billion dollars because it was so shoddily built. How many power stations have they built? Kogan Creek is one. How many others? Now they are giving taxpayers money to super wealthy overseas corporations to privatise Queensland's electricity generation by stealth with unreliable technology. I do not give two fucks about the corruption when it comes to the infrastructure build and advancements all of Queensland benefitted from. the corruption is a different subject and has no bearing on the infrastructure build that was done with minimal debt. Let me ask you how many Labor MP's in Queensland have been jailed for raping/molesting children? It is more then one. How many Have been jailed for corruption?
50. Mining royalties only pay for a small percent of Qld GSP and even that small percent could not go towards paying down our debt. Those super profit royalties will not be there moving forward because the commodity prices have fallen so the royalty rates fall with them. There goes the surplus. We need better fiscal management of our budget now more than ever. The ALP spendathon has to stop and we need to start reducing debt.
51. Not really, more stunned that the commenter above me thinks him having a gay brother wards off homophobia. The brazen ignorance of Katter saying he would walk backwards from Bourke if there were gay people in his electorate - *that* does get more stunning when you realise he has a gay brother.
52. Yeah, in current year it's pretty weird to me personally. *"oh how backwards those people must be, yikes."*
53. I would argue that that position is a comforting delusion. Both the major parties have left and right leaning factions within them, which is why it is important to get to know your candidates. The fact that the Labor Left have come out in force insisting that the LNP's refusal to set a party policy on abortion should be interpreted as party wide support for the pro-life position is characteristic of this delusion. Indeed, just this week, a former union boss and senior ALP member gave a graduation speech arguing against gay marriage and abortion. The reality is that Labor's core still includes a staunch Catholic membership. It is difficult to reconcile 'very telling where their beliefs lie' with party platforms, devised in private, behind closed doors for the sake of appearing unified.
54. If you think your civic duty is properly discharged by walking down to the polling place, marking a piece of paper and putting it in a box, then I think you misunderstand what I mean by lazy voters. The best electorate is an informed and engaged electorate. Informed doesn't mean collecting a pamphlet off the guy campaigning at your local shops. Engaged doesn't mean just answering the door and saying hello to the people in colour coded shirts. An informed and engaged electorate know their candidates beyond the colour tie they wear to official events. The ALP know that most voters can't be bothered, which is why party policies work for them. They can then concentrate on putting diverse looking people on the ballot and hope that it attracts voters from different backgrounds based on familiar look. If you can't even rank your preferred party candidates without resorting to random allocation you are an uninformed voter.
55. If you hear “same goes dick nose” and think “that sounds angry”, you’re a fool. Just curious, are you in a city electorate? Where I live voting for the greens has about as much impact as drawing a dick on the ballot paper. Your initial comment very much is tribal btw, “I voted for the tribe with fuck all electoral prospects” doesn’t really change that.
56. I don't know - how much was paid to him?
57. So what type of corruption would it take for you to start giving a fuck?
58. There's not really anything that can be done, but what he has done is immense. The closest would be the proposal to have state run petrol stations, forcing them to actually compete. As for Colesworth not price gouging? Get real. Our entire supermarket sector is totally controlled by 2 companies, with no opportunities for competition. ColesWorth bought land suitable for supermarkets not to build on, put to prevent competitors from entering the market. Kaufland had to abandon its Australia expansion because of the lack of suitable locations.
59. > spending $50B on renewables It's an investment not a spend. Power is something that underpins the economy you need to make it work and be affordable. Coal/gas in the long run will cost more anyways due to old infrastructure needing to be replaced anyways so I don't get your issue about the money here. And "gifting" to the power companies? Are you absolutely certain the money isn't going to Qlders and not going to help in any way? edit - where tf did you even get that $50billion number anyways, it wouldn't be even in one year as well ? Probably will need more investment than that anyways haha
60. also agreed, definitely need to know the person you are voting for however if they are a member of a party that was founded on core beliefs that are incredibly against my own beliefs then It'll be a massive red flag for me and an incredibly strong reason not to vote for them, regardless of what horse-trading or 'make the party better' arguments they put forth.
61. No one said people’s civic duties starts and ends at voting. You can’t make people being engaged in political process. I’d say the can’t be bothered camp votes both ways. Fun fact, on average Left wing voters with liberal views on average have higher IQs.
62. What's with the personal attacks? Sure sounds angry to me! Na it's not tribal you're just desperate for it to be tribal or your whataboutisms are invalid. Greens actually have a shot in my electorate so swing and a miss on that one as well.
63. No sir. I work in the real world where I have to be productive to earn a living.
64. Corruption of public housing building will get his blood boil, assuming this account isn't yet another Russian bot attempting to stroke division and spread misinformation in Queensland society.
65. 12 petrol stations in SEQ will make fuel prices drop? What a joke. In Mackay we have a couple of fuel stations consistently 20c lower than everyone else. The others still charge through the nose and people still go to them. Makes bugger all difference. All it will do, is waste more tax y dollars that could have been spent elsewhere.
66. I live there broski. The only homophobes I know were the guys I work with who haven't been in touch with their own feelings since their early teens. I consider them an exception, if you're incapable of empathy then you don't get to vote on other people's love IMO. I get your point, but it's still 2024. Homophobia is laughably stupid at this point.
67. Noting that both major parties were founded 133 and 80 years ago respectively, which party has foundational beliefs that are so increadibly against your own beliefs? The only persisting positions from the original party entities are preferencing socialism on one side vs individual freedom on the other... neither of which would on face value appear to be so unreasonable as to be defined as massive red flags to anyone who isn't already attracted to 'red flags' (be they adorned with a hammer and sickle or a wonky armed cross) Interestingly, it is one possible observation that by outright rejecting candidates that could shift a less preferred party more to your own position is a wasted opportunity. I mean... we have a preferential voting model. If you lean left in a right leaning electorate it makes sense to assign your preferences to more left leaning Liberals ahead of their colleagues. Similarly, a conservative voter should be preferencing Labor-Right candidates. Elections are won in the middle ground.
68. Where’s the personal attack? Is it in the thread with us now? Your initial comment is a coalition attack line mate, do you not realise that? It’s a disingenuous statement considering that the government has released costings. Little better than a lie, for that reason. The whole statement is even more ridiculous in light of “I voted Greens actually”, what was it again? “easy to promise the world when you know you won’t win and won’t have to deliver” wasn’t it? Care to explain how that doesn’t fit the Greens to a T? Finally mate, swing and a miss? I literally asked what electorate you were in, you said you’re in one where they might get up. A city electorate perhaps? But, my word, that would be a swing **and a hit**. If you read a question and think “oh he’s made a definitive statement, I’ll get ‘im there” well, that would imply that you either can’t read very well, or are as mad as you’ve convinced yourself I am.
69. Your snide, shitty attitude adds nothing to any discussion you've ever been a part of. I hope it makes you feel big and clever but i hope you realise it's pointless and does nothing for the discussion.
70. They don't need to be everywhere, they just need to exist in a way it changes behaviour. If people are driving an extra 15 minutes because the one government fuel station is that much cheaper, those around it will need to adjust. And the fuel stations around those will need to adjust as well, and so on.
71. What do you think bulk billing is anyways. Do you go and see a doctor? The rebate is your money.
72. But here is the kicker. It is only for the SEQ. Will not make one bit of difference in regional Qld. ALP repeatedly showing contempt to the regions is the main reason they are likely to get the boot.
73. Imagine being so deflated you check someone's account for "dirt" so you can shame their hobby. Pull yourself together.
74. You sling shit, then I sling shit, then you get sooky. Are you going to be OK?
75. I didn't "sling shit" let's be realistic here. You factually were being snide and shitty. I called you out, and it upset you. Rightfully so I think, because the shoe fits and you know you can do better. I'm not sooky. Please don't misinterpret me laughing at your pathetic attempt to get a strong reaction as anything but. Please, shame me more for having the time and money to do something I enjoy. It's such an insult, lol.
76. Thanks for letting me know I got the money shot bro. The "..." really sells it. Seriously though, I say this without any malice or disdain. Take a seat and reflect on how you interact with people. Either you can do better or you can't. Both say a lot about you, but only you'll know. Best of luck mate.
77. So me questioning where our tax dollars are being spent gets you all bitter and twisted? Your an easy gee up that is for sure.
78. Did I say something to make you think I have any opinion on the question you asked? At all? Anywhere at all? Also, you keep telling me I'm upset in some way... That's called projection. You have no idea what I'm feeling and no rational reason to make any assumptions, but because you feel that way, you need me to as well. So, are you aware of your projecting, or are you in denial about it? Your last sentence just supports this btw. "You're easy to upset." You're talking about yourself.
79. Thats all you've got to say for yourself? Good, best of luck with dealing with all the stuff you're now aware of. It's rough but you'll get through it ♥️
80. Literally saying goodbye and best of luck as response to you. Pay attention or keep to yourself lol, you aren't as provoking as you want to be.
81. This dude is going to be nightmare fuel for the state. I hope the majority recognises this and does something about it so we don't have to sit through 4 years of bullshit and corruption.
82. This is prequalification to be in the lnp tho right?
83. As someone said in the r/Brisbane subreddit this is posted in... "Adult crime, adult time".
84. Australia has been desperate for a Trump style culture war machine, well here it is
85. ASIC records are public. Why is Dick referring now? I guess there must be an event coming up.
86. Just another greasy spiv on the make. There seems to be an endless supply of these clowns.
