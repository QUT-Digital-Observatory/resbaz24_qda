Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. I assume you haven't read all the parties policies. If you had, you'd see that the independents or minor parties I've voted for have clear economic and intuitive plans to the issues we are facing. We have to vote based on policy, not on emotion and what feels good. It's great to back a cause, but if they don't have a proper plan they can't be successful. That's the issue with the greens and the animal justice party. They don't have good policy decisions in place. They'd run this country into the ground. Not to mention, if I don't vote your way, I'm the enemy. That's the issue with you, you don't want democracy, you want your way. Democracy is about this sort of arguing to come to a conclusion. But you are like the MAGAs but on the opposite spectrum. Everything must be wrong if it's nit your side.
2. You were the one who sought to justify your position by referencing the current rating, hoss.
3. on the low end of the scale, it is affecting you right now by engaging in this very conversation
4. You still don’t know who I voted for 😭😭😭 But good on you for not asking. I assume you just figured I voted Greens. I don’t tell anyone how I vote, but I’m finding your defensiveness interesting. Also the over-explaining, of how I should have looked into who I was voting for. Ta.
5. You've voted your way, but to you my way is morally wrong for whatever reason. You also don't have the balls to state who you voted for. So Labor I guess.
6. Are you not engaging in this conversation? it might only be a few seconds to comment, but take into account how many comments we have had with each other, it kinda adds up even while we do other things in between. I did say it was at the low end of the scale, so maybe it's been enough time to take a shower? Actively listen to a song we enjoy? There's plenty of little activities we otherwise could do, yet we are still in a conversation of political discourse
7. I'm also engaging in the NZ test cricket as well as the rugby from last night All while doing some art I'm an a renaissance man if you will
8. Extremely defensible, they have good policies all around. Can't base a party on Pauline Hanson. She may be hard on the nose, but right or wrong, she does actually care about this country. That's more than can be said about most politicians. They're here to further themselves, not the country. Harden up princess.
9. Great! they're productive and I'm sure positive for you - I absolutely support that. I'm not sure if you're deliberately ignoring the point I'm making, but I will not press further as I don't think it is constructive for either of us anymore. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
10. No thanks, have better things to do. Tv, wine, scrolling. Don’t want to see your history.
11. Mate, looks me to be the only things you have are you and your bettas. I'm up now because I'm a shift worker. You'd be up because you have nothing else. Go vote however you feel. Don't degrade our democracy because people feel differently to you. When you ask who someone voted for, have the balls to state who you voted for. You don't have to ask about bettas, they're actually quite hardy. Just make sure they don't get too hot over the summer period.
12. They actually aren’t that hardy, they require a fair bit of care. But Alfie is fine, thanks for asking? Again, the stalking is fucking weird and a deflection from being challenged on voting for a party who are abysmal on a very basic level. So of course someone who openly votes for them would go to my posts and make of me for having……fish? And….caring for them? Many people do shift work. Make sure you take care of yourself. It shortens your life.
13. Hahaha, your fish are as soft as you are. Mine are thriving thanks to me only changing the water every other month. Less is more with them. Snails just won't stop breeding, have to sell a few, you need some?
14. You shouldn’t have that many snails in that size tank, but I guess that’s why you are trying to sell them?? I already have a snail in each tank thank you. Looks like you need to reach out to a LFS but oh, they sell them for about $1 so they probably won’t want them either. Bad husbandry to let overbreeding happen.
15. These raunchy bastards have done it on their own. Isn't enough of a market on gumtree to offload them, hahaha. I'll give them to petbarn if I can't rehome them. As I said, living conditions are too good. I only have one tank.
16. That’s why you don’t have multiples? Unless you are planning to breed. And you are lecturing me on betta upkeep 😂😂😭😭 ok. I think we are done here.
17. Mate I'm lecturing you on keeping an ecosystem. They're breeding due to an abundance of resources. They are living fine due to an abundance of them too. I'll get rid of them before it becomes an issue. My tank is healthy, the fish are fine, so are the snails. Kids are happy with it too. Don't take such a serious outlook on your fish as well as your politics. The things will run smoothly.
18. Allegedly 50c fares are staying. Expect lots of cuts to public services and jobs, and lowering royalties on resources. I also think they're canning the extension of the rail to Coolangatta? Things like that.
19. Unfortunately their actual plan is pretty unclear and vague. Abortion sounded like it was going to be an issue. But I'd have some confidence that they won't dare touch it after the Labor campaign forced them to change from dodging the question to clearly stating the laws won't change. I was worried for a bit there that they'd be in a minority government and need Katters for support, which could have pushed the issue. But I think it's relatively safe. It would look really terrible for them to change those laws. 50c fares should stay. At least for now. This is something that might be worth people writing to their new MP about. But I wouldn't be surprised to see it go in their first budget. It does seem generally quite popular though, and in the interests of not tanking their popularity in the first budget, maybe they'll stay. Who knows what's happening with the Olympics. Their plan is to come up with a plan with no extra money invested. So we shall see. It sounds like they're already back flipping on nuclear power in Queensland. Crisafuli had previously said there would be no nuclear in Queensland. Now the party line is more "nuclear agnostic" the vague "not part of our plan" and its a "federal issue". I think they're waiting for Dutton to win federally and they will flip on this and we will see nuclear being built in Queensland at the expense of other green energy projects. We shall see. They're scrapping some big hydro power projects which is a shame. They're likely scrapping the coal royalties which will mean a big chunk taken out of the budget and cuts to cost of living relief. At the moment they're talking more money for health, not cuts. So we shall see what happens there. Best of luck to them and I hope they do a good job.
20. Cuts to public services. Attacks on reproductive rights. Transfer of public money to private hands. The usual LNP stuff.
21. I'm going to have to find a new job, because there's no way that Stoker's DJAG is going to renew my funding.
22. If you own a coal mine or massive business it’s good for you. If you’re a normal person you’ll lose a lot
23. If it was good for the people, expect to see it gutted. Last time they fired 14000 public servants, this time the goal is to try to do enough damage that Labor won't be able to fix it, as was part of the goal last time.
24. They promised to keep 50 cent fares, though I wouldn’t be surprised if they cancel that given their record of bashing it until the moment Labor promised to make them permanent. Public services will suffer, that’s a given. On the other hand, I do not see how these guys would be very popular up til the next election. They campaigned on nothing but cheap slogans and getting rid of mining royalties. They’ve got nothing going for them besides crime (and even then their plans are questionable) and the fact that they’ve been out for nine years. They’ll be a useless government at best, or it’ll be Campbell Newman 2.0.
25. It’s crazy to consider that if LNP retained Labor’s mining royalties, it could cover the estimated $5 billion needed for Olympic upgrades and still have surplus funds left over after just one year. Many people may not fully grasp the scale of revenue being lost and the significant improvements that could have been funded with that money. For context, in the 2021–2022 financial year, Queensland received approximately $7.3 billion in mining royalties . Retaining even a portion of these funds could have substantial implications for public infrastructure and services. But the qld voters have spoken, apparently half the state would rather all that money goes to a few fat ass billionaires instead.
26. Short version? They will fuck everyone so hard that they won’t get back into power for a decade but a few people will make bank.
27. We need that crocodile to predict what the lnp will cut first?! Seriously though, I'm expecting them to go hard on our recent drug law reforms first. They'll cut the schoolies drug testing program first I think. They're likely to wait on abortion until the discourse cools down. They'll do that one in the background and try to sneak it through. 50c fares would be unpopular to cut so I think they'll keep that but only temporarily. Mining royalties will absolutely get cut. So will public servants. Energy rebates won't be until mid next year when they're usually applied.
28. They’re going to build a wall to keep all of the New South Welshman and Victorians out.
29. wealth disparity will increase, poverty will increase (as a result, so will crime), GDP will drop, infrastructure will be left behind, hospital wait times will increase, level of care will decrease typical conservative statistics
30. I was working at a government department last time it happened. Our project was canned and a lot of people let go. Project was to upgrade Windows servers and desktops to latest versions. Can't remember exactly the versions, but it was one of those once in 5-10 year type things. They did that pretty quickly and then within weeks were in the media complaining that Labor had given them 10 year old tech and it will cost many millions to fix. We were already in the rollout phase with maybe 6 months left and it wasn't a last minute project either, probably a few years of building, testing, training etc. My wife also worked at a government department. They moved everyone from Brisbane out to Ipswich, and made them all reapply for their jobs. It was an incredibly stressful time for everyone in that office and nobody was happy. They literally had to put security guards on to escort people from the building to the train station because of how unsafe it was in the new building. Whilst I don't agree with some of the things either of the Anna's did, it was far far better than anything Newman did during his reign of terror.
31. Basically they'll sell what little assets the state has (even though they make money) cut royalties to miners. Then blame Labor for there being no money for schools and health . Pretty normal stuff .
32. It’s a very long 4 years. And the LNP has a history of some of its sitting members stepping aside/ quitting/ being investigated etc. With a possible majority of only 50, it only takes the loss of 3 members (remembering that the speaker should remain impartial) before they have to negotiate with the cross bench. Or it only takes 3 rogue LNP members to really push for their electorate. Which gapes against party lines. So watch this space I think.
33. What will happen next? Four years of moaning on the r/Brisbane sub.
34. Seriously just chill out. Worrying about stuff you don't have control on is a waste of your energy. Go volunteer your time and put that energy in to good deeds for your community.
35. Not looking forward to being a disability pensioner under an LNP State government. Less healthcare, longer wait times for urgent surgery, let alone what is considered elective. I'm so glad that I'm past menopause so my reproductive health won't be taken out of my hands by the LNP.
36. Breathe. We have elections every 4 years. We don't get hysterically scared. We move on and deal coz we are grown ups and not Americans.
37. Because it feels like the day after the 2019 Federal Election with a bunch of morons now in charge. And look how well that all went.....
38. At least the BHP don't get taxed as much. That's a net win if you're in the 0.000000001% of the population bracket
39. I suspect very little will change in the first 4 years , as it would lead to pretty much permanent political suicide for the LNP . There would be nowhere to come back from if they pull a Newman again . So it will be interesting to see how they manage. They will probably need to ring up a shit ton more debt to pull off all promises made without pulling a Newman.
40. Probably not a whole lot would change in the short term. Usually, in an election cycle, the first year comprises mandate changes - we will see youth crime laws change, for example. The second and third year are the years in which the party can be 'harsh' to get what they want out of the day. The last year goes back to 'sweeteners mode' to lure voters to vote them back in for the next term.
41. 50c fares will likely stay for a little while but they will eventually find a reason to get rid of them. They will likely sell off any of their ownership in the public transport network to attempt to reduce their annual spending. So I would expect prices of buses, trains, ferries to increase to a level higher than they were before they introduced 50c fares which in turn would mean that a lot of employees that help operate the public transport network will be laid off leading to a decrease in services. So it’s a lose lose for the people of Queensland who rely on the public transport network.
42. The LNP will change the voting system so that it advantages them. This is trumpian bullshit. We need to hit the streets for this
43. Well hopefully maybe a few people on these forums will leave Queensland seeing as we're apparently about to enter an apocalyptic era according to their comments.
44. Asking that question in this sub is not the best move if you want a broad range of viewpoints. All you need to do is read through the last 4 weeks of posts/topics to see this sub swings very far left of centre. Much scaremongering and fear-campaigning has happened the past month and a lot of people are hysterical at the moment. You'll hear comments like "They'll ban abortion" "They'll scrap mining royalties" "They'll close hospitals and schools and unferfund public services" "Remember what Newman did" "Crime isn't that bad anyway / crime was already coming down" "When are we planning to protest the new government" All of this is scaremongering over-exaggeration. No government that wants to be re-elected will ban abortion, and this government will be acutely wary of the publicity public service cuts will get. The election yesterday will change absolutely nothing on Monday, or Tuesday or even Wednesday. Judge their performance in 4 years for yourself, and if they did a good job and have good policy, consider voting for them - if not, vote for someone else. Just don't listen to any of the hysteria on Reddit.
45. Change is slow, and claims are wild. I would wager on some of them breaking promises of keeping things the royalties taxes paid for, because that Tax going isma day one priority.
46. The 50c fares will stop. They aren't sustainable. I'd like fares ro be half what they were. Our fares were too expensive. But mostly we won't see much of a difference. Housing and clinics will continue. They have to, to meet the demands of our explodng population. I'd like to see more affordable mental health services and access to allied health services for people on low to middle incomes. This is a group of people who have been hit hard by the financial crisis but have been overlooked for help. It's hard to pay taxes and levies when you get nothing back and cannot afford to pay for health care for yourself.
47. They will cut the obscene amount of essentially useless consultants providing reports that offer little apart from pages of "i cant be held responsible" Clauses. Then drop the green energy pyramid scheme and utilise existing resources "better". That means cuts and fewer dollars available for thousands. Not necessarily ALL bad, but during this current cost of living issue i dont think jobs and service cuts are a smart move, at least not all at once.
48. Permanent residents can also vote after they have been in Australia for a period of time.
49. Perhaps buses will be better coordinated now. Local and state government are both LNP and I’ve heard bus drivers saying that the state government hasn’t been funding enough buses at the start of the 50c fare.
50. Based on last time, less ambulance ramping, easier development approvals (i.e. to help with the housing crisis) and a better focus on law and order.
51. 50c will stay until they need to fill loopholes in their budget and then it will be “ohhh labor left things in such a bad state we have no other choice but to get rid of it”
52. Reminds me of the time we thought it was a good idea to suck Newman’s dick
53. >cuts to public services oh man it's already bad though :(
54. Thank fuck Labor managed to lock in things like Cross River Rail, which is nearing completion.
55. They ran on extending the Coolangatta rail to Maroochydore so I don't think they are going to cut it.
56. lol Labor had no actual plan or timeline to extend the train line to Coolangatta. In fact LNP have said they’ll extend the pool to Mooloolaba and not stop it at Caloundra like Labor planned to do.
57. I wouldn’t be surprised if they don’t do much of what they planned on doing. This wasn’t the landslide they expected and they won’t want a repeat of Newman by going super fucking hard super fast. Plus Crisafuli is already pretty unpopular so wouldn’t be surprised if they try to not rock the boat much.
58. Nice, I didn’t realise that they had nuclear as an agenda option!
59. I have a suspicion Crisafulli will be a bit more cautious than Newman was. The LNP won 78 seats in 2012 and that would normally mean at least 2 terms in government, if not more. But the LNP lost 36 of them in 2015 because of what Newman did. A 1-2 seat majority is very easy to lose at the next election *or even before 2028*. It would only take 1 or 2 by elections for the LNP to lose its majority. Remember Borbidge became Premier without a general election because of one by election. Things get complicated if he gives the LNP a conscience vote on the KAP abortion bull and 2-3 LNP members cross the floor.
60. I'm not a liberal voter but my god stop with the hysteria. If you really think the government gives money away willingly to private hands then you'll have an easy open and shut case for corruption, fraud and embezzlement.
61. My bf works in government and last time the LNP made a round of job cuts when they got voted in half his department was made redundant, then the bloody government hired them back because the workers were actually needed - but because they were made redundant they had to be fired back as ‘consultants’ for double the salary! Apparently about 4 of his bosses were made redundant in the last round of LNP cuts but they’re still in the department working now coz they just come back for more money 😂 LNP end up spending MORE money because they try and be frugal without realising there is a reason for someone in that job.
62. Just keep copy and pasting on every election post. Someone might read it.
63. Can confirm. Saw a bunch of human cages and policeman rounding up immigrants on my street about 10 mins ago.
64. 123am a police state has been announced. Martial law enacted. The state has been renamed SirJoeLand. Await further instructions.
65. I thought selling off State assets after the election was Labor’s schtick?
66. Have you looked outside this morning? Whole state is on fire. I can see Crisafulli outside my bedroom, he looks like Satan from South Park. He is yelling about 50c fares!!!! Send help.
67. I'm not worried about Wednesday next week... I'm concerned for an unspecified Wednesday any time in the next 4 years.
68. Look at how much ScoMo fucked this country and how much the LNP eroded shit for decades. Albo is nearly at the end of his term and has done almost nothing to change what was done. Even KRudd was unable to unfuck most of Howard’s bullshit. I completely get people don’t like the LNP, I certainly don’t, but it’s not going to turn into a wasteland during this election cycle. Things on the balance of probability won’t improve much if at all, but we’re not about to become Syria like the Reddit echo chamber suggests.
69. Exactly this. What we see here is wolfpack hysteria and over hyped fear for any ounce of change.
70. Public transport is a massive loss anyway, even at the stupidly high fares we were paying. You shouldn't be treating public transport as a profitable business, else you will end up with Air Train type fares everywhere.
71. The LNP has a pretty dismal track record of funding services for the poor. The LNP wants to starve the poor into extinction.
72. I wouldn't mind so much if the fewer dollars were not going to the morbidly obese at the top end of town, rather than the plebs who do all the work.
73. No they can’t. Only citizens can vote in Queensland. Permanent residents cannot vote in Queensland.
74. No loophole needed, the fair were officially on a 6 month trial - 3 months before and 3 after the election. Expect that in 3 months time there will be comments like 'it's too expensive to the budget to maintain and a poor economic choice by labor so unfortunately it has to go... it was only a trial anyway'
75. Yup. They tend to go after public doctors. I’m probably not gonna get a public specialist jobs as an addictions specialist. Will have to go private cuz of this …
76. Just to say it, you know they cancelled the Bus and Train tunnel put of spite and we'd have already had a working railway in service plus no need to lose 4 lanes of the city to the metro and southbank wouldn't be the traffic nightmare it now is... The LNP put the hard work into the rail crossing before trad moved it next door to her investment properties. (OK that was a bit partisan but that actually did happen...)
77. Oh yeah the LNP famously supports public transport and policies that help poor and average people, and definitely won’t cut them first thing after cancelling coal royalties. Definitely
78. So either this is an LNP supporter expressing what they think is an over the top comment made trying to ridicule concerns raised during the campaign or it’s someone who, like me, recalls the Joh era when much of the above was reality.
79. You just don’t do that sorta thing to your mates…
