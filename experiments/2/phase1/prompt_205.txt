Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. See that's the thing. It's a wedge, when you point out it's technically overblown as a state issue it comes across as dismissing it. To those who experience and see it, it's more real than anything else. But to me, it's not an issue I would justify throwing everything else out for to fix, and I know the LNP won't even fix it either These crimes do occur. But Labor at least provides social services that help prevent crime and reduce repeated offenders. Throwing people in jail alone, already pretty full, is not a solution by itself. But it sounds tough, quick and easy to do. The lnp will also cut those services and also police officers, which was two things they did last time. But that's the point. Every election cycle media and lnp do the same thing. They pick a targeted issue to attack, and run endlessly on it. Will they solve it, no. But they will talk a big game and make a big show of it. And then we can't even have a discussion on any actual issue, or others, because its become poisoned
2. There's been a youth crime issue for all of my 51 years, what makes it different now? I'll answer that for you, it's media, they blow up the issue of the day and create panic because they make money from it. The fact is there has been a reduction in youth crime of 18 percent since 2012.........seems like it's a big nothing burger, except of course to the victims, but as I said, they have been there forever.
3. Labor doesn't have a u in it and people will disregard your opinion if it does fyi
4. Child crime is down but hey let’s not let the truth get in the way of the msm and lnp lies! It would be good if there were trustworthy independents standing with labor and lnp so voters can vote for someone without party interests but the community interests.
5. If you think the stolen cars will stop with LNP you are dreaming.
6. Being somewhere that isn't actively abusing them, with food, out of the elements, and with people who have to pay attention to you, if not actually care? Of course for some it's gonna be better. Hell, you might even pick up a trade cert or the ability to read. And only get lightly assaulted. Still a trade some of em will make because their home life is that bad. The solution isn't abusing them more in juvi than they cop at home. It won't fix their victims to rehabilitate them, but it is much better at prevention than further abuse.
7. This sub and most Australian subs are pandering towards certain agendas. Having reasonable concerns about public safety and crime rates does not suit the agenda. I welcome the downvotes i will be recieving
8. From what I know, LNP policies are predicted to increase crime, so idk
9. I remember it as "New Leadership". But that federal government destroyed itself from the Work Choices fiasco. Ronald McDonald would have won against John Howard.
10. This is the dumbest thing I’ve read all day. Rudd got us through the entire GFC not only unscathed but we’re only one of few countries that had any market growth at all. Now id rather leverage debt to avoid an Australian market shakedown then whatever the fuck the LNP did to quadruple our overall debt over their ten years https://independentaustralia.net/politics/politics-display/coalition-adds-more-debt-in-nine-months-than-labor-did-in-under-six-years,14261
11. Yeah, there was nothing that happened in 2007-2008 that justified a lot of government stimulus spending!
12. Yeah not like there was a worldwide recession or an anything but no blame Rudd. Good one.
13. Not to the extent you think, it’s quite polarising how Rudd now sits with Rupert today and how one man can influence democracy. https://amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/02/rupert-murdoch-australia It’s also quite funny how you didn’t actually read my sentence as it was located within the decade of federal LNP and not Rudd at all…get some glasses
14. Thats debatable. Jenny was all kinds of shit. I swear she was high on cocaine most days. Troy has his problems, but arguably he hasn't done any worse than Jenny. If anything, he actually did argue on behalf of the rate payer.
15. Wish this subreddit supported gifs, nothing more appropriate that Walter White saying "Fuck you and your eyebrows"
16. Any particular reason why or are you just an angry reditor looking to be angry.
17. I always like to point out that every kid that's committing crimes is a descendant of a boomer
18. should RBA make a case and present to the parliament and then get decide if the rate should move? i really dont know if that will make any better or worse. Essentially economist working at RBA digs down the stats and figures and decide the rate. If that function moves to parliament, MPs would need to vote based on the information presented to them. (by similar background economists) Cash rate is such a brutal instrument and difficult to measure the immediate outcome, we can blame RBA for making change, but if it goes to the parliament, people will blame the parliament too. Cant win.
19. Interest rates should be outside of the RBA and Parliament. A third party should be doing it.
20. >no country has ever taxed its way to prosperity And no country has been prosperous without taxation.
21. “No country has ever taxed its way to prosperity” actually damn near every prosperous nation did *exactly* that.
22. For everyone who does not own home more social housing means better living conditions. No more horrible rentals with abusive landlords and real estate agents. However to get there we need to tax those stinky landlords and their agents and use this money to build more government owned homes for us. That is Greens policy. We have around 30% renters, its a mystery why Green vote less than that number.
23. oh i am absolutely not trying to change minds, its a meme.
24. I'd say it's not overly common for people to vote on this logic alone. If people are voting *against* Labor instead of *for* the LNP it's useful to acknowledge why this might be the case instead of throwing names around. For starters, it's pretty hard to convince people to disregard the biggest housing and cost of living crisis in living memory that, whether you like it or not, happened under Labor's watch.
25. a lot of ppl wont even read policies or research who they're voting for. so many ppl just vote for the colour and feeling. How often you hear LNP is a better economical managers, and support business, etc, when in fact opposite is true? I know few ppl vote because of this, and usually surprised to hear LNP policy is not what they want to support.
26. The only LNP policy I can see is that they’ll still tax the mining companies? The mining companies were taxed before Labor as well.
27. Both are bad, whataboutisms are bad. Why is this so hard to understand?
28. Huh, bankers are workers collectives now? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Banking_Association What's that? Thuggery? https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/sep/17/cfmeu-faces-fresh-investigations-into-alleged-corruption-in-queensland-nsw-and-sa-branches So why are they not following their promise? https://amp.abc.net.au/article/104102408#amp_ct=1729743572447&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&aoh=17297435434472&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com
29. union thugs helping people? or the corrupt thugs helping the big business? what a tough question.
30. Late term abortions of healthy pregnancies should be restricted, and that is a popular sentiment. That the uninformed are being misled by a Labor disinformation campaign is disappointing but not surprising. Only the truly sick minded believe that healthy pregnancies past the point of viability should be able to be aborted. Regarding crime, Labor have been dismissive of the issue for some time now, and with rates increasing outside of SEQ it is clear that their current approach is not working. Regarding 50c transportation, again outside SEQ there is limited benefit. Regarding public housing, how many public housing projects has Labor delivered outside SEQ, relative to population? Regarding hospitals and health, how many birthing services have closed in the last 30 years under majority Labor, and how much has hospital ramping increased? Regarding GPs, why has it gotten to the point it is at now with only a promise to fix it? Regarding school lunches, why has Labor been ignoring these neglected children until now, and why has there not been an investigation into child services ignoring mass cases of neglect? The Labor party, but Miles in particular, are ghoulish thugs. >You can't support the LNP and still claim to be a good person though. You're not a bad person for falling for Labor's lies, just ignorant. The evil would be if you still supported them after looking into the above. I don't support the LNP, I just support Labor and the Greens less. My vote went to Margie, who Labor abused and defamed after she dared to run against them. Labor are thugs.
31. Ya, in my magical fairy world both parties have good but diffrencing opinions.
32. Hard agree, it's just a fantasy world where both parties have policies that benifit the people, just with different strategies. Too much to ask for.
33. I only keep up with highlights in Japan, but haven't they had the same party for like 80% of their democracy? And they do have some severe political issues that need to be worked on. Look all I want is for 2 parties to compete with each other with policies that benifit the people, is that too much to ask? Also why would you even bring up specifically Japan?
34. stupid people can vote too, it’s part of democracy. doesn’t matter whether the current setup works or not.
35. Ah yes there is no excuse for not voting labour unless you are a rich capitalist pig?
36. Yeah I agree. I'll concede that as someone living in Brisbane, the youth crime issue might be a big reality for people living elsewhere that I just don't see. So I would understand the temptation to vote for the party who is emphasising that issue. But just using common sense, the policies the LNP are proposing to fix the issue are terrible... authoritarian punishment does not help. Some of Labor's policies e.g. free school lunches would legitimately help the issue far more.
37. It's not about abusing people, it's about making the deterrent to the crime an actual deterrent. If there is incentive to go into juvi because it's better, then they will actively continue to do the crime to get there. Hence broad daylight robberies, or breaking in while people are sleep. I don't want to ruin some kids life either, and I believe in rehabilitation, but wrong is wrong and that needs to be understood. Like I say, the real issue is the upbringing and home situation, but that doens't mean you make committing crime and it's deterrent an escape for them either. If your kid stole some shit do you reward them? I don't get it, man. I want these lost teens to figure their stuff out, but you can't essentially get rewarded for doing heinous crimes. Come on, now. Whatever we are doing now is not working, QLD Youth is up 6-7% in the last year for example. It aint working.
38. Such as pink bats? That was a winner.... There was way too much stimulus spent then and on dumb shit, just as there was over spending for Covid stimulus. All of that needs to be paid back at some point. Ahh, my grandkids problem hey. Keep the free shit rolling out/s.
39. Not to the extent I think? Some of the papers literally came out and endorsed Rudd and said it was time for a change. How is it any less extent than that? And yes, the papers endorsed Labor while the LNP were still in power.
40. Think it might be the hundreds of Australians dead as Howard followed the US in the name of his racially charged ‘Anglosphere’ across the Middle East
41. >Any particular reason why If you are asking that you are either pretty young or a rusted on conservative.
42. Turkey tried that and they went into hyper inflation. Interest rates are used mainly to control the value of the currency and everyy little change moves billions of dollars. Just earlier this year, Japan increased its interest for the first time in a decade and it caused $3 trillion dollars to return from global assets back to Japan. Central banking is pretty much black magic ran by math nerds who have to take everything into account.
43. Made no mention of removing taxes, Middle class already gets hit hard with the taxes we already have in place.
44. Right, Argentina is a great example of a country for such answer of a country not taxing itself into prosperity, before Javier took over, shows what adding more taxes when not needed looks like and the damage it does with the domino effect it takes.
45. `However to get there we need to tax those stinky landlords and their agents and use this money to build more government owned homes for us.` Yes, lets tax those who own more than just 1 home and not think of what will happen from that, like owners pulling out of the rental market all together, reducing the supply of rental properties increasing the demand even further for housing or jacking up rents to increase profit off-sett , it's not a well-thought-out policy it certainly sounds nice on paper, but it's not the answer.
46. Sure but it doesn’t take much logic to realise that cutting the coal royalties completely will put cost of living relief measures such as electricity rebates in jeopardy. Additionally cutting royalties could also jeopardise road upgrades too.
47. And can you therefore point out which QLD Labor policies directly caused said housing and cost of living crisis which affects not just QLD but the entire country?
48. They weren’t to blame for the Cost of Living crisis and have directed us through it better than the LNP could ever hope to
49.

50. Both major parties are funded by the banks. I conceded that unions can be a corrupting influence. A vote for the LNP is a vote to give away our states resources to foreign companies - Labor will tax these companies and spend that money on Qlders
51. This isn’t just about late-term abortions, is it? It includes all abortions, and suggesting that women seek late-term procedures in viable pregnancies is deeply insulting to all women. My friend needed an abortion when she was fighting for her life against sepsis; without that option, she would have left two young children behind. It's frustrating to see that reality being reframed to fit a narrative you can swallow. [https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/97218](https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/97218) Do you actually find Labors statements on what they're doing for youth crime dismissive? Regarding the claims about the 50 cents, why would you include a policy both are keeping like it's a point against them? I’m not sure why that’s relevant to your framing of Labor as evil. Are you seriously going to ignore the LNP eliminated 14,000 healthcare jobs as if that's not part of the reason? I know you can look up that it's due to a workforce shortage & declining birth rates and there's still no LNP plan to address that either especially when birth rates will continue to fall if women have no access to safe healthcare if abortion is abolished and the LNP does not expand healthcare like Labor will. The rest is just policies that genuinely benefit the state, yet you seem to downplay their importance while ignoring the fact that the LNP has no viable alternatives. This approach seems disingenuous, and it’s disappointing to see such bad faith. You know historically the LNP absolutely wreck our state. Most people's best interest is not voting LNP unless you are a corporation and the mining companies are upset their tax freeze is no longer in place. *The opposition really shouldn't stand a chance and it's frustrating to see the reasoning people are giving.* The last time they were in charge they lost 36 seats. They sold schools, stopped infrastructure, gave mines tax cuts, cut essential healthcare workers with severance just to have to rehire them months if not weeks later, tried to sell off QLD Rail, tried to sell off breast cancer screening, businesses started failing just 2 years in & their new leader is a level of corrupt having to pay 200k for stealing government money. The last time the LNP were in for more than one term we got Inquiry into Allegations of Misconduct in the Investigation of Paedophilia in Queensland from the crime and corruption commission where their leader under oath admitted to it and you voted for *that* and *against* energy rebates, publicly owned fuel stations, price caps on fuel, 10 new police beats, 900 more police, 3 new hospitals, 11 expansions on hospitals, 7 satelite hospitals, 22 more hospital beds, 16k healthcare workers, 2k ambos, 1.9b mental health plan, 50 bulk billion gov owned clinics, school based gps, manufacturing in maryborough, 37b infrastructure, bruce hwy upgrade, inland freight route, bremer river bridge, barron river bridge, bribie island bridge, cross river rail, sunshine coast direct rail, logan + GC rail expansion, fee free tafe, free tools for apprenticeships, 26b energy infrastructure, 288M at risk student support, 6 pathway colleges, 140k laptops for students, 2kstuden support staff, protecting taxation of coal & protecting human rights.
52. This! One day I hope for this fairy. But I doubt it haha
53. Pretty sure its over 90%, and my point is how good a country runs isn't determined by how often it changes, it's on the policy and how represented the public is, and Cris is no mining royalties, children in jail, and saying "I'll explain how my policy works after I am elected". What good representation.
54. You need to change the lives they currently live. And it's a bigger project than just whatever hit the headlines recently. I work with stats so there's a lot to be said about the ones on youth crime, but I also work with folk who do active research and outreach. There's a point at which unless you're going for torture and murder then detention is not a deterrent - it's safer than home AND an opportunity to learn more criminal skills. You make crime the trigger for diversion. Which works and keeps on working at much higher rates than detention. It doesn't work on everyone all the time - just like there are kids with good situations who commit crime - but overall? Diversion, outreach, proper community support and education do far more for crime prevention than increased detention rates or worse prisons.
55. It should work like that except youth don't think they'll be caught and their brains prefrontal cortex aren't developed yet to think about long term consequences. We have guns out here and you'd think that'd be the biggest deterrent and they still stole BMX bikes from our property. I watched some of the debates and the only things I saw David bring up was 3&6 month check ins & rehabilitation camps (that have already been tried and closed by Newman because they didn't work iirc) so I don't think he'll do much of anything to help. I read this though [https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/97218](https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/97218) apparently they can get 10 years for having your car so maybe it's the courts not willing to sentence them?
56. then he tried to change the terrible system made by LNP's and actually did things that a PM should do. then they changed their tune.
57. Well if we’d owned or taxed our resources like Qatar and Norway it wouldn’t be a problem would it? We’d pay it back in a minute, but nooo libs wanna sell everything off to their mates for a song.
58. Yeah Kevin shouldn’t have spent so much just because some silly GFC was ruining lives globally.
59. Your grandkids actually blame you for voting in a government that squandered the wealth of the early 2000s resources boom. Don't pretend like your concern is for their wellbeing.
60. >Such as pink bats? That was a winner Would have been if we didn't let private enterprise get involved. Also, what was the debt increase between 2013 & 2022?
61. You mean the Keynesian approach that rescued Australia from any major economic impact from the GFC? Or the Keynesian approaches that rebuilt the world following WWII? Those people can disagree all they want but the results speak for themselves.
62. So a paper endorses labor once and suddenly the world is collapsing. But when more then 50 collective Murdoch newspapers consistently endorse the LNP like they have over years and years it’s “eh who cares” (the herald sun has endorses the last 5 lnp elections for example) what fair and great media wowee
63. At least she was allowed in the building, not banned for being a lying nut job
64. Or... and just bear with me a second... I am interested. Because I am neither of those things you mention.
65. Then we put in taxes that hit high income earners and high corporate profits.
66. Yeah, because Argentina is *obviously* top of mind when you think of prosperous countries. You’re pretty obviously going to argue bad faith shite, so have a good one I’ve got better things to do.
67. >like owners pulling out of the rental market all together, The houses still exist dude, there is no net loss of housing if an investment property owner sells up.
68. oh well, how will you solve the problem then? Do nothing and let landlords take increasing advantage from the current situation?
69. Entire western world really. Cost of living and housing scarcity impact every western nation in a similar way, as if there is some common cause that affects them al. Mu5t B3 qLd LaboUR!
70. This is federal but does affect us all but, one would be the fact that Albo tripled the number of migrants entering the country greatly exacerbating the housing crisis.
71. Free from new ways to tax them? So not free from the old taxes?
72. The beauty of a preferential voting system is that I don't have to vote either LNP or Labor, I can vote for who I want, and then decesendinly preference my least favourite parties starting with, for example, socialist alliances type psychos, greens, and Labor. That the LNP appear above Labor is just a symptom of my dislike of them being slightly less than absolute loathing of the Labor thugs. And you are the one being disingenuous regarding abortion. You know, or should know if you are this invested, that under the previous laws such cases as you mention would be allowed anyway, and in fact allowing such procedures is in line with even the *Catholic Church's* laws on abortion.
73. Like imagine 2 parties coming up with competing ideas about how to best serve the public, rather then one party that is 50/50 and one that's sole purpose is to line their pockets.
74. Yeah, but Japan isn't a perfect country to point to, their treatment of elderly and disabled people is almost criminal, plus they have zero to no immigration. My idea wasn't we should let liberal in, my point is there should be 2 parties for the people with differing strategies. What's the point of democracy when only one party is above the compentcy mark.
75. That is the long term solution, yes, but something needs to change in the immediate to prevent it as well. Like you mentioned earlier, some kids are picking up trade certs off the back of committing crime. Commit a crime and get a trade. What a deal! What an incentive. It makes no sense. They’re teens, they do deserve a chance to fix their life but they don’t get the right to ruin someone else’s to do that, and they shouldn’t have any incentive that points to that path. That has to change. Whether it’s stricter juvi conditions or something else, something needs to change for immediate. Not long term, immediate. Long term is a hard issue to solve and it’s not right for victims to keep suffering along the way. I don’t understand how we are in a time where people are advocating for the criminal over the victims safety.
76. >It should work like that except youth don't think they'll be caught Thats not true. They 100% know they will get caught and nothing will happen except some free food for a week. You clearly havent heard them joke and laugh as they decide who earned the most "points" for stealing the most expensive car or ramming the most cop cars when they get their post crime spree hospital checkups.
77. Of course, had nothing to do with him being exposed as being a narcissistic wanker of the highest order.
78. How about you look into who actually sold qld assets instead of regurgitating this verbal diarrhoea.
79. No need to pay it back though once things picked up hey (ALP and LNP I am talking about). Neckminuit there is another crisis so more debt to stack on top of all the other debt. When do we start paying it back?
