Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. I'm not in the business of doing the bidding of lazy cunts who can't even be bothered googling the answer or reading the news, and all this after the fucking fact. I mean it's not like they sprung the election on us this morning.
2. Don’t stress it dude, but like some other poster suggested elsewhere, keep an eye out for how this election result unfolds, it’s the best way to learn. Look through party policies and correlate claims to actual studies and how they are actually implemented. Care about your future and consider how policies affect others, not just yourself, and try your best to think long term, not just short. Side note: You’ll only get caught up in a pointless cross fire (like this one) on public forums.
3. just ignore them they’re probably seething right now because their local one nation cooker didn’t win the seat. it’s awesome that you want to understand our political system and i think asking questions online can be a great way to learn- sometimes policies make more sense when a regular person can explain how it impacts them. don’t let people like this dissuade you from trying to learn and understand the world around you, keep it up
4. Oh yeah sorry, they totally sprung the election on us this afternoon, probably why there hasn't been like a single thing in the media over the last few months about it, I totally understand why you wouldn't have been caught up until after the fact...makes sense.
5. Welcome to democracy, where you get to sook about the outcome on the internet for a few days before moving on.
6. Such is the nature of volunteer organisations, but they gotta start somewhere right? :p
7. who knows we might have time travel in 70 years, or maybe even anti aging stuff (I can dream lol)
8. Except factually prior LNP governments have been bad for Queensland. The state has been worse off at the end of their tenures than at the start, every single time.
9. Swing voters are the problem. No ideology or principles, they dead read policies or decide on matters of substance. It’s all about feelings and trivial nonsense. The depressing thing is it’s swing voters who decide elections.
10. Welcome to the post-truth, Sky News era, where Labor is always wrong and the facts don't matter.
11. This. Any time Labor tries to increase education or health funding, the LNP, Murdoch press, and 9 News start screaming about them being fiscally irresponsible. Then the LNP get in and reduce funding further.
12. …….. the things they could do to help, which they did just before the election to get votes. Why didn’t they implement those things earlier?
13. It’s for a non-voting 17 year old big boy, not asking you to step up on a podium and read out your manifesto.
14. you are aware that nobody forced you to read this post or comment on it … right ..?
15. thanks, i definitely will research alot more when i finally get the chance to vote.
16. Welcome to Democracy where we have clowns voting for the LNP who will destroy the state, At least they will be gone in a singular term corruption bandits only know how to destroy never improve.
17. I think you need to reconsider your definition of “factually”. Your opinions ain’t it
18. Do it all the time dh, it’s part of being an adult. yOuR tUrN
19. She voted for it when it passed. Abbott didn’t, he abstained. He wasn’t PM at the time. You’re full of shit.
20. Talking down to people just because they think their beliefs are superior to others? That sounds like bigotry!
21. I'll be back here next year when the Katters follow through.
22. Yep, and those staff are never coming back. By now they secured stable contracts and careers interstate or overseas or in the private sector. And.it takes a long time to find 14000 replacements in the medical sector, let alone trying to then expand to meet population growth.
23. To use your own question against you, which party was in power federally for 12 of the last 20 years?
24. Because Miles was a better leader than Anastasia and they couldn't afford it due to needing to unfuck the state after what Newman did?
25. Look you didn't care or pay attention to this a week or so ago, and the same will apply in another week or so. Let it go.
26. The actual history of the LNP in QLD isn't opinion, it is actual fact and the fact is they have historically been the most corrupt governments in Australian history or are you saying Fitzgerald was wrong?
27. He abstained when it came time for the vote. He may have contributed to money being wasted on a non-binding postal survey, the result of which he didn’t even bother voting for when it came to it.
28. She voted in favour of it in 2018. You are spamming an article from 2018 where her view is being misrepresented. She was saying that marriage can remain between a man and a woman but civil unions should be recognised in the same light.
29. If you're so sure it'll happen why not take u/EmuCanoe up for a free $100, or even $500? Why throw away free money like that?
30. So no? So you have little to no conviction in your own beliefs?
31. Libs. Now they aren’t, and we are in a shit storm.
32. Yes we should let the LNP go from government so we don't have to deal with the state being destroyed by Corruption bandits who will do a Newman era re-run.
33. Sir Joh was awesome for QLD /s (that's how you show it's sarcasm right? With the /s?)
34. **Fact*** is Dan Andrews had the most corrupt government in Australian history.
35. You said Tony Abbott, come on my friendly neighbourhood bullshit artist, justify your BS.
36. Because I'd have to doxx myself to someone who's likely lying any way? This is the internet, not my IRL friendship group.
37. Inflation started spiking and interest rates started going up in the last months of the Morrison government.
38. You realise when you try & add lame insults to the mix it means you lost the argument, right?
39. "We should let"? Bro democracy happened, there's a clear mandate, what are you going to do? Revolt?
40. Where is the gaol time for anyone associated with the Andrew’s government? Otherwise it is just your OPINION. The QLD LNP had a number of Ministers serve gaol time, this is an undeniable FACT
41. Cookers being mad about medical advice being followed in a pandemic doesn't make a government corrupt. Bjelke-Petersen and Newman were. Chrisafuli, based on his business dealings, isn't looking so hot either.
42. In 2010. When the Australian public opposed same sex marriage and supporting it was political suicide. So she took the path of civil unions instead. Then, EIGHT FUCKING YEARS LATER when she may have changed her mind but support for same sex marriage was certainly no longer political suicide, she voted in favour of it.
43. there is no argument this is a reddit comment section
44. What are you going to do when the LNP destroy queensland again, Vote for them again because you are clueless?
45. So the corruption was so bad he avoided jail. Obviously that makes it worse. Fact*
46. If you don’t understand the context of my comments I’m not surprised you’re having a hard time understanding a lot of things at the moment
47. The irony of someone cooking up their immune system with drugs and calling other people cookers isn’t lost. Fact. And I love the way you’re just gonna ignore the CFMEU. Fact.
48. Surely then he must be under active investigation, surely? Otherwise it is opinion and not fact
49. It's not a problem with me not understanding the context, it is the fact the comments are idiocy and historically illiterate. I presumed you were making fun of the "hOw cOuLd DaN aNdreWs dO tHis!" cookers but I fear I gave you too much credit.
50. Last time I checked, the CFMEU did not govern Victoria. They were however the only union getting meaningful pay and condition improvements for their members, and it turned out that the secret ingredient was crime. Conservatives are just mad that someone managed to get around the rules that are seeing every other profession go backwards relative to inflation and/or workload. The vaccines were properly tested and properly deployed. Joe Rogan and Jenny McCarthy are not experts and Bill Gates was not making you sterile with 5G nanobots.
51. According to you every opinion is just a fact… so long as you agree with it of course.
52. Actually I was making fun of labor cookers and that fact 😉 went straight over your head. Satire must suck when you’re the subject of it.
53. Lol you didn’t check very well then, the CFMEU has had Victoria under the thumb for a decade or more. That’s why construction was never locked down while the rest of Melbourne was. For 263 days. Meanwhile every construction project is delayed and over budget, both significantly. When were the vaccines tested and why were the results so poor?
54. No everything I’ve said is backed up by provable evidence which makes it what? You guessed it a fact
55. Wrong on both fronts. Construction was essential work and like other essential jobs, continued on site. Vaccines were tested and proved highly effective at preventing transmission and reducing the severity of symptoms. It's just that COVID mutated so rapidly and rampantly that the vaccines weren't a perfect cure, unlike smallpox or polio. They work like 'flu vaccines (in no small part because that's where the technology was derived from) in terms of being pretty good against specific strains, okay against most, but somewhat less useful if you get clobbered by a particularly divergent strain. The only people who think it should have resulted in 100% protection are the cookers.
56. Can you please provide the data and definition points for “most corrupt in Australian history”? Additionally can you please prove that such a definition is not open to interpretation? Thanks but didn’t think so
57. Ok drug addict, yes I do say so. Enjoy the rest of your Sunday :)
58. [Did such a good job](https://imgur.com/a/j2Kgmzs) - that graph indicates deaths took off immediately after everyone got the jab and that makes it hard to imagine a worse result for the pro vaccine community? The effectiveness rate looks to be closer to -100%. Also I notice you conveniently didn’t answer my question. Cheers to ignorance hey
59. Political party with most Ministers found guilty of corruption https://www.ccc.qld.gov.au/publications/fitzgerald-inquiry-report https://researchoutput.csu.edu.au/ws/portalfiles/portal/332311526/Official_Deviance_Exposed_An_Historical_Examination_of_Political_Scandals_in_Late_Twentieth_Century_Australia.pdf
60. You know what ended at the same time? Lockdowns. You know what increases death rate? Infection rate. You know what prevents infections? Lockdowns. Without the vaccines that death rate would have been astronomically higher. The death rate was 0.2% of the infection rate. That says that the vaccines were highly effective.
61. So you deny the claim that the most corrupt politicians don’t get found guilty? How bizarre. Anyway, my opinion is different to yours. Fact ;)
62. You’ve just made the argument that lockdowns “worked”, but not vaccines. Why did the infection rate rise so astronomically immediately after everyone got the safe and effective vaccine, especially given the vaccine was so safe and effective? Let me guess, you got multiple jabs, then got Covid, and still couldn’t join the dots. Full retard
63. Because the end of lockdowns coincided with the population reaching herd immunity. Cookers *hated* the lockdowns. The price of getting out of them was letting COVID tear through everyone like wildfire. The survival rates would have been way lower and the infection rates way higher (compounding the lower survival rates and causinga way higher death rate) without vaccines. This is basic logic.
64. Again you’ve argued that lockdown worked but vaccines didn’t. Might need to increase your level of logic from basic to at least intermediate
65. The vaccines prevented transmission by over 60% and reduced severity by 80% plus when compared to placebos.
66. Yes I do. Do you not understand how answering questions work? Cos you sure do a fair job of avoiding them. Back to it. Who?
67. During the trial phase of the vaccine, one group gets a placebo and one group does not. They are then exposed to the virus to see if it works. This is done blindly and randomly. Nobody knows who goþ what until the analysis phase. You are trying to imply people were given a placebo in the general populace.
68. I’m asking for details (a link?) to the study, not how studies normally work. Thanks
69. There are many. Depending on when you look and the variants that we're circulating, you're looking 50-60% prevention of transmission and about 80% reduction in severity of symptoms. First one that popped up: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7304a2.htm I now await your "but how can you trust science/the government?" rebuttal.
70. Nope, you’ve skipped ahead about 3 years. Going back to what we were talking about (late 2021 vaccine uptake and the results immediately thereafter), and without deflecting/projecting/denying/lying, answer the fucken question
71. https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/covid-19-vaccine-comparison https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(21)00069-0/fulltext https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/piis0140-6736(21)02183-8/fulltext "Oh but those studies weren't done in Australia! How do we know it was the same here?"
72. Holy crap. None of those links are the study to which you refer. The third link is a study sponsored by Pfizer and directly conflicts the real world data we saw in Australia. And that’s the evidence you chose to best argue your case? Cool
73. This is why nobody bothers engaging with cookers. Facts, logic, and reason are never enough. Basic science and experimental design isn't enough. They always know more than the experts, and it's always a conspiracy.
74. Means nothing coming from someone who even acknowledges how [dumb their beloved vaccine has made them](https://imgur.com/a/YyQNDGZ)
75. So not only don't you understand basic science, you have no reading comprehension. Long COVID is not related to vaccines. It's COVID.
76. Long COVID is not caused by vaccination. Statistically, each time I did get it I was prevented from getting it over 50 times by the vaccines. Statistically, my cases were less severe with the vaccine than without it. Even then I nearly needed hospitalisation both times. Odds are good that without the vaccine I'd have just died the first time I got it.
77. Yes. And molecular biologist, so I can actually understand the studies you demanded to see then rejected because they didn't suit your narrative.
78. I rejected because they literally directly conflicted real world data? Reminder, you’re the one who’s had multiple jabs and multiple instances of supposed long Covid. How does it feel? If you have the chance I recommend a chat to one of your psychology colleagues. You could chat about the following topics and how they relate to you: - The Dunning Kruger effect - Confirmation bias - Cognitive dissonance - Rationalisation - Non sequiter Could keep going but they might start charging you haha
79. The real world data shows a 0.2% mortality rate for total COVID cases over four years despite infections going absolutely berserk after lockdowns were lifted. Prior to the vaccine rollout the mortality rate was significantly higher. The mortality rate dropped from 3.2% through 2020 to 0.2% aggregate across four years in 2024. For those of you playing along at home, getting the population 95% vaxxed dropped the mortality rate by a factor of sixteen. This was always the game. Lockdowns were the interim measure until herd immunity was in place. And the mortality rate through 2020 was only that low because lockdowns were allowing hospitals to keep up with cases. If the infections had spread as they did post lockdown, a lot more people would have needed critical care at once and not been able to get it. You have no idea what you're talking about.
80. The real world data shows that some people who got multiple jabs also went on and got multiple rounds of Covid. Lol. Yes, I’m talking about you again. How does it feel? This did not happen to the unvaccinated community. The dissonance must irritate the shit out of you. The real world graph I sent earlier does not indicate we achieved herd immunity once everyone got jabbed, quite the opposite. How do you cope with your dissonance? I note in your comments that you rely on relative data instead of absolute. It implies, in your little dissonant world, that say 100 people infected and say 3 people dying from COVID is far worse that 100,000 people infected and 20 people dying because as a percentage 3/100 is higher than 20/100000. However I’d strongly disagree with you and argue that 20 people dead and 100,000 people sick is, in fact, the worse outcome. The real world data shows that hardly anyone is getting jabbed in 2024 and that lines up perfectly with a much lower infection rate and a much lower mortality rate. The exact opposite of what happened in 2021, when Covid, in your own words “went berserk” shortly after everyone got the first and second jabs. Your dissonance must be off the charts right now. Enjoy
81. Lol sadly for you I do. Whilst I focus on real world results, your argument is classic of an academic: “this is all good and well in practice but how does it work in theory?” Enjoy your long COVID pal
82. You are focused on statistically irrelevant anecdotes, assuming you're telling the truth at all. When the overwhelming majority of the population is vaccinated, you expect the overwhelming majority of the population to be getting infected. It'd just less severe. What the data actually shows is that the unvaxxed are heavily overrepresented for infection and mortality, which is expected given that they don't have the protective factor that dropped the mortality rate by a factor of 16. If things worked the way you say it did, the mortality rate would have stayed static at best.
83. I’m not theorising about how things might have worked. I’m analysing how things actually worked and it seems you’ve fundamentally entirely misunderstood what I’ve said. But not surprising, as you say you’re the one rapidly losing your IQ
84. This is Year 7 level stats and probability. You've started with an answer you want to believe is axiomatically correct and worked backwards from there, rejecting the findings of actual experts, then the studies you couldn't understand, then the basic math underpinning it. This argument is fruitless.
85. >This is Year 7 level stats and probability. No, it's retrospective data analysis whereby probability is not a function. >You've started with an answer I started with the real world data. If that annoys you it's not a me problem. >and worked backwards from there Yes, that's how data analysis works. >rejecting the findings of actual experts Appeal to authority fallacy. >then the studies you couldn't understand You provided 3 links, of which only 1 was an actual study. I understood it perfectly, and noted it directly conflicts with the real world results. You're entirely focused on how things work theoretically at the expense of how things work in practice. You've got it entirely back to front. >This argument is fruitless. When someone stubbornly ignores real world data and their own lived experiences, and relies on fallacies to make their point... yes it tends to be rather fruitless.
86. Come on, have a look at who has privatised what over the last 30 years. Sweet FA has been from the LNP. There is still a generation of geriatrics who think the Golden Casket pays for the health system despite Anna Bligh selling it 15 years ago for a price that would have kept QLD health going for about 2 weeks. The facts are that neither side of politics dare sells anything given the carry on that the ALP made over Newman plans that didn’t happen because he got the arse.
87. The LNP Literally try to privatise everything Anastasia stopped the mass privatisation of Queenslands Electricity back when she entered office. Don’t act blind when LNP privatise anything and everything in their reach. Hell Newman had plans to privatise Patient transport services back when he was in office.
88. I wasn’t aware of that, can you literally show me a list of things that the ALP has privatised in Queensland over the last 40 years and a list that the Liberals, Nationals or LNP have privatised. It will no doubt be literally astounding.
89. Don’t need to give you a list mate just watch the next four years when power goes up because he sells it, that $1000 Miles handed out to Queenslanders paying for power bringing power prices in Queensland down to an all time low, lowest across the country in-fact. I hope you liked it because it’s gone now. Watch ambulances go up for sale. Then watch him lock up the kiddos and then sell prisons off to suit him hope you liked hardened crims because thats gonna explode after this guy. Oh and that green renewable future that ALP had in place for power that was entirely tax payer funded, literally owned by you? Yeah watch that go in the bin and get sold off to some investors. Campbell Newman tried to privatise left right and centre, the only reason it didn’t happen is thanks to ALP. Found a source here on this page about two months ago someone [linked](https://www.reddit.com/r/queensland/comments/1f1j73d/what_exactly_did_campbell_newman_do_to_queensland/) a pdf with a list of things Newman did.
90. That’s a great story but you are talking about things that didn’t happen, and are not planned to happen based on things that didn’t happen 10 years ago. When Newman entered power there was an ongoing Labor driven privatisation agenda, evidenced by all the things that were actually privatised but when a non-Labor government tried to continue it, the unions, who were battered into swallowing these privatisations by the ALP were perfectly positioned to moan and carry on about it, benefiting themselves first and the ALP second and effectively shutting off all future privatisation to all flavours of future government in Queensland. Maybe jump off Reddit for a few weeks and calm down a bit mate. Whatever you do, don’t watch the US elections as I don’t reckon you’re going to like much of that either.
91. Did you look at the link? There’s a list attached to that post with well pages of things Newmans reign did that affected Queenslanders and David was apart of that government then. But okay sure have fun watching the government just do what it did 10 years ago.
92. That list is a 28 pages of badly put together horse manure including comments from social media and letters to the editor of the Courier Mail, one of the first things is about contractors not having their contracts extended i.e. people employed on a temporary basis only working on a temporary basis. It’s mainly postulation by people diametrically opposed to any form of LNP government about things that largely did not happen, a bit like what you are doing now. The real and main points were taken to an election, and the government was tipped out. And like on the weekend, the voting population is never wrong. So now no public servant, no matter if they are useless or if the work has changed or disappeared will ever be able to be removed without the howls of people sat at home or in jobs that allow them to be on social media for 6 hours a day because it suits their narrative. No public entity, no matter how much sense it makes to privatise it can ever be privatised, despite the fact that you probably have a poster on your wall of Anna Bligh, who actually privatised every single thing she could, didn’t just talk about it. I find it hard to believe that anyone is sitting there rage posting about stuff that Crisafulli has ruled out doing, and just a couple of days after he was elected! Truth of the matter is that the ALP is in trouble federally too, it’s basically neck a neck and Albo’s cozy deals with Alan Joyce to get upgrades and keep out any real airline competition will do further damage to his already weak brand. He may have grown up as a houso but certainly from his actions shows he doesn’t want anything to do with them anymore - hard to keep perspective on a cost of living crisis from the cliff top mansion or the pointy end of the Boeing. And Trump is a certainty in the states not that I really give a shit. And you think this week’s been bad for lefties!
93. I don’t care about Trump aye, I bet you own a MAGA hat too Edit: still wont change my mind on LNP, Crysty is just this years puppet of the LNP and will still pass stupid shit, strip money out of everywhere he can he is just this rounds pretty boy for the crap party called the LNP. All those points are completely valid may be poorly put together but still happened even if temporary or not and similar things will happen under this round and in four years time Queensland will bounce back when they see the LNP for what it always has been.
