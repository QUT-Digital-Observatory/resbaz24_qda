Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. Katter Party brought up the idea of opening up a conscience vote to parliament for abortion laws to be brought back into Queensland. From there the question was put towards both the main parties on whether they would allow members to take part in the vote or not, and whether or not they're for or against the idea. Labor was straight up no, against voting for it. LNP however avoided a direct response and kept up with a political answer of "not in our plan." Everyone just wanted a direct yes or no. From there a few LNP members have come out to say that they would vote for abortion laws to come back and still the LNP leader kept his political antics up and avoided a direct response.
2. Its a load of hysterical nonsense. Robbie Katter had a beef with LNP over preferences. So fired off to shit stir, that KAP would introduce a private members bill to reverse the 2017 decriminalize Abortion & VAD laws. He did it out of spite. To stir up trouble! Of course? The ALP who were tracking badly in campaign... latched onto it and the media too... Making out that the LNP were going to reverse abortion laws and said it was an attack on women blah blah blah. LNP clearly stated they had NO intention of doing anything with those laws. And even Katter who realised what a debacle he'd created, backed off & said KAP had no actual intention of doing that .it was nowhere near a priority for KAP. But ALP supporters have run with it and are going silly over it. It was all just a storm in a teacup and spin😯
3. GC will never swing to Labor, too many cashed up retirees.
4. With respect to regional and rural Qld, it’s a bit unfair to attack them over being uneducated when they have been systematically disadvantaged when it comes to essential services. Both parties have had the chance to improve educational outcomes out bush and haven’t done a lot. We’ve reaped what we’ve sown.
5. It makes a world of difference, what planet are you on lol - I hate this nonsense. "Oh one side had a comprehensive suite of policies to keep generation in public hands, get paid for a resources, continue to fix health care that was demolished, feed disadvantaged kids and give people of all wealth access to transportation, the other side said... I dunno youth crime out of control or something" YEP TOTALLY THE SAME STUFF HERE PEOPLE
6. It's a decent win but not a landslide. Polls were clearly pointing to a 58-42 or 57-43 split a few weeks ago so the campaign did shift things a bit.
7. Compared to the predictions a few weeks ago where people were expecting a Newman level wipeout, it's close.
8. Oh, do you mean the exact reason why newman bankrupted the state in the first place? Huh, who would have thought the microwaved brains of queenslanders would forget about that one ay
9. Hopefully the upside if they do is to pump out more coal production to make sure we use our vast resources and realise that value before all the renewables take over
10. The LNP say yes, but things like that are funded by the progressive coal royalties which they have committed to abolish. So, no. They will cut government services, and this one is a no brainer for a right wing mob. Queenslanders will once again stop benefiting from Queensland’s resources.
11. Thankfully they’re limited there - the feds control a lot of that legislation. Wouldn’t be surprised to see a winding back of our anti-discrimination legislation though. “Gay wedding cake” laws anyone?
12. Couldn’t agree more and these idiots voted the same MPS in who kept them in the same poor conditions for the last 10 years
13. They already backtracked on their stance last night. They went from “No Nuclear” during the campaign to “It’s a federal issue” last night. They couldn’t even wait until the election had been called to show their true colours.
14. How very Trump like - please accept the results of our democratic process
15. > Public support for abortion is over 65%, it wold be political suicide to back track laws On one hand, the LNP is pretty much always just a one-term government in Queensland so they just get in, fuck up as much as they can and then screech from opposition for another decade. On the other hand, Crisafulli's speech last night had a lot of inferences to him wanting to win a 2nd term in four years' time. I'm actually hoping he tries to do that because it means the state won't get fucked as hard for the first 4 years.
16. Forgive me for not trusting the words spoken by a habitual liar within the last couple days of a campaign cycle after he refused to answer that exact same question literally hundreds of times in the weeks preceding.
17. Before the Abortion stunt, the LNP was thought to have a very one sided victory. 18 seat difference can still be seen as one sided, but who knows how much of a difference it would have been if it wasn't brought up.
18. Old boomy is back telling us how he thinks parliament works boys and girls
19. It's a conscience vote. Which means it's up to each person. And a few LNP members have stated that they're anti-abortion. The LNP haven't outright stated they're against.
20. Not to say Labor is the best party in government, getting past the initial views, they're all as bad as each other. But in the short time Miles was premier, he was looking at a lot of ways to help with the cost of living. 50c fares, rebates, potentially free lunches. At no time have I seen any real plans from the LNP. Yes, we need a change every so often, just to keep those in power in check. It's what led to today's result. But I also think the LNP got in because people forget what happened when they last were in. And not many of them have changed since then.
21. Man I don’t know where you are getting your info but I just googled and checked some of the metrics you have stated and they are all different to what you have stated. From all differing sources as well, me thinks you need to do more investigating. Just googling COL for Aussie cities brisbane/SE QLD is the 4th/5th best.
22. Fuck off. It’s not your, my, Robbie Katter, or David Crisafulli’s decision what choice a woman makes with her own body, in medical discussions with two medical professionals. Your claim that no change is on the table _is a lie_. Katter has said it is on the table. He has said it is not just on the table, it is a _day one priority_ for KAP. Not just that, Crisafulli refused to say he would block the LNP from voting for Katter’s bill, when we know that only three members of the LNP voted to decriminalise in the first place. People like you spreading this disinformation are the problem.
23. I like to think I'm in a similar mindset of it not coming a thing. However, it wasn't either of the ALP or LNP that originally raised it. The scary part is that the Katter party raised the matter and now has put the mind set that any other party can bring it to parliament. From there, it's up to the individual politicians through a conscience vote. That's where everyone has been targeting the LNP for a direct answer. I make this post looking for whether or not the QLD community will rally early to try and get it nipped in the butt before it does get raised in any way. Which it seems there will be this Friday. Let's hope it doesn't go further than just a political election stunt.
24. Protesting works with enough persons, obviously 5 blokes out the front of crisafulis house won’t do anything. Try 10,000 though.
25. definitely not illegal in brisbane lol we literally have a peaceful assembly act https://preview.redd.it/88dtxzscj7xd1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21bbc00e01ada805482ad7e6455057b43d9f18c2
26. The LNP isn't. But that doesn't mean other parties can't bring it up. A conscience vote can still happen. Edit: typo
27. Their support for terrorist groups in the last few weeks absolutely backfired on them.
28. ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha a circus,
29. He really shouldn't have started out with lies, fear mongering and control freakery, then.
30. We can't criticise him as premier yet but we absolutely can criticise him as a politician. He was in the Newman government. We know how he voted on different topics. We know how he's acted during the campaign. We have a pretty solid chance of being able to predict what he's going to be like in the big boy chair.
31. True but lots of people here are still scared from CN, he really really did a number on QLD and his party were just as culpable which old mate was apart of. Can’t be surprised lots of us never and tot see anyone from that group in charge of anything.
32. Hoping to get a civil debate on reddit is probably a long shot. Only had a couple of responses that actually addressed my question. Most of the responses are "XXX party is bad." Some have raised fair points, but some are just dead-end comments...
33. I was one of those relatives who had to say goodbye to my grandad via FaceTime, yet people have the audacity to downvote.
34. Do you see anyone claiming otherwise? Complaining about the state voting in fucking morons isn't the same as bashing the democratic process, shit for brains
35. Did you seriously create a Reddit account for that comment? Jesus Christ. Wtf does "head out into yourself" mean?
36. The same Europeans that voted for parties that are even more right-wing? Looking at you, Austria and Italy.
37. Do not call to or for violence in any form in comments or posts. Comments that do will be removed by mods. Do it and you’ll be banned. We're done with warning.
38. Robbie Katter has said, several times, that he will present a bill to parliament to repeal or amend the laws. LNP have not confirmed whether they would allow their members a conscience vote on the issue, but instead have used deflection and weasel words. Hence the very real fears, despite your ignorance.
39. it "wasn't an issue" in the states, either, until suddenly it was. people are right to be concerned. now more than 30 million women live without access to basic reproductive care of all kinds and can't do anything about it, despite abortion access being overwhelmingly popular even in republikkkan states.
40. I'll remind you that it was Katter who came out with the intention to change the laws during the election campaign... Labor only made it an issue during the campaign because Katter made it one.. You're right, overwhelming public support for abortion to be treated as a healthcare issue should mean the end of it. But it never will be to these people. The LNP have a history of defying overwhelming public support for these things. Out of the entire LNP party only 3 members voted to decriminalize healthcare for women. You can bet your bottom dollar these ideologues will have it repealed in the next four years.
41. Crazy because my lnp candidate in my electorate wants to change the abortion law to 16 weeks.
42. Your sponge is full mate of you didn’t see KAP spruik this shit weeks ago. Also there is an easy mechanism for the LNP to try and get hands off. Someone submits a members bill (KAP) and old mate campbell 2.0 does as conscious vote. With the conservatives in now with the numbers they can say it was the people’s choice when it most clearly is not. If they go for this is should be a referendum of all Queensland not some upperclass bunch of twits.
43. Because there are so many ways a pregnancy can go wrong where an abortion is indicted (eg. Ectopic pregnancy, complete molar pregnancy, immune system rejection of the baby). If there is too much beurocracy in the way to get an abortion in these circumstances, the mother can quickly go septic and die along with the already dead/dying baby. That is the reason why stricter abortion laws are generally a bad idea. We're already seeing mothers die or become permanently infertile or suffer permanent disability in the USA post woe v wade overturn. To answer your second question, no contraceptives are 100% effective. There is still chance of pregnancy and some contraceptive methods (eg. An IUD) can severely complicate pregnancy if they fail and may require a surgical or chemical abortion in order to resolve.
44. were they having them legally, because last time I checked abortion only recently became legal in South Australia. It has not been legal for that long in others states also. They overturned Roe vs Wade in America. That ruling was monumental, yet it was overturned. it's not a matter of if they can, because they can, the concern is if they will.
45. Absolutely psychotic. I can only imagine what you smell like.
46. A foetus is not a baby. Get fucked. It’s not your decision, it’s not mine, it’s not Robbie Katter’s, and it’s not David Crisafulli’s. It’s between a woman and her medical practitioners - and in many cases it’s a heartbreaking decision she doesn’t want to make.
47. A foetus is not an infant. Get fucked. It’s not your decision, it’s not mine, it’s not Robbie Katter’s, and it’s not David Crisafulli’s. It’s between a woman and her medical practitioners - and in many cases it’s a heartbreaking decision she doesn’t want to make.
48. So you condone mother murdering via backyard abortions and other fucked up things that proliferate in a society with illegal abortions?
49. Most of us follow science in Australia, not an imaginary little man in the sky.
50. What’s your stance on conception due to rape, incest, coercion? What’s your stance on adoption and programs to help those that are forced to have children? Have you personally ever been in the situation of a pregnancy involving a fetus that will not live outside of the womb or the death of a mother due to their inability to get a safe abortion?
51. You don't get to dictate what someone else does with their own body. Pipe down and stay in your own lane.
52. Haiti, Iraq, Congo,Sierra Leone…your list isn’t exactly a who’s who of great countries. Not sure what point you’re trying to make? Is it that we can be like these great places if we try hard enough?
53. Can't consider views of constituents if you can't see them 👀
54. You know, it’s kinda interesting. I can’t find a single vote tracker for which members voted on which bills. I found the actual Bill and related documentation (Termination of Pregnancy Bill 2018) but the government makes it super hard to work out who voted what unless you want to bore yourself to tears trying to find and read the Hansard record. Digging into it, she _did not_ vote to support the bill - which makes sense, since she’s ex-council, and new to parliament. Unfortunately, that makes her position an unknown (though, blocking a constituent gives you an idea where she stands, and frankly should be fucking illegal).
55. Bart ain’t perfect, and the LNP’s scare campaign billboards made him look like he just got in from a night on the gear (was joking about this with the Labor volunteers) but as Transport minister he’s done OK. 50c fares, smart ticketing, extending the busway on Gympie Road, and negotiating an extension of Metro to Carseldine - not bad. I have less faith in whoever LNP slots into that position.
56. Way to show that you have no idea what you're talking about.
57. He's already backtracked on resigning if youth crime doesn't fall lmao
58. He's just upset about being born at all. Now he wants everyone feel like him. Wtf are men deciding over someone else's family choices anyway?
59. He essentially has four years to do whatever the fuck he wants. I imagine he would have the numbers to recriminalise abortion if it ever came up in parliament.
60. It took all her self control to repeat the part line when interviewed last night
61. Because then they can win more elections in the future running a scare campaign against them. It's a virtuous cycle.
62. Poor fellow, getting a job where you get asked questions all day and then getting pissed when you have to answer them all day. What a muppet.
63. I truly believe the overturning of Roe in the US has given anti abortionists in this country the licence to start discussing it again. They weren't happy when it was decriminalised and remember that was only in 2018. Not that long ago.
64. As a woman I feel devastated that my rights are being discussed. That this is even something that should be up for debate, if I don’t want a child for ANY reason that should be enough not to have one. I feel like if they will take the rights from women then what minority will be next.
65. He doesn't want it. He doesn't care if it lives once it's born. He doesn't care about it's education or whether it eats but by God he wants you to birth it!! He advocates for a separation of Nth Qld from the rest of the state... don't tempt me with a good time.
66. And that's a fine example how making abortion illegal is gonna help increase actual crime ahah Honestly we deserve who we vote in at this point
67. Yup, once again we women aren't actually humans in the eyes of the right wing conservatives, we're simply a thing that exists so people can mess with our rights. I saw that David is "pro-choice" and thinks women have a right to choose, however he thinks late term abortions should be banned??? Sir late term abortions are for when it's a legitimate medical necessity. I said it before and I'll say it again, I think society would be better if we had access to MORE abortions. Why force people to be parents when they clearly don't want it?
68. >If I need an abortion and this fuck head stops me I'm giving birth to that thing in his yard and leaving it in the mailbox. No you wont
69. Yeah, no, if the LNP didn't plan to touch abortion old mate would have ruled out a conscience vote instead of refusing to answer the question 130 times. KAP are just their scapegoat Edit: and if focus groups mattered, they wouldn't be doing this over 70% of people in QLD support abortion.
70. > the libs don't need to entertain Katter to get other stuff over the line They won't be able to fully blame KAP now that they have a majority.
71. Pretty sure the LNP have floated cancelling the Olympics. I for one am on board with that. I don't want what happened to Rio to happen to Brisbane.
72. I'm actually of the opinion the LNP won't botch the planning. Big business want the Olympics so I expect they'll be more likely to push for them now that they're in power. Should be interesting to see what they go with. We already know it won't be QSAC (Good)
73. Labor is the reason the Olympics are looking like a shit show with no planning less than a decade out lol
74. Because the ALP have really done a great job planning the Olympics so far...
75. Why change a perfect strategy? Fuck I wish the second 3rd of the country read and understood more about politics..... *Faces palms*
76. Ahh... You might wanna check the Qld gov balance sheet mate.
77. Ummm. The state is already in debt. Labor were literally saying they would need to borrow more money to pay the public service. 🤨
78. >Total General Government Sector borrowings as at 30 June 2024 is forecast to be $62.0 billion [Fiscal strategy and outlook - Queensland Budget 2024-25](https://budget.qld.gov.au/files/Budget_2024-25_BP2_Fiscal_strategy_and_outlook.pdf)
79. You aren't missing anything. The changes the government made in 2022 made coal royalties more progressive and these are the changes the LNP will wind back. We will still have royalties in place. The changes did increase revenue but it was based on adding more tiers depending on the coal price. They previously went up in increments maxing with the highest royalty of 15 percent applying when the coal price is over $150 a tonne. The labor government added some extra tiers to charge 20 percent at 175, 30 percent at 225 and 40 percent at over $300. It can generate a lot of extra revenue but only if the price hits over $175 a tonne. In 2022 and 2023 it absolutely did. Was sitting at over $400 at one point. But in 2024 it's been under $175 and hasn't generated more revenue as a result. So scrapping those changes at this point won't result in any less revenue. But of course if the price goes up it will. I don't think LNP should touch it because the royalty is actually the fairest way to charge for resources. It's not based on profits but rather based on the amount of minerals mined. And it makes sense to charge more when the price is higher.
80. From what I’ve seen/experienced. Those that voted for it probably have enough money/retirement funds for cost of living to not matter to them (- quote basically directly from my dad who did a donkey vote believing his vote doesn’t matter because nothing affects him being a straight white retired male with a retirement fund and super)
81. The worst part is that it will hurt inflation figures too- and the RBA may use that as ammo to _increase_ rates to stop us spending on essentials we can’t stop spending on, rather than hold steady or reduce them. Good work, Queenslanders, this could suck. I hope Crisafulli sticks to his claim that he’ll work for Queensland, but the mining royalty thing alone leases me pessimistic.
82. My contribution to this 6) being homeless is a crime
83. There’s nothing to indicate it does or doesn’t, which is true for a lot of important topics this time round. I do remember a couple of years ago that there were a couple of politicians who tried to run on it at a state and federal level (LNP’s NSW premier at the time and the United Australia Party) and fell flat on their face as a result; I can only hope this government takes a note from that and doesn’t follow suit.
84. Sorry meant to say Conscience vote. A conscience vote allows party members to vote according to their own personal conscience rather than their political party’s own decided stance. So even though Crisafulli said LNP will not introduce the policy, a conscience vote allows the party members to vote themselves and they can still claim LNP didn’t introduce it.
85. Yeah I have several friends who work in healthcare and hospitals and my vote was for them. Disappointed to hear that some of my friends may be jobless within the next few weeks despite already being stretched thin on overtime/extra shifts
86. Housing defaults are going to skyrocket. And they will blame Labor or the tooth fairy. Consider that these will be young families and they won't have anywhere to go. A mechanic working 50 hours to pay a $700 pw loan repayment for his family to have somewhere secure. That's what you are about to see.
87. > I think there were only two or three left in parliament. 7 vs 78 or something
88. You’re right I completely forgot about all the corporate lobbying that actually fuels the conservative movement lmao
89. That's correct. I considered the cost of living to be a much more serious issue than youth crime. And unlike the LNP, Labor actually had policies to address that. Crisafulli on the other hand is promising to decimate taxes, including the mining royalties. So there goes 50c public transport fares. There's goes cheaper car rego. There goes energy bill rebates..
