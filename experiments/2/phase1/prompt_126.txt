Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. No. You're wrong. Unless you're claiming you have broken the law as a Police Officer to coerce minors to admitting to crimes in exchange for cautions? You. Can't. Be. Cautioned. As. A. Consequence. For. Rape. Even. As. A. Minor. If. A. Minor. Admits. To. Rape. They. Will. Be. Charged. As. It. Is. A. Serious. Indictable. Offence. (Once their claim that they committed rape is substantiated) Police can not just willy nilly give out cautions. If someone is accused of rape, it will be thoroughly investigated (as it is required by law) and the bare minimum that Police need is a witness testimony (preferably the victims). They can not just caution someone for a serious indictable offence because they feel like it - Which you are claiming they can. For serious offence, which rape is, police must have *credible* evidence that a crime has been committed before proceeding with any charges or diversions - This *includes* cautions. The Youth Justice Act 1992 provides avenues (such as cautions) for dealing with minors. Under the Youth Justice Act 1992, cautions are reserved for *minor offences* and can only occur after a full investigation. For a minor to be cautioned for a rape, the Police would first need to establish reasonable belief (based on evidence) that the crime occurred. If there is *no evidence*, police cannot lawfully issue a caution. Instead the investigation would need to continue until they did, or if no crime is found the case will be closed. IF the police found evidence the crime of rape occurred (which would be required to issue a caution), then the youth would be charged with rape (not cautioned), because the offence is a serious indictable offence in QLD. This is what I have explained to you. Police can't issue cautions willy nilly. They're an official police power. They're not a Police Officer going "Yea... don't do that." - They're officially recorded and can count against you if you're charged for further crimes. Having a caution recorded is not the same as a criminal conviction, but it most definitely has an official process - which if you were a Police Officer, you would know that. All of this is in the Youth Justice Act 1992. Edit: And just to emphasise how even more 'not happening' this is. Police in QPS, per their own OPM, require approval from a Detective Inspector to caution a minor for rape or attempted rape. If an officer seeks that approval, they must consider the "sufficiency of evidence", "Public interest", circumstances of the offence, wants of the victim (and their family), and the age and developmental state of both victim and offender. This would make it a **rare and exceptional** occurrence. You saying "They can and are issuing cautions for minors committing rape" is so absurd. Humans can technically fly as well, will you be jumping off the roof next thinking you're Superman? Probably not, because even you understand that it won't actually happen.
2. You lost one third of your seats, secured just 33% of the primary vote (lowest since 1908 excluding 2012), lost mackay and rockhampton and got smashed in townsville. But yeah, no I must be stupid, hardly overwhelming. Probably time to bust out the pitchforks and take to the streets and start the riot.
3. Dude, check yourself. I have no ‘obsession’ with rioting and I didn’t raise it to begin with. You did. I said people should peacefully accept the results of the election. I’m not sure what planet you’re living on, but you seem to get hot under the collar very easily (hence the propensity to riot I guess).
4. Because people like you like to co opt the term and create an image of a new born being callously killed by a flippant wicked woman. When the reality is, the majority of abortions are either heart wrenching procedures done on people trying to make the best choice for themselves and their unborn child OR it’s literally referring to the procedure to remove an already dead fetus from the womb. It’s the same word for both and you are erasing its necessity as a medical procedure by denying it Doctors did run into trouble, here you go: - 1985, R v Bayliss and Cullen, which was the main basis for abortion law in QLD for decades Between then and 2009, there were clinics available that essentially operated in a grey area however there was a drama in Cairns where a couple procured medication for an at home abortion without medical supervision. This led to a withdrawal of some existing abortion services in regional QLD due to the media coverage etc. So yes, doctors did run into legal trouble. Later in 2009, the criminal code (Section 282) was updated to protect doctors who performed any surgical procedure or provided medication for the benefit of their patient. This was not specific to abortion but again, a legal grey area that could be applied. In reality, anyone with money and resources can just nip down south.
5. As a 2nd year law student asking for casefile numbers to look up public records, you should know better. 1. Juvenile offences are not made public. 2. Sexual offences never, ever made public. As the previous commentor attempted to outline, Police Cautions are not recorded by the courts. Good luck in your future studies, I sincerely hope you pay more attention in lectures.
6. So unlike the highly skilled doctors, teachers, techies, lawyers, accountants etc. that we work with you're literally a useless politically-aligned bureaucrat sucking on the public teat. For shame
7. So you wouldn't be opposed to tightening the laws around allowing later term abortions of healthy and viable pregnancies? Because 2 cases in 116 years doesn't seem like there was much standing in the way of abortions before 2018, especially seeing as one of them was more about the legality of self medicating than anything else.
8. Juvenile offenders... are made public. Lol. Sexual offences are made public. Wtf? Hahahahahahaha. Edit: Offences*** for both, woopsies! Typed this one in a bit of a rush.
9. Well, yea. That's generally where the knowledge comes from... education. Should those who want to engage in the judicial system not have knowledge? We should sent out Police untrained? Prosecutors with no education? Judges with no experience? Acts aren't hard to read. They're available to everyone. They're divided into sections as well for easy reading. They don't read like a novel, but they're pretty short and concise so easy to follow. I gave you a basic rundown of how it works and referred to relevant sections. Though tbf, I am not the best writer. But you could just email an actually qualified person for the information you want. If you're polite they can be very understanding to those that wish to know more.
10. I would oppose anything that makes health professionals have to question the legality of the treatment. It’s not fair on them or on women for their healthcare to be in a legally grey area.
11. Righto love, you've given me a good laugh for the night, so I'll leave it there. Good luck studying the rest of your law degree.
12. No problem. I'm just gonna list a bunch of juvenile cases here if that's alright?
13. R v CM - \[2022\] QCHC 11 Since you probably won't bother to look these up, this case involved (At the time of offending) a 15 year old defendant, and a 14 year old complainant. The crime was 3 counts of rape, and the defendant was found not guilty on all 3 counts in a Judge only trial in the childrens court. R v SBY - \[2021\] QCHC 37 This case involved (At the time of offending) a 14 year old defendant and a 14 year old complainant. The crime was 2 counts of rape, and the defendant was found guilty on both counts in a judge only trial in the childrens court. R v FAX - \[2020\] QCHC 30 This case involved (At the time of offending) a 15 year old defendant and a 14 year old complainant. The crime was 1 count of rape, and the defendant was found guilty of rape in a judge only trial in the childrens court. There is 3. You may be crossing your wires. A minors \*identity\* can not be made public. Minor \*victims\* of crime could not speak on the crime they were victims of in order to protect their identity They do not include surnames, middle names, or first names in documents released to the public in order to preserve the identity of the complainants. At most you will come across a birth date, but identifying information is not included. Edit: Added in context in case you're unlikely to read them.
14. why do people think taking AWAY peoples rights makes a better democracy?!?!
15. I mean why even bother waiting a whole day before jumping the shark?
16. The part that surprises me most is that people genuinely believe the LNP would actually set out to do anything during their term
17. I'm sure it will come up, but probably best to wait until it does to have the most impact. Not that a protest really does much in and of itself.
18. Why? They got voted in. The protesting should have been at the voting booth.
19. Well I mean we have been following along in becoming a shit state for a while now I’m still annoyed about jacks law giving the police the ability to search and metal detect you in public without needing your consent oh I love getting less and less freedom to make decisions as a adult because the government has to parent all my decisions therefore making the country dumber as a whole
20. It's an emotive sideshow. It exhausts the population on a single, yet important topic, dividing passions and energy to protest other shit they're going to do. I don't think they wanted it in the election cycle, but now the election is over and they're in govt, it's a gift that will keep giving.
21. Birth rates are low atm, of course they would try to capitalise at every opportunity.
22. Someone needs to be at the rally handing out free condoms
23. Cant believe how many people got suckered in by labors extreme rhetoric and propaganda. The LNP aren't touching abortion rights. They primarily had issues with how late the legislation would allow a termination, with some religious nutters on the fringe. Calm your farm. Labor knew theyd lose, so they lied in their advertising and it clearly worked
24. Oh, Queensland, what were you thinking? I can't believe how huge the landslide was.
25. It’s not even on the table for the lnp to change the existing legislation. Fear mongering at its finest
26. Yoooo hahah you people just whip yourselves into fear 😂😂😂
27. good luck to the 15 of you who show up
28. The election is over. There is no need to parot Labour's scare campaign any more. Liberals are unlikely to do what Labor tells them to do. Abortions are already restricted. I was a Qld public hospital doctor. I did abortions in other States but not Qld. I asked my mentors why Labor didn't allow public abortions. I was told that most Labor politicians were Catholic, or went to Catholic private schools. So no public abortions Under the previous Miles Gov, abortions are tightly restricted in Qld.
29. Well since you aren't protesting about women's suffrage, I guess they should axe that first. Good job lemmings.
30. The activist tantrums about this non-issue likely did more to get the LNP elected than any of their actual policies. Great work being so insufferable that you inspire people to vote against you.
31. Crisafulli should be sequestered in a Catholic monastery. Not in politics 😡
32. This is what the tantrum throwing left do every time they lose government. They had a disruptive protest when Tony Abott became PM. They had a pussy hat rally in the USA when Donald Trump became president.
33. Action like this guarantees abortion is kept at the top of the agenda, and will give more oxygen and exposure to Katter and others to put their views forward. Unless you are confident the majority of the state is with you, I really don’t think this is a smart move.
34. Lol talk about hysterical response to nothing. What laws have changed over the weekend to support this?
35. Obviously terminating a baby because of serious problems with the unborn child is between the doctor and mother. However a healthy baby being terminated is murder. The west has a massive problem because of how countries are mismanaged and mothers are not supported during and when the child is born. Mums should be able to stay at home and raise the child . The government must increase mining taxes to fund the family if the population is to be congruent.
36. Reproductive rights are a family issue and are not isolated to women. It affects fathers, siblings, and the unborn. Saying that men don’t have a say or aren’t affected is inaccurate and insulting (Also there are boomers in the ALP). That would be like saying women don’t get a say in men’s rights, which would be equally inaccurate and insulting. It’s just designed to further divide us Also, I’m not against abortion but I do think it needs to be regulated somewhat. Seeking an abortion in the third trimester just because you have decided you don’t want to be a mum anymore is just sad 😢, or having a carte Blanche abort whenever you like is not ideal. Have caveats such as medical reasons, pregnancy as a result of rape and so on. The abortion debate has become very emotive and been labelled as this “you’re either for it all the way to birth or against it completely - either banned or not”. It is more complex than that. I recommend anyone see a little baby inside a womb during the second trimester and ask themselves if they would be happy to terminate their little life. Anyway I’m happy to have a discussion about it - conversations are better than violence
37. You know what they say about the Universe.... The more you think it, the more likely it will happen?
38. I’m going to organise an anti abortion rally at the exact same time. Who’s with me?
39. Successive governments both state and federal have been slowly chipping away at your rights for at least the last 10 years, but no one pays attention to that stuff Only difference this time is that the average person understands what abortion is.
40. You see if I can’t kill babies democracy ha failed
41. Baby's rights vs women's rights, don't be hi jacked by the professional protestors / activists who try and politicize every issue. This is a current non issue, ask yourself why these organisers want to keep it aliv3 (pun intended)
42. Laws are made by power of the parliament. Parliament is given power by the head of state or their representative (governor). The head of state is pit on the throne by the church. Religion underpins or politics. But I do agree with you, the religious nutters need to keep their extremist shut out of politics.
43. Without an upper house and with Robbie Katter and the rest of the KAP onboard. I feel like it is too.
44. Yeah, I'm hopefully leaving this soon-to-be hellhole and I'm a man. Best thing a woman could do is bolt out of here ASAP.
45. No it's not. It's still legal in Queensland. This is more a warning to say don't fuck with abortion laws if you want to keep your place next election.
46. Or ever.. Just cut the coal royalty back to pay the donors then have a few drinks and a cigar
47. 💯% this one. Otherwise its just pissing off other people when nothing has even been attempted yet.
48. It was protested all week leading up to the voting
49. Voting and protesting are two different things. They both play an important role in democracy. When voting fails, get out and protest.
50. > I can't believe how huge the landslide was. It was a *lot* less than was being predicted a few weeks out. Once Katter threw the abortion grenade into the LNP's lap, Labor made a huge comeback and closed the gap right before polling day.
51. 46% to 54% in 2pp is not huge. Seats wise 53 LNP to 34 Lab to 6 other is a fair bit. LNP ran a small target campaign which doesn't give them a strong mandate for big plans. If they do much, a lot people will likely backlash them at the next election.
52. It's on the table for Katter though, and the first two dozen times the LNP were asked how they would vote on that they refused to awnser. Oh and the LNP in SA recently pushed for laws to restrict abortion and it was only narrowly voted down. The new Preimer has also previously stated he strongly believes it should be restricted, and this is true for much of the current party.
53. “Roe v Wade is settled precedent!” - Several SCOTUS justices.
54. Because this thread is doing so well to reassure everyone there’s not enough support ..
55. I hope you’re right. LNP definitely have supporters to criminalise it. But as you said there has been nothing concrete come out yet.
56. Wanna show me a method of contraception that is 100% effective? I'll wait.
57. Pretty sure contraception fails decently regularly. Also, I haven't been raped in what, 11 years now, but I'm pretty sure a lot of rapists aren't concerned with contraception. It's been awhile though, so I might be a bit out of touch on that. 🤔
58. When were you working in qld, abortion laws changed in 2018
59. What's their scare campaign? That LNP will vote with Katter when the time comes? I'm genuinely interested about what the Labor 'scare campaign' is because I didn't see or hear anything scary leading up to the election
60. If you actually look at the location of the planned rally, it's at King George Square, a space where there are no auto traffic except occasional emergency vehicles and deliveries, which are unlikely to occur at 6pm, the planned time of the rally. Beside, where was that same vitriol during the antivax protests, where protestors regularly shut down roads for weeks and months on end.
61. You know this would be considered evidence of pre-meditation if you ever do that right?
62. Have you ever actually met a woman who has discovered that the child she longed for and is now carrying has a terrible chromosomal abnormality that means it will die shortly after birth in agony? Because I have and she had to make the decision that she didn't want her child to suffer like that and had an abortion before it reached that point and before it developed a greater capacity to feel pain. Leave these decisions for the woman and her partner and her treating health care providers. You don't have a clue what these people go through.
63. I wonder how bad your education was if you think that's what abortion is
64. The LNPs lead in the polls shrank quickly the moment this became an election issue, but you probably get off on being /r/confidentlyincorrect so you do you.
65. No one terminates up to 9 months, it’s a strawman, you can’t terminate a baby in basically any jurisdiction on earth past 30 weeks and even then that’s the most extreme outer end. Most actual jurisdictions vary from 3 to 5 months. The reason is rather simple, if you are that late in the pregnancy it’s safer to be induced and have the baby then it is to abort which is pretty much what every legal jurisdiction on earth requires. In very rare cases you might be able to have a late term abortion and generally these cases need to be endorsed by doctors for the medical safety of the mother or if the viability of the child living is no longer there. Every legislation that allows for abortion already does what you say when it comes to regulating how these procedures are chosen. On the other hand pretty much most anti abortion individuals are against any form of abortion, equating this widely held idea with a myth of a 9 month termination is like equating a fringe practically non existent belief with a belief held by a large minority of people who believe in taking away the right of a women to choose. The debate isn’t the way you are describing it and by trying to place it as such you are creating a fake centre point that gives far more merit to the anti abortion side then they deserve. Pro choice people are about giving women the right to choose to terminate pregnancy in a humane and safe procedure that saves hundreds of lives a year. Anti choice people are about forcing a women to carry to term a baby regardless of the conditions or else making it as difficult as possible to terminate in a legal manner (either by having ridiculously short periods of legal abortion or by placing a large burden on the individual seeking the operation)
66. Literally no one thinks terminating at 9 months is okay. Didn’t bother reading anything else cos that first sentence was so powerfully dumb.
67. Maybe like Carl Jung when questioned whether he believes in the existence of God, “ I don’t believe, I know”. Should he have been sequestered to a monastery?
68. Like when the antivaxxers had rallies that shut down streets for months on end when Anna was reelected?
69. So the left had a rally when Trump won, but the right stormed the capitol when he lost...and you complain about the left throwing tantrums?
70. It does not meet the legal definition of murder. Even when it was illegal it wasn't murder.
71. Abortion is healthcare and if you don’t want one, don’t get one, but the decision to get one should be between a woman, her doctor and her partner. Not you. Not the opinion of a politician. It’s a MEDICAL decision, not the decision of someone farming love from their out of touch constituents.
72. Third term abortions are very, very rare and almost always done due to severe fetal abnormalities. Third term abortions are also basically a birth, not a traditional abortion. A baby born to parents that don't want them or mentally don't have the capacity to parent them is not fair to that child. That child is at risk to develop its own trauma and anti-social behaviour. Adoption is not really a simple path in Australia and I would argue it is not a great option either. A lot of adoptees have trauma that parents are simply not equipped to deal with so you just end up with a kid with issues often times. If you want to see youth crime go down and improve the lives of actual living children, you need to make sure they are being born to families who want them and can support them.
73. Look what they're doing with painkillers. Maybe the average person won't notice, but as someone who was left with a life-threatening illness from COVID, I'm terrified how they keep bringing in more and more bans.
74. Eh I dunno. The whole issue with the LNP's stance is that it's a conscience vote, meaning the LNP MPs (the vast majority of whom are likely to support banning abortion) can vote however they want on it. However since they didn't win as big of a majority as they were expecting, the amount of LNP MPs that have to vote down Katter's bill in order for it to fail is much lower. Despite the LNP winning, them only getting a small majority was the best chance QLD has in keeping abortion legal (besides the LNP not winning, which realistically wasn't happening).
75. So why target the lnp, as you say it’s katters party bringing it forward.
76. KAP isn’t planning on introducing a bill to ban abortion, they are introducing a bill to amend current legislation to allow medical treatment/care to FAILED late term abortions (developed babies born alive), clearly outlined in [this](https://amp.abc.net.au/article/104502092) ABC article. Feel free to actually read the proposed bill [here](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/pdf/bill.first.exp/bill-2024-003)
77. abortion isnt legal federally in australia its decided per state, what point are you trying to make with this comment
78. So what? Again this isn’t on the table for the LNP, at worst it would be a conscious vote which is fair, if they want to hinge their career on it they can suffer the consequences if they are forthcoming. The LNP has been fairly and lawfully elected by a clear majority.

80. To be a smartass Abstinence is pretty effective. But in all seriousness nothing is 100% but they get close. My partner and I have never had an unplanned pregnancy and we have used different methods over the years. The impression I get is that a certain demographic use abortion as a form of contraception (I understand the contradiction), which really isn't healthy long-term. But I don't have any skin in the game, so enjoy and make the choices you feel are good for you.
