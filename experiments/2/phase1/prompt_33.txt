Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. I'm a lefty and I'll always vote left, but what is with his weird smarmy smile? It put me way off too lol. Is it poorly veiled sociopathy? Is it anxiety? He could be telling you 40,000 people died in a horrific way and he'll be smiling like a very happy pedo. It's truly offputting. Once he got into power thankfully he got better with it. It still needs work. I was devastated to see he lost.
2. Lots of friends ( even those who no longer live in Qld) give this as their reason
3. Remarkably, if employers, govt included, weren't trying to screw their employees at every opportunity, HR wouldn't have quite so many issues to deal with.
4. The cfmeu stuff turned a lot of people that I know personally.
5. > Sister who works in government ... and thats who she voted? One sec... let me future up the quote a bit... > Sister who used to work in government There we go.
6. Funny because now she will have to do more union shit because the unions will feel they need to be more aggressive and use departmental failures to grow membership.
7. I'm confused. She hates unions but has 2 daughters = voted for the lnp? Right
8. There aren't too many unionised government departments. Ive seen behind the curtain in a few. For the sake of your sister, I hope it improves.
9. Thank fuck for the union tbh. Some of those gov managers are absolute cowboys and get away with murder if not for unions helping staff get in there.
10. That's actually a fair reason. union behaviour can piss people off, especially if your job is to negotiate with them
11. interest rate went up everywhere.. not only in QLD and Australia but also around the globe!
12. I know a nurse who voted LNP because "last time Campbell Newman got in, they sacked people and then rehired them for more money, so I want that"
13. No offence intended to your mum. Like my mother (in NSW), they are equally clueless. Democracy doesn't work properly when people are fucking clueless drones.
14. My dad is hoping they will make car parks free in public hospitals.
15. Surprised she didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúthe proposed upgrade of the federal parliament‚Äôs toilets‚Äù.
16. Very good point, what‚Äôs left to conserve? Although, I think pretty much all the actual conservatives left the LNP, they adopted Labor‚Äôs position on all the moral issues.
17. Rusted on lib supporters? And yet this whole sub is full of rusted on labour supporters whinging about the election outcome ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è because democracy isn't actually fair if the other party is allowed to win üòÇ
18. I voted labour cause it where my political beliefs align more. But I was very close to being a one issue voter and going with LNP cause the way Labour caved and we're going to go through with such an embarrassing proposal really bothered me. Want to be proud of this city and we deserve better than QSAC changes.
19. Haha, i guess is the one policy where the alp were pretty weak. Qsac is a little embarrassing. The Mt Gravatt Olympics next to a bloody car dealership and Harvey Norman. Even if Labor won, my brain just couldnt expect qsac to be the final choice, and kinda expected Labor to find a reason to change tune
20. I asked my local Labor member about this on the way in to vote. He told me that a better stadium would have been back on the table after the election, it was just too much of a political hot potato to push this year. I don't necessarily trust that's true, but I guess we'll never know.
21. You're severely overestimating how many people give a shit about the Olympics
22. As a labor voter I couldn‚Äôt give a stuff about the Olympics. We have more important issues facing society that require funding, shove the Olympics and fix our problems.
23. There was HUGE pushback from the local community on the Gabba rebuild, because it would have involved displacing a local primary school and permanently removed a large local park that the community got a lot of use out of. There‚Äôs also the fact that the olympics are a huge money sink - they always go over budget, and they don‚Äôt provide benefits to local businesses. Quite the opposite actually, they reduce the number of tourists doing ‚Äútouristy‚Äù activities, because people coming to watch the olympics don‚Äôt do other stuff, and people who might want to do other stuff can‚Äôt afford to stay because the olympics is making everything super expensive. IMO super reasonable to not want to spend $2.7b to renovate a stadium, destroy a local park and displace a primary school in preparation for a one-off event that doesn‚Äôt help our economy at all, and which we would very rarely fill up outside of the olympics.
24. Couldn‚Äôt agree more. Labor lost my vote as soon as Miles made the moronic decision to hold the Olympic Games at *checks notes* Mount Gravatt. Unbelievably stupid decision.
25. A lot of clinical researchers, educators, and managers lost their jobs under Newman
26. I hope it doesn't happen to you but when the LNP released their costings (two days before the election) one of their big cost saving measures was to sack public service contractors. It's coming.
27. I'm in frontline public service and I'm also terrified right now. I've just gotten into a job I love and I'm thriving after years of burnout and poor mental health. I'm scared I'll have to go back to an industry I hate but I'm good at to make ends meet.
28. Not apparently. It's fact. It was ruthless . I am preparing myself to lose my job and my home to the weasel Crissifulli. Who refuses to actual in detail articulate his policies. Just High level nonsense. He is a nobody and it is terrifying he got in.
29. It happened to me at PA :( I truly hope we won‚Äôt see a repeat but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the same thing happens again.
30. They did. And it was fucking scary. Even perm staff got the axe. Between the sacking and the striking PA was running on fumes. Pump out permy applications now.
31. I was doing IT Helpdesk for the Dept of Justice & Attorney General, they cancelled all the contractors and kept the 3 perm staff. Who then quit because they were expected to do the work of 12 people.
32. They need to and they will, after working in healthcare there is too much hierarchy and bullshit seat warmers , get rid of the bloat and support our clinicians with more front line staff and better pay
33. I've been looking for it, basically get elected and then take whatever deal Gina Rinehart offers. And jail a bunch of kids before Christmas
34. - Jailing kids for Christmas. - "No abortions for thee, but there'll still be abortions for 'me'". I guarantee if any of these muppets in the LNP have a daughter that needs an emergency abortion in the next four years after they outlaw it, they'll still have access to it (or be flown to another state for the procedure). - Remove mining royalties. Can't have Gina mad. - Within 12 months, they'll remove 50c public transport (I suspect it will be within 6 months) - Privatise more Government assets. - Sack the Public Service. Add to the list?
35. Abortions for none.. miniature flags for the rest of us
36. gbr, Steven towards the end there got a bit cocky in how he just ignored what Chris said on abortion and pressed him like he wasn't actually answering the question. Also his little run across the gold-coast to brisbane where he at one point traveled by jet-skii felt a bit like a bit of an egotrip on the state's money.
37. Would make sense at a Federal level, no one pumps more money into defence than the Libs. Guess it‚Äôs just a matter of always voting the same way?
38. There already is a Daniels rule that prevents buses and trains from turning away kids that are waiting at the station if they don't have the money for a fare... It was implemented after the disappearance.
39. There is already a registry and new legislation was just passed making the reporting time longer‚Ä¶
40. > (Actual conversations with conservative family members And no I don‚Äôt know how labor/greens etc are responsible for any of this stuff.) To quote a relly from a christmas get together years ago when he was explaining how the bush fires are the Greens fault and I pointed out that the Greens had 0 say on the burn off policy "It's not necessarily green policy, but green thought, it infects everyone!". He mysteriously changed the topic when I asked him how does the policy infect everyone yet the Greens have never held even a minority government.
41. This stuff is literally QAnon propaganda from the USA. Far out this is embarrassing, we can‚Äôt even manufacture home grown conspiracy theories anymore
42. I actually know a guy who spouts the same shit but still votes ALP because he‚Äôs cfmeu
43. We do have a gender clinic at the Queensland Childrens Hospital that will happily prescribe puberty blockers to children. I, for one, don't think that is a good thing.
44. 50c fares only serve people in SE corner and a very few large regional centres. People in my area were really angry that instead of providing support for public transport or infrastructure in their area, or something like high speed rail to Brisbane, the money was spent on Brisbane. Labor cannot win government without the regions. No matter how much you whine about it.
45. Big lol to the idea that they have ever, or will ever, do anything to improve education!
46. Having a local govt that is not aligned with the state govt hasn't helped.
47. Will get budget blowouts due to funds flowing to vested interests over any needs of the community.
48. Imagine thinking the LNP are gonna do anything regarding public education
49. There were about 12 Green's volunteers at St Lucia. I voted late, so there were only about three of us actually voting (and one dog).
50. My local had 1 labor, 2 greens, 4 liberal volunteers. Safe Labor seat. The greens and liberals volunteers were having a nice chat when I walked by. Labor kinda on their own.
51. That‚Äôs the truth - I think as a nation we‚Äôre pretty centralist - get one party in for too long and it goes too far left or right.
52. That‚Äôs almost every time there‚Äôs a turn around in which party leads. State and federal. People just sick of whoever is in power and vote them out, not necessarily the new mob in.
53. What policy of Labor do you think contributed to said "loss"?
54. My grandparents are the same, lifetime Labor voters, and in the last 10 years or so closer to retirement they have switched to LNP.
55. Imagine being upset that we escaped the global pandemic for almost 2 years.
56. There are good policies from the LNP, and as a GRN voter myself I have to accept the leadership and see myself as a healthy opposition to move things in the direction I see fit best. But I think OP was aiming at the "Tell me about what you've heard from their peers who voted LNP who clearly had no idea about politics"
57. https://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/projects/north-brisbane-bruce-highway-western-alternative-planning It ain't being scrapped pal. More LNP lies Remindme!in 2 years
58. I'd like to say something nice in defence of Elimbah, but as a former resident of Beerwah, meh. I haven't seen the plans for a western route though, and i can't see how going through elimbah would be at risk, just from general knowledge of the area. Have you got a link to the stage 4 route you mention so i can look at it and potentially laugh?
59. Oh those 50c fares are gone come March, he only agreed to keep them going for the trial period
60. That‚Äôs becoming the Family First / One Nation base these days. LNP adopted all of Labor‚Äôs positions on the moral issues, so it‚Äôs only business/property owners in their camp now.
61. I‚Äôm also a nurse, but some comments here are a big exaggerated. The bachelor is $28,000 at three major QLD unis. Administration staff that are on a casual rate, and are beside admin/clerks are on $38 per hour. This drops when they loose their casual rate, and these are the cohort most at risk of contract losses with healthcare funding cuts The whole ‚ÄúNurses experience more occupational violence than prison guards and police officers‚Äù was a play on technicalities by some ACN professor who says that because nurses get assaulted in their workplace, they get assaulted more than police. This is because police don‚Äôt work in their office, so when they‚Äôre in the streets, it‚Äôs not ‚Äúoccupational violence‚Äù according to her
62. Heaven forbid you vote for someone known to your community to represent them.....
63. That's why that dodgy prick is still the mayor of the Gold Coast
64. And apparently there is a lot of us in the silent majority! If your life revolves around getting so bent out of shape about politics and getting involved in the tribalism of it, then you are being played by the media and social media companies who are leading you down a path for what reason? So you can all get together and band behind a ‚Äúteam‚Äù and ignore what‚Äôs really happening in the real world? Live your life, respect we won‚Äôt all agree all the time. OP asked an opinion, people give it then others try and tear them down for their opinion. A clear majority voted for the LNP because they wanted change, let‚Äôs get behind them and hope they do what they said they will. If they do it then Queensland will be all the better for it. If they don‚Äôt they will be removed at the next election‚Ä¶ I voted for them because of: 1 - Crime, they have ideas to improve it and the softly softly approach isn‚Äôt working. And I‚Äôm sure you would all have different opinions if your house got broken into and someone wielded a knife at you or a family member while you were sleeping. It‚Äôs gotta stop, the socialist approach isn‚Äôt working. 2 - Waste, they believe they can cut government waste. Look into the deals between unions and the government that the CFMEU issues have shed a little light on. We are all paying for these blowouts and sweetheart deals. Government should respect our money
65. I was fortunate enough to have been exposed to a politically engaged and socially aware head teacher that taught us to take note at a local, state, federal and global level. News sources (print local and international) and their ownership were scrutinised regularly to identify reporting bias. Mind you my early eduction took place in Europe and not in Oz; however I was publicly schooled. This raised a level of awareness in us that I think is missing from Oz school education. We prefer religious education over creating a mind that is politically engaged. When I came over here, much to my dismay, people could not even tell part local, state and federal politicians, portfolios, areas of responsibility, let alone their policies. My first GF voted on the criteria of personality when having met the candidate at Shopping centre. WTF!
66. Is this Mick? I‚Äôve met him many times and he seems like the guy you‚Äôre describing. He‚Äôs quite a slimy character and it always seemed like his electorate officer was doing all his work for him. She was always so tired. He also kicked me out of his YAC because I dared ask why he wouldn‚Äôt give nuclear a proper look. He quickly shut me down by the way with ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt need it‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs too dangerous‚Äù. Tbf I also contacted his electorate about the Voice, asking if they‚Äôd consider telling the feds to hold off on the referendum seeing how the polls had slumped. I also asked them if they could instead first legislate it and show the public how it works (because people needed to see if it would actually work before entrenching it in the constitution).
67. I didn‚Äôt vote LNP, but I definitely want to see the Trad report released. I was hoping for a hung parliament, to be honest, hoping to see some of the line-skirting politicians hung out to dry. Liberal and Labor run a protection racket for each other anyway though, so I don‚Äôt hold out much hope.
68. You‚Äôre a teacher who genuinely believes the LNP are going to improve public education?
69. I‚Äôm a nurse, also burnt out beyond belief. No wat I‚Äôd vote LNP though..
70. The LNP will definitely help you with your burnout when they sack you. Hope unemployment makes you feel loads better about jailing kids and taking away the bodily autonomy of millions of QLDers.
71. > The LNP‚Äôs document, on the other hand, focuses on helping teachers. Did it? Can you link to any part of it that actually had that focus? > The LNP government might backfire, but for my personal circumstances it was the best vote for me. Well y'know, except that even if they are good in this area like you think, they can absolutely fuck you in so many other regards?
72. This is spot on +++. Retake the classrooms and stop blaming teachers for behavioural problems.
73. Yep fuck Labor the way they completely locked the gates, only other state that was worse was that other labor fucker in WA.
74. I don't think so as the last state election was right after some lockdowns and the NO DANCING. I expected a blue sea that election and was gobsmacked.
75. I do not know why any politician would chase the Olympics, it must be an ego trip for them and it just shows how stupid they are to think it will be their legacy or that they will still be in power to open the Olympics. Even if it was a good idea for the long term future, the short term pain (during their 4 year term) kills business and employment in the property areas that need to be developed for stadiums, creates business opportunities and profits for overseas owned entities and the people they bring in. Increases the price of housing due to market speculators and that is the real legacy. Who benefits from that? The glory of being the leader during the Olympic games goes to their successors or the other side of politics being in power by the time the Olympics games arrive.
76. Again we have recent historical evidence that switching to LNP to punish labour is worse. And there is no evidence that they will be better this time.
77. Why would you HATE people being clear in their values and beliefs? Left and right actually means something - it's not just a sports team. If you are fundamentally a compassionate person who believes in social justice, equitable division of resources and opportunities - then you are left wing and therefore will always vote left. It doesn't make sense that somebody's core values completely invert every four years.
78. conservatives when their quality of life worsens after voting for a party that wanted to make it worse https://preview.redd.it/7bfpneq0ycxd1.jpeg?width=797&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21c80be2401b8ee3237fc399a8dc95eda4872e50
79. As someone who has worked in labs, that would have happened regardless of who was in Government. Steven Miles is not standing there reviewing laboratory testing standards.
80. > I like some policies on both sides What LNP policies do you like?
81. You mean once the media stops using outlying cases to stir up the community. I wish people would actually look at what actually works and understand that simplistic solutions don‚Äôt solve complex problems. No matter how many times criminologists explain that harsher punishments don‚Äôt reduce crime rates,people still embrace this simplistic, disproven and expensive solution. Sadly people seem more focussed on punishing ‚Äú bad people‚Äù than actually reducing crime. They are so conditioned to see genuine solutions as being ‚Äú soft on crime. Yet time and time again we see the kind of reactionary, simplistic solutions that people embrace when they feel scared and powerless, simply create more isolated, angry, disenfranchised people who take out their rage on society.
82. Except it means kids are fed. Arguably one of the best uses of gov money there is tbh. A startlingly large number of kids go to school with no food, which given how rich a society we are should never happen.
83. misguided brother the policy was prep to grade 6, and ABS census data says there is about 329,311 children in QLD in that age range, per year to feed each child it was estimated at $1,600, that's a little over 500mil a year. Where the hell did you get 2b+ a year ? it's really too bad they didn't feed you during that instrumental time of mental development.
84. It‚Äôs less ‚Äúwasted‚Äù than plenty of things the government spends money on. I for instance would rather spend money on feeding kids than building sports stadiums or aspects of defense spending. I don‚Äôt even have kids and can absolutely understand the powerful benefit that it would have across wild at all levels. It‚Äôs the sort of spending that is absolutely up flowing. It‚Äôs money going to Australian farmers and food produces, and into schools and school communities and has such a massive positive benefit across all levels of the state. Add to that all the saved household labour and stress reduction for every working family. All of which flows into increased productivity. Better education. Happier, healthier communities.
85. ? Katter himself went on record yesterday saying he will put it to parliament
86. You must be male. 4 years being denied access to healthcare is a bit of a big deal to those of us whose lives are at risk. Glad you‚Äôve got the luxury of not being affected. Must be nice to be a human being!
87. I think the inability of either party to really tackle domestic violence is a long-standing issue in Australia. How is the LNP going to address youth crime with harsher penalties if we haven‚Äôt been able to address violent crime and DV assaults by adult offenders with existing penalties.
88. Men are murdering us daily in DV cases and people are more concerned about the steadily declining numbers of opportunistic teenagers ‚Äúbreaking in‚Äù to houses with no fences or gates or even locked doors‚Ä¶ Awesome, yeah cool. The beaten up Ford Territories of Pallara definitely have more value than our lives. Gotta protect that shit, but let‚Äôs force women to carry pregnancies for men who‚Äôre killing us.
89. The problem is that prisons Australia wide are overcrowded and no government has a solution to that problem. There aren't enough screws to guard the places we already have, corrections is an absolute dogshit career choice, and a quick Google search confirms it's the same in Queensland. Part of the reason why so many criminals are just let back out on the street is there is absolutely nowhere to put them in the system. The LNP won't fix this.
90. Yet they have more support for things that actually address the cause of crime and lower it? Ultimate power for sentences really sits with judges anyhow. It's also been proven time and time again that harsh reactionary "solutions" like tougher sentences don't improve crime stats, they can even make it worse as you disenfranchise more people.
91. So you're just going to ignore the overwhelming amount of evidence that shows being "tough on crime", does literally nothing to actually reduce crime or do anything at all to deter it?
92. Yes, dump all the kids in adult prisons and create future criminal for the future. Then what?
93. Understandable but also sad. There's not a lot that the state government could have done about those issues. The Miles government was actually doing way more on that front than LNP with all the benefits from the coal royalties bringing in 50c fares, $1k off energy bills, school lunches and more.
94. What do the LNP build except roads? I mean, roads are nice, but they are allergic to doing anything else except selling everything that isn't nailed down to the private sector.
95. The privatisation of state assets has largely been a disaster for this country, why would state controlled assets be a bad thing? All the private sector has done for me in my life when it comes to most services is price gouge and fuck me.
