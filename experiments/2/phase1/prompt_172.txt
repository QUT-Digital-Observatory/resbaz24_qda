Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Not sure what you want? If the LNP do what they said they'd do? It's going to be very good for us all. Reddit & this sub are very "young labour" If you support the LNP in here you are abused & trashed. So don't expect to get answers from LNP voters. Trust in your fellow Queenslanders. People have exercised their democratic right. If you believe in democracy? You accept the will of the people and move on. That's how democracy works. If you refuse to accept it and carry on? You're no better than Trump and his cult of supporters. Think about it. Tomorrow is a new day
2. Honestly after Newman, the lnp would be fully aware if they want to stay in they have to be careful on what they do. Say they do cut all these jobs and criminalize abortions... Do you know how easy it is then for labor to get back in ? Change can be good, but we the people need to keep them honest and keep them to their word.
3. All is not lost. Channelling Trump, the mincing chihuahua SMiles has won a historic victory and not conceded graciously. I repeat he has NOT conceded.
4. Our massive state debt might actually stop growing for a change?
5. It will be a short honeymoon once Blejie fires up to his usual self as he did last time LNP were in power. Given his performance and cunt attitude toward Cameron Dick for that debate Blejie refused to show up to, and the fact Amanda Stoker is in QLD parliament, it will indeed be a one-term government. The writing is on the wall.
6. " I’m feeling down and could do with some positives to look towards. " Politics on both sides but mainly on the left use scare tactics instead of Policies . Many of the younger generation seem totally vulnerable to these scare campaigns and swallow them hook line and sinker. Of course there will be some change but grow up please . Get on with your life . The sun will still rise tomorrow,
7. The reality is that there are two States of Qld - Brisbane ... and the rest.
8. I think we have significant sway if we live in Brisbane, regardless of who your MP is. It’s clear that Brisbane wants progressive politics so we can keep demanding the new government gives us that. And we can kick up a stink if they don’t.
9. Potentially good news if you work in mining, I guess? That's about the only consolation prize for me.
10. All of the above and also let’s see what they do with the Brisbane Olympics.
11. The two major parties are essentially the same. I wouldn’t panic.
12. The dread of the boogieman is wildly exaggerated and largely akin to group self brain washing. It will be pretty mild and none of the doomsday stuff people are saying will eventuate. Some Ef up will eventuate though and people will wail and screech that they were right (even though it will be nothing like all the ‘end is nigh’ BS this subreddit has been spewing over the last 24hrs). The the pendulum will swing back and we’ll be back to another decade or so of ALP after 1 or 2 terms.
13. Nothing much will happen only the smaller things will change like the 50c public transport but even then I doubt it
14. For me personally I make more money from the LNP and the ALP. When the LNP are in office nobody in the public service gives a fuck about the budget and I simply rip them off. And people just pay.
15. I'm not in Queensland, but one positive is the LNP in QLD cant do any worse than Federal Labor. :)
16. Look, end of the day, theres no massive diference between either party. People will swear nlack and blue one does this or the other does that...Its all brainwashing bullshit. End of the day the idiots alll get together and vote on what they want/dont want. In every other smart state theres an upper house to perform checks and balances on their votes. Qld doesnt have this, thats why we have so many bullshit laws that wouldnt fly in other states. I mean it could benifit things by sometimes speeding change along, but you have to ask yourself, how many multi billion dollar mistakes could have been prevented if we had an upper house. Single chamber legislative goverment... Queeeennnn sssslllANnnndddd diiiiirrrrrrr....droollll.
17. There are no positives. When people show you who they are believe them. Queenslanders deserve every bit of societal destruction coming their way because that is what they voted for.
18. Wow nice one dumb qlders we are fucked now ..... LNP is in power, start finding a new job....... Remindme!in 1 year
19. We'll all be able to leave our houses unlocked and the doors/windows wide open, keys in our cars and not need to lock them when shopping.
20. They probably won’t get a majority so if you are a rural Queenslander Katter will probably get the balance of power which means better infrastructure for rural Queensland. Ignore the crazy abortion stuff no one will waste their time on trying to pass that.
21. As an LNP supporter I ask you this… how old were you when Liberals were in? If you don’t remember then don’t get caught up in the reddit propaganda
22. What a sore lose, he wouldn't even concede defeat graciously. Time to sack him as ALP leader.
23. The way you are feeling is the way I feel everytime a Labor government wins state or federally. How I rationalise it is:- Ok, I'm in the minority with my views. Let's see how this lot go with implementing their policies. (Sometimes I lament on the blatant lies in a campaign that are run as it confuses the issues even more but this isn't a useful emotion.) I always wish them well in mind and hope they can implement what it is they want to do as they are just people standing up for what they believe in and theyve earnt their spot and shot at controlling the big game. I then also reset my judgement meter. I put it in the centre and then I just start again. On the difficult losses to accept I just remind myself that there's no way I'd seek or so that job so I'm thankful there are people amongst us willing to play that extremely unattractive game. That's how I deal with day 1 of the other side winning. And being a Qlder, I've been there many times. 😁
24. I am also extremely disappointed, Crisafulli ran a horrible campaign and committed to little while stating “that’s not the plan”. However this is their budget planning [here](https://amp.abc.net.au/article/104510856) stating that they want to upskill and ensure that their public service workers are capable and to cut jobs from consultancy companies. This has put my mind at ease a little. Edit: This is a direct quote “The LNP has vowed to rein in almost $6.8 billion in spending on consultants if it wins government, flagging it would instead develop public servants’ skills and saying it wants pay packages to be “competitive” with those of private organisations such as KPMG”. I think putting focus into public sector workers and ensuring that the cream of the crop won’t run off to private is a very good idea. Let’s hope they go through with it.
25. My only positive thought is 'I'm moving states'. Queensland got what it deserved.
26. Told myself I'd help people if Labor won like charities and stuff. Told myself I'd finally give into greed and use policies to help me get rich by ripping off people younger than me and paying them as little as I can using multi-year outdated acts and awards if Lnp won. Sorry. I didn't vote for this outcome. All of you did.rhe good news is, I have juuuuuuust enough capital to get the gravy train rolling. Now excuse me whole I go research just exactly how little I can get away with paying my future employees. Lnp policies enable people like this and I got sick of being mad at them so. Switching from Labor to Lnp today. Switching from caring about others to 'fck you I got mine' (Not actually fck you for the purpose of this comment, it's just the terminology, and I'm not being salty. I'm genuinely making the switch of beliefs because I'm getting to old to be mad at things all the time)
27. I doubt the abortion laws will be wound back as DC would need to resign on principle.
28. Once they make abortions illegal it might at least help boost the birth rate.
29. Keeping mining royalties would be nice though. Hopefully they don't privatise and sell off more assets. Build all the casinos that idiot Campbell was trying to do.
30. Thank you. I needed that reminder today. I’m extremely disappointed we won’t get our big wet battery though.
31. Let's see how dumb they are to try and roll this back. Surely they're not that stupid, but let's see.
32. It’ll go. Once they do in with the mining tax, there’ll be no money to fund it and they sure won’t make any effort to fund it another way.
33. yeah Miles has definitely shifted the conversation on these things
34. This is a city issue and I think labor just realised that Brisbane red and the rest of the state blue means they can’t look after city dwellers and neglect rural and still win an election. Have a look at the election map and realise that Brisbane city and outliers are the only labor seats.
35. Wait...what? The last couple months were the ONLY positives from the last term....buying votes... for an election.
36. They will need to as the LNP are looking to save money.
37. Yeah, the unionists, with much reduced chances of joining the Party in the near future, will be busy.
38. This statement doesn't make sense does it? Wouldn't they have more power for change with their so called mates in?
39. Also on the teachers front, while free lunches were probably a net good, they would likely be hell for schools to administer. At least until the system settled done and become entrenched.
40. Will they though ? Royalties are the exact same as they were before Labor raised them for high coal prices because the coal price has dropped so much, back to royalties being back at their base rate.
41. Mate, give it 6 months and 50 cent fares gone. Just ask your doctor to sign off on the form for free travel because you forget to tap on and off. Free to apply.
42. I really hope they only last one term, but we all know how much damage the LNP can do in one term…
43. Right into the ground. Cost of living crisis. Mental health crisis. Housing crisis.... The list goes on. Great job ALP...i don't understand why you got your ass kicked in the election.
44. At least they’ll get a free sando behind bars I suppose.
45. And at least woman can be forced into producing kids into this system as well.
46. I would encourage those who are able, to talk to your P&C and school tuckshops and see if you are able to help a hungry kid in need sometimes. Sucks we have to do it instead of government…. But we can do little bits to help.
47. What report is this food insecurity based off, is it really that much of a concern?
48. I think I lasted seven days under the Newman government.
49. Yeah my partner started in payroll at qld health 3 months ago. I'm worried for her job.
50. I interviewed for a job just prior to the Newman slashing. We were told that job was going to be absorbed into the floor staff they needed to cut. It sucked because I wanted the job but necessary to try keep as many nurses on the floor as possible. Still ended up having to drop one nurse from each shift. I feel for nursing and midwifery students in their final year. There won't be the same number of grad positions now despite the desperate need for both.
51. Yes have to say Miles did seem to actually care really, gutted.
52. That was a long time ago. Things are far more costly and hard now than ever before. A lot of us won’t survive.
53. Not with the current cost of living and having to already skip meals :(
54. Hopefully the rest of the boomer population that voted lnp will be dead by the next election.... with all the cuts that will be coming to the public health sector
55. How much better did house prices get while ALP were in office? And the environment?
56. That's the funny thing isn't it? QLD just voted for change. QLD housing became the most unaffordable it has ever been, and by a large margin, while ALP was at the helm? Are you familiar with Stockholm syndrome?
57. If QLDers cared about others they wouldn't have voted against school lunches and abortions
58. Except for the hundreds and thousands of southerners who migrated here and priced a lot of good quality Queenslanders out of their home towns, and have contributed to this dog shit outcome of a vote…. If you’re in trouble on the side of the road they’ll run you right the fuck over.
59. i expect the opposite, fewer houses built, more expensive homes.
60. Will it though? This is one of their vaguest plans. Their plan is to spend 100 days forming a plan, except with no extra money, no new stadium, and not upgrading QSAC. So that leaves.... Back to rebuilding the gabba. The unpopularity of this being the cause of the mess. I think they should have just bit the extra cost and built the Vic Park stadium. Hopefully the libs agree, and quickly. It is a mess they need to fix and I wish them the best in solving it.
61. I've gotten fucked up really badly in terms of drunk at the moment, and I probably will try to just sleep in sunday. I'm honestly thinking of trying to move to shit nowhere victoria at this point. Anywhere out of Queensland really. I hope you get through this mate. If you need to talk, I'm happy to chat.
62. Depends what they do about 50c fares. Half of these commenters think they'll be here till the heat death of the universe and half think they'll be gone by Monday. That will have a very real impact on my literal day to day life.
63. While I'm very sad about the outcome, if the LNP have any sense, you might be right. It's a big if, but hey, stranger things have happened.
64. LNP can’t help themselves. It’s gonna be a shit show. If the issues weren’t so serious I’d be eating popcorn and enjoying it.
65. Watch this comment age like milk as the pre-poll votes keep coming in.
66. Ir might be that it's actually very hard to defend LNP positions without media running interference.
67. It has made for a remarkable echo chamber, hasn't it! One that after tonight is demonstrably well out of touch with the mainstream, too.
68. They want you to point towards some achievable policies. I'm reading the LNP policy document right now and they're promising a lot of vague and unrealistic things. It mentions a bunch of stuff that doesn't exist either. Like patient and renters tax...the "renters tax" never made it into law and GPs are exempt from the payroll tax >.> They make a lot of promises to do work without any concrete plans or identifiable goals.
69. I love coal mining too! We should keep selling all our natural resources and get nothing for them!
70. It's a big difference if they repeal the coal royalties like they plan to. That's billions that goes to state they'll either need to cut or raise elsewhere. That's not very good at all.
71. Trust in them because they simply wanted something different? Not that we have any problems but they are sick of the same party in power so they want a change simply for the sake of it? And what has LNP said it’ll do? Tackle youth crime. Even if they actually do that and pull it off, that’s one thing. That’s all their campaign has been about.
72. At least the kids will get free lunch in prison. And woman's rights going backwards is always a good sign...
73. Federal LNP will disavow Qld like always, unless their Republican advisors think it's a winner.
74. I will be messaging you in 1 year on [**2025-10-26 20:22:28 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2025-10-26%2020:22:28%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/queensland/comments/1gck577/honest_thoughts_on_positives_for_someone/ltwkgva/?context=3) [**CLICK THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fqueensland%2Fcomments%2F1gck577%2Fhonest_thoughts_on_positives_for_someone%2Fltwkgva%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202025-10-26%2020%3A22%3A28%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam. ^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%201gck577) ***** |[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)| |-|-|-|-|
75. Crime is lower now than it ever was under LNP...
76. You are right! If we all do that, overall victim numbers will increase and LNP will resign in 4 years. I love your thinking, very strategic.
77. What makes you think anything will actually change? Just because that’s literally the only thing they were campaigning about, doesn’t mean they will actually do it.
78. I mean, if you’re doing that anyway you deserve to be broken into
79. both my frontline parents losing their jobs under Campbell when I was young isn’t reddit propaganda
80. I was there. I remember extremely well. And I see the damage that is going to be done over the next 4 years
81. Last LNP, crime was high, the economy was desperately worse off, public assets were gutted or sold off, the public health system was stripped bare which made it one of the worst in the country, Newman fed projects into personal coffers, job rate fell on it's face, property prices floundered horribly. But no you keep believing your own propaganda instead, go right ahead.
82. Who needs propaganda when you can actually just look at archives and the records showing everything LNP have done in the past and their actual performance at governance? For someone continuously spouting the inane things you do, you certainly never stopped to consider you've drank the kool-aid of your 'team' and their own propaganda. You're just being the right wing flavour of everything you level at your left wing opposition.
83. I was in my first year as a student nurse when the last LNP was elected. Watched as many entire departments of hospitals were permanently closed or repurposed because “we just send them to the major hospital” Health services like assisted dying and hospital in the home services that didn’t exist last time are going to be slashed because they cost a lot of man hours to process and don’t fit the slogan. Last time LNP was in power abortion was a criminal act. If you think his promise of it’s not going to be changed holds any water remember the kata party has 3 seats. 3 seats the LNP might need to form government.
84. Old enough to be around for Newman but not Joh, and i remember the Rim Carmody affair and such so it's not all propaganda. But we did just have a very disappointing decade of liberals in federal that everyone should remember. It's difficult to think of any positive policies they willingly implemented over that decade, and it'll certainly go down as a list decade for productivity and climate change.
85. "develop public servants' skills" is just code for making fewer people do more work.
86. As a Labor voter, I am choosing hope as well. Nothing is going to change the fact that a new government has been decided. But I am going to just stay hopeful that despite that, this will stay a state that I love and be proud to be a part of, and that I continue to enjoy my time hanging around the people of this state regardless of there preference in party, as has been the case since before the election.
87. Criminals flock to the LNP like flies to a turd. They always give their supporters ways to launder their money. So, more casinos are on the way.
88. I'm really hoping they don't reduce ambulance ramping by privatising QAS. That would mean less people calling for ambulances because you gotta pay for it, but it would also mean more people die or are financially encumbered because of chronic conditions.
89. Already got my free travel access pass in preparation for goodbye 50 cent fares.
90. The thing is "let's how dumb they are" is a test of US, not them. They went on record to repeal mining regulation, iffy about abortion and have a history of privatising good public projects, haven't released their budget or costings and they STILL got in. How dumb are WE?
91. Surely not favourable in the regions as they don’t benefit?
92. The real positives are for business. Environment and humanity is dead, but businesspeople will get massive gains.
93. Thank good, you don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone
94. The QTU purposefully hasn’t striked since Newman was in to make Labor look good. On the other hand the Labor government has continually screwed teachers over the same time. For example despite there being a massive teacher shortage, there has not been pay increase that has outpaced inflation over that time period. During covid labor even stopped teachers from getting any incremental increase for 12 months, effectively making pay go backwards. Every time this happened the QTU just rolled over and agreed since all their friends are in Labor and the top Union members all want to become Labor politicians in the future.
95. You would think so, but take the main union for the federal public service as an example, the CPSU. Multiple people from union leadership have made the hop into a Labor political career, leveraging their union position. (Looking at you, Finance Minister Katy Gallagher.) As a result, union officials always act with an eye to their future political career, and go soft on any industrial action, when they negotiate with Labor governments. And the membership gets dudded. That's how we ended up this year with an Enterprise Agreement that barely offered parity with inflation, and the Union recommended that to staff as the "best possible offer on the table." I'm guessing the Teachers Union is similar.
96. Yeah, cafeateria service, *something no one has ever done before*, apparently too hard, let the children continue to starve.
97. Why would this be hard for the school to administer? They already do provide lunches, but for financial exchange instead. Every school has a tuckshop where kids can buy foods. They'd literally just not take money for 'marked' foods before school starts. Kids would stand in line, and ask for one of those foods - cereal or some fruit.
98. I’ve worked as a police officer and I am now a teacher. Our watch houses are fed by local businesses who have a contract to cover the catering on a specific day. Local businesses would have been able to supply say sandwiches on a Monday (and another business has a contract for Tuesdays etc) to help the tuckshop with the increased demand. The government has handled more complex tasks than catering. It could have been done. I now work as a teacher in a state primary school. I have about 6 children in my class who have low attendance. I guarantee those parents would be more motivated to send those kids to school if they are being fed. It saves the family money which is especially important in a cost of living crisis. If we can get them to school, we can teach them. Or we can fix their mental health. Hey it might even prevent them getting in to crime at a later stage if they are educated and they get access to the programs that our state schools run on social skills or zones of regulation. It’s a good policy to feed children. It’s a good policy to encourage public transport. The society I want to live in needs to look after people and provide equality for all. I’ve seen first hand how hard some children have it (by policing and now teaching) and it’s in theirs and everyone’s interest to build them up. It worries me that people cast their votes based solely on their interests (or lack of proper education in to what exactly they are voting for) and not thinking of others in our society.
99. sorry you didn't get a bite last time champ. Good to see you running it back
100. We're in a third consecutive surplus, have the best economic performance in the country, the biggest expansion of private renewable investment and related job growth (in addition to our public works), the cheapest power with our coal royalty fun-bucks, consistently dropping crime rates, and the cheap public transport has already shown to invigorate the local economy.
101. The YMCA Schools’ Breakfast Program began in September 2006 with the support of the Clem Jones Group and Foodbank Queensland. The program started at five state schools in the heart of Logan, deemed by Education Queensland as ‘most in need’ of a breakfast program. https://ymcaqueensland.org.au/services/schools-breakfast-program https://www.foodbank.org.au/hungry-queensland-children/?state=nsw-act https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-09/food-insecurity-children-outreach-programs-free-lunches-school/104318308 This isn't a new thing but when you only give a fuck about what you can get you miss the forest for the trees
102. For anyone who isn’t a self-serving asshole, yes it’s that much of a concern.
