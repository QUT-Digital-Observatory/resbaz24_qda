Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. They sure have, just like the current head of the RBA wants the unemployment rate to go up. Its amazing how leaders can say these words and not think that the numbers are people, and those people start counting numbers, ie how much short they will be on their mortgage, rent, food or bills.
2. If that's your take, then nothing I can say will change your mind. Having concerns and fears is totally fair, but I dont think people should be so venomous and hateful towards people who voted the opposite to them.
3. Mustn’t live in Queensland then, because otherwise, he is your premier, and there’s nothing you can say for another 4 years to change it
4. Thank-you! Someone who understands our reliance on sitting governments agreement with legislation to keep our basic rights. Even our freedoms of expression.
5. Nice, your leaving frees up a house in the market too. Win win. Thanks for your service
6. >The country is spiralling down the gurgler with the 2 party preferred system. Well, you'll like that LNP is going to get rid of it.
7. Queensland doesn't flip flop. It's been labor for decades with occasionally letting LNP get a single turn they royally stuff it up, every time.
8. Yep, in 2012, I had a government job in regional Queensland. Now, this is only my experience (it doesn't make it right or wrong), but in the field I was working in, a large number of senior management were made redundant. Anecdotally, those roles that were made redunant were absolutely bureaucratic bloat and needed to be culled. I totally concede that this was just my personal experience, and I understand yours or others may have been different. So politely, yes, I was around last time the LNP was in government.
9. People being worried about losing their jobs is a legitimate concern due to the history of the LNP gutting services.
10. You are right, regionals dont care about 50 cent fares. But they do care about jobs and affordability, and most importantly not defunding government services then centralising them down in SEQ like LNP did last time.
11. The reason it changed is because some thought we apparently needed the change yet there was nothing wrong before. It’s the classic “they’ve been in too long” stigma and most pre voted based on that to shortly realise what they did and I’d say a lot have not realised until it’s too late. And a lot are upset because it took David being elected to actually announce his plan where ALP announced theirs immediately but was buried in the Queensland Liberal Medias branding of “Adult time Adult crime” so we only saw Liberal crap being washed over our screens.
12. You’re correct. It was crazy to see this subreddit and r/brisbane react so quickly when the LNP won and go on to call the people of QLD idiots…
13. Please tell me what planet you are living on because that place sounds great.
14. I try to keep my personal political bias this round neutral only because i am personally a swing voter, but jesus, people are predicting the end of days. Being confined to political idealogy is no different from being obsessed with a football team, in my opinion. This tribalism is totally unnecessary.
15. Way to say you have no understanding of the situation.
16. Have you even been to South Africa? Stop overexaggerating and touch grass.
17. This. I’ve had friends use the VAD laws and it gave them a dignified end to their pain. I am not a ‘professional protester’ by any stretch of the imagination, but I will campaign hard against any attempt to roll those laws back.
18. My mother passed from cancer just before VAD became available but towards the end of her life it became something she focused on supporting, despite knowing she would pass before it took effect - writing to MPs, attending town hall type things. Our local member told her story as part of his conscience vote. I was already a supporter of it, but now ensuring it stays in means a lot more to me than it previously did, and I will absolutely take it personally if they go after VAD laws.
19. I don't have a particularly high opinion of France, but I immensely respect their tradition of whenever the government fucks over the people the people go "Fuck it, Paris burns tonight." We should get used to doing that.
20. And that will be the death knell for a lot of charities. The funding taps have been turned off federally since the Morrison government took power in 2018. There was a lot of hope that Labor government would ease the situation, but the purse strings are still tightly closed. As it stands, a few preferred charities get all the money and most of them are scrambling to become fully self-funded.
21. They'll leave victim support services alone hopefully. And child protection and corrections you would think. Everyone on a temporary contract should be very worried though
22. Sure, but there are consequences when a tonne of jobs get slashed and there’s a rapid influx of people all competing for the same sort of work at the same time. There’s also longer term consequences when the government still “needs” those workers, but just can’t afford them now, so in a few years when they want them again they’ve diluted that pool of works because they’ve been forced to leave the industry or they no longer trust the government as an employer. But I mean you’d probably just say they aren’t entitled to welfare either because it’s not your wife, your job and therefore not your problem. Yet again demonstrating that classic short sighted “fuck you I got mine” attitude.
23. Easily among the dumbest shit I've read. Public teat? You're referring to paying people to perform a service for the state right?
24. I think you're vastly underestimating the ignorance of the LNP.
25. Yeah they’ve got like a one or two seat majority? If they piss of Brisbane they’re gone. So I imagine that’ll be a moderating effect
26. Wasn’t the joke back then “What’s the difference between the QLD Labor party and a Tarago? The Tarago has more seats” At least they have a reasonably sized opposition this time.
27. It’s actually pretty important to show the electorate vigorously disapproves of something and are willing to organise against it. One of a government’s worst enemies is an electorate willing to organise It’s much, much better for “the conversation” if they are too shit scared to ever even allow the topic to be tabled. The best outcome is if Katter never even puts a private members bill forward, and every government knows for the next 10 years or more not to touch this topic with a ten foot pole.
28. there doesn't need to be though. a lot of the really fucked things the newman government did were rammed through late at night with no warning. we may well hear about it for the first time once it's done
29. Its not "hysteria" when its a known platform. Take it from an American, don't wait till legislation is being drafted. Complacency is a large part of what helped kill abortion access in the USA.
30. There are already known members of the incoming government who want abortion criminalised. It’s not ‘hysteria’ when the threat to women’s bodily autonomy is credible. These people need to never get to the point of tabling legislation
31. The idea is to ensure that there won't be any such legislation. That said I'm pretty sure LNP wouldn't care because they'd assume the protestors against repealing abortion rights would vote Labor regardless.
32. I half agree, half disagree - the idea is to keep it fresh in their minds that they shouldn't mess with abortion laws now or later. But you're also right, they've shown no indication they will, only Katter has.
33. Katter said he wants to bring the bill. the LNP said they would "conscience vote" the bill. The bills coming.
34. the state weren't in financial trouble then and aren't now. they actually had net assets (think your house being worth more than your mortgage). the public service cuts were pure ideology, planned long in advance and lied about fast forward to now, they've been slimy throughout the campaign. given the history and the individuals involved they deserve the scepticism
35. Persons is inclusive. If you do not like that, that's ok.
36. No, I'm saying that gutting environment regulations will allow irresponsible farms to dump as much as they like into the catchments resulting in chemical runoff to the reef
37. If a judge says this kid is going to detention ***nobody*** is going to be giving 'permission'. Are you really that dense?
38. You severely underestimate white rich Christian women’s ability to punch down.
39. It's not your opinion I take issue with, it's your condescending tone. I don't have to know you to pick that up.
40. Track record of a party the last time they were in government, and the man in charge of that party now helped enact those policies then.
41. https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/03/queensland-brings-back-civil-unions-for-same-sex-couples Here's an article from 2015, when Labor reinstated civil unions after the LNP axed them in 2012. You can read the bill itself - "Civil Partnerships and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2012" https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/bill.first.exp/bill-2012-1642/lh
42. I mean, you can probably find it literally anywhere - before the 2012 election Labor granted same-sex couples civil union rights. As soon as Newman got in he abolished them in an act of spite.
43. Whether you like Crikey or not doesn’t change the facts 🤷‍♀️
44. A child will not be given a caution for a serious crime like rape in QLD. This is because rape is considered a 'serious offence'. There is no 'they must be dealt with by way of caution first' lol. How you even think that's occuring is crazy! You seem to be misunderstanding "Last resort" - It does not mean everything else must happen first. It means it must be considered at the very least. If the appropriate sentence is imprisonment, then detention will be the sentence. "Section 208 Detention must be only appropriate sentence A court may make a detention order against a child only if the court, after— (a) considering all other available sentences; and (b) taking into account the desirability of not holding a child in detention; is satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate in the circumstances of the case." So, a caution would not be considered an appropriate sentence for rape... detention would be. Also, a child accused of murder or manslaughter would still be dealt with under the Youth Justice Act. The Youth Justice Act still allows for life sentences for minors - Section 176. Either someones been feeding you a load of shit, or you genuinely just never read the act yourself. Which is fine and reasonable, but you just might want to read up on it first - All acts are publicly available - before you have a comment. We can all accidentally spread misinformation, so we shoud all try our best to double check what we read online is legit.
45. So you have comprehension & logic problems? Who's government did that happen under? Being in a reset camp is what will stress them out & destroy their lives. We as a community should be stressed about how we'll be damaging kids for life en masse & vomiting them back into the community much worse people. Children don't wake up one morning & decide they'll roam the streets being chaos demons. Their hopelessness isn't going to go away. Their brains aren't developed enough to understand consequences, so when they're escaping their troubled homes they're not thinking "gee, I should turn my life around". It takes a village to raise kids & people like you turn the village into something out of a horror movie. Everywhere the kid goes, everyone is trying to harm them.
46. Hey Histrionic Harry. These reset camps are going to be filled with kids who miss school for one day. It's not a gotcha to name some outliers (or make them up) as if that represents the whole of the problem.
47. This flippant comments tells me you don't understand even the first thing about why children, who's brains aren't fully developed & can't fathom consequences, are acting out. Yes of course the best thing would be if all kids were angels, & where does that start? So the answer to any problem is the fix the root of thr problem, not chuck grenades at the end result.
48. We have all these misconceptions, too much US tv i guess. But it is crazy to realise we are still very much ' convicts ' at the beck n call of an aristocratic democracy.,. Most( esp the LNP) who hve no real interest in the plight of the 'commoners' Our 'constitution ' is written from the top down how we are to be governed and controlled. Unlike the US constitution which written from the bottom up. Rights and privileges for l to which the government is SUPPOSED to bide by. But that of course has fallen mostly to the wayside with major corporations having bought and paid for their senators etc. Here a politician cost a few thousand in ' donations ' with a juicy position worth much more after politics. Inthe US it is hundreds of thousands.!
49. I can't answer that for anyone else, but NOT voting for the big two is a start. Overhauling the system is the stretch goal.
50. When I critique the last LNP government I don't just refer to job losses (which were both extensive and excessive) but also everything else. Hospitals and schools shit down, just in my LGA we had a hospital and 2 schools shut under him. The significant cuts to community support services, particularly mental health. The draconian anti crime laws that just made the situation worse. To this day Campbell Newman refuses to acknowledge that he did anything wrong and who was standing next to him the entire time? Our current LNP leader. Before that we had the stellar experience of good old Joh. Conservatives in QLD have never changed the play book and just expect people to forget and unfortunately people do.
51. Well clearly Queenslanders did not think the ALP was doing a good job about those things, so brought in the LNP
52. At least calling them 'idiots' is (slightly) nicer than the words Mrs Crisafulli uses to describe the local constituents......
53. yeah dont even try to reason with this sub. i voted labor, but im not gonna kick and scream like a spoiled child because a democratic process didnt go my way.
54. How so? I know someone who was murdered and their killer was out in two years
55. I lived and worked in Cairns, Townsville and Cape York. I think you need to get out of your urban bubble.
56. I'm heartened to hear that there are people like you who are motivated to fight to have those laws to stay, to maintain the rights that took so many people decades to fight for, and we've only just gotten! This government getting in does scare me. I did see that the LNP got in, and I did get scared. Knowing the potential they have to destroy so much of what's just been achieved and took so long to build across so many sectors, and that they've been peacocking about a few of those things already is frightening. I think the fact that so many people are willing to just sit back and cruise through it speaks to the helplessness and hopelessness so many Australians feel. We're stuck with this government so what can we do? We have to start protesting more of course, but first we have to become more like other countries and become more active in our communities. Volunteer with organisations who need bodies on the ground, pushing to make the changes or keep the changes we need to make Australia a better, kinder, safer place for everyone.
57. I agree. There's a lot of talk from many countries, not just ours, about why Australians just let our government do whatever they want and we never protest or riot. The government's made it as illegal as they can without going full fascist for one, but I've really started to question that myself. I wonder if it's that we're still a country that trusts the government, or we're now part murdoch zombies, part socially anxious useless "i can't go outside" zombies? like, I don't know. Why aren't we protesting more? We definitely are getting out there for climate change and things, but it's not in Paris is burning numbers and it's not for long lol. We don't seem to really have the courage of our convictions. Maybe the cost of living is too high. We can protest for two hours one day a week but then we have to work because rent is 75% of our income and we can't afford time off lol. I dunno.
58. Yes riots and looting and burning the place down will absolutely help you
59. Let’s play spot the Marxist Doomsday Cultist. Like the OP inferrs, Chill daddy.
60. \>Sure, but there are consequences when a tonne of jobs get slashed and there’s a rapid influx of people all competing for the same sort of work at the same time. Yeah, the job market gets more competitive for employees. The government then has much more leverage to hire employees on contract at ACTUAL market rates. The taxpayer benefits and we get decrepit, moribund public servant wage bill permanently lowered and off the books. \>There’s also longer term consequences when the government still “needs” those workers, but just can’t afford them now, so in a few years when they want them again they’ve diluted that pool of works because they’ve been forced to leave the industry or they no longer trust the government as an employer. Why would we not be able to afford them lmfao, you really need to reexamine your priors. You cannot help but make assumptions based on zero evidence. \>But I mean you’d probably just say they aren’t entitled to welfare either because it’s not your wife, your job and therefore not your problem. Yet again demonstrating that classic short sighted “fuck you I got mine” attitude. I have skills that are in demand in the private sector, of course I resent my tax dollars going towards funding mickey mouse jobs in the do-nothing email factory. If the only thing keeping you from unemployment is a treasury payslip then you are worthless.
61. Yeah it's wild to me to think some folks are worries being too prepared for an eventuality could be a negative.
62. I assume we’d also be against something like (for example) lifting all safety standards for food product manufacturers, but we’d look pretty silly organising a rally against it if no one is proposing such a move, right? Preemptive rallies and protests make it easy to paint us as hysterical Chicken Littles running around screaming about the sky falling. We know they want to pull some bullshit about abortion rights. Let them show their hand before we smack it down. Otherwise we look like we’re flailing at nothing.
63. Out of interest, were any of those done still affecting us? I feel like there wasn’t anything too long lasting, but happy to be proven wrong
64. So just like labor then? Lol mate get off the pipe and chillout
65. >women’s bodily autonomy Nice euphemism for late term abortions of healthy and viable pregnancies
66. >the protestors against repealing abortion rights would vote Labor regardless. Lol yup, who just lost the election This protest idea is hilarious
67. The state is under a mountain of debt, you've disconnected with reality.
68. Read my first sentence then question who is the dense one.
69. Friend, I can 100% confirm that child offenders can and are given a caution for rape. There are individual circumstances around it, and it’s usually a “consent issue” type rape, but it definitely happens.
70. Do you actually think they will be filled with kids for missing one day of school yes/no? Or are you just spewing hyperbole Love how you imply I have a mental disorder and imply I’ve made up these crimes because you don’t agree with my opinion. Did you know the Nazis and Stalinist communists applied similar tactics to discredit their political opponents?
71. QLD just voted to put in a part that promised to get rid of Full Preferential Voting, making it Optional again. Observe the BCC results to see what that gives you - just LNP.
72. There are no minor parties with even close to the level of responsibility to potentially govern meaning nobody with even a modicum of sense will vote for them if they actually have a chance.
73. Yeah, ok, i understand your position, then whereby the LNP government of the time impacted you personally. The anti crime laws, The VLAD laws in particular I personally liked. I do understand, though these are polarising, which is why every 4 years we get to vote and decide if we want to change or not. From a personal perspective, I can understand why, given your previous experiences in your LGA, why you'd be hesitant. My experiences are the total opposite however. Now, doesn't mean i think you're a bad person or think less of you. It's just that we have different ideologies. I hope others (particularly in this comment section) can be as constructive as you have been.
74. People having legitimate concerns is idiotic? Just so we are clear, being worried about losing your job because that's exactly what happened last time is considered idiotic?
75. Incarceration and criminal behaviour in children is a much bigger issue than crime and time. Time doesn’t fix the situation or prevent further criminal acts.
76. There is "climate change" protests because that's the accepted narrative same with the free Palestine protests all ok because it's all part of the establishments order. Now on the other hand all the protests about COVID restrictions, Vax mandates etc were real battles for our very freedoms yet news media demonised them and most of the country just rolled over like too good little pets they are
77. You're a fan of posting dramatic things that have completely missed the point i see. You've commented multiple times with the same MO. Who said anything about looting? Lol
78. People are more than their economic output. No person is simply worthless. This is probably a fundamental philosophical difference that will never get through to someone like you until you’re unlucky enough to fall through a crack in society and need a helping hand.
79. The Katter party has publicly indicated it will table this. This rally is to remind the LNP not to entertain a conscience vote, as; based on their historical data, the majority of that party would vote for the ban. About the only other thing potentially stopping this is the LNP doing dodgy adverts saying KAP is working with labor in the election run up.
80. > paint us as hysterical Chicken Littles People understand that being proactive on issues like this isn't "hysterical". > no one is proposing such a move The difference being for this issue Katter _has_ proposed such a move, and multiple MPs of the new government have indicated they agree with it, along with the premier himself. > Let them show their hand They already showed it.
81. They've already shown their hand. The nonsensical 'babies born alive' shit is pulled straight from the seppo pro-forced-birther playbook, the whole idea is to chip away at abortion rights via lots of small pieces of legislation that erode access to abortion and scare doctors into refusing them due to the threat of prosecution. And multiple LNP pollies have already said they'll vote against abortion in the conscience vote- we know what they're planning and protesting shows that.
82. So true, you will get down voted as this is the home of the far left leaning clowns, still shedding tears and angry, looking for any cause.. 🥱
83. Independent Public Schools utterly destroyed the transfer system in QLD. It’s never recovered fully.
84. Dunno. Those public servants who supposedly committed suicide aren’t able to answer for themselves. RIP
85. The weed situation has been up the shit since he took down all the bike gangs, we have medicinal... For now
86. I doubt there's much, given it was 3 terms ago a lot of favoura done for developers and other donor mates, cash long pocketed also worth noting abortion wasn't fully legalised then
87. Do you want to post the stats of late term abortions? How they’re overwhelmingly extremely wanted children but are aborted due to deformities in development or to protect the health of the mother? Or nah because you’ll realise how stupid you look?
88. who'd have thought the LNP troll was financially illiterate 🤷
89. Yet QLD As at 30 June 2023, the state's total borrowings were $132.2 billion, and net debt was $24.3 billion [Source](https://www.qao.qld.gov.au/reports-resources/reports-parliament/managing-queenslands-debt-investments-2023) While all other states have higher debt and total borrowings but keep misrepresenting the facts champion, they will never change to fit your misinformation.
90. Sure have. Done my time fruit picking and even sold ag chems for a while. There are dodgy people out there and then the mega farming companies who want to maximise profit off of their land don't care what they do to the waterways. There are a lot of respectable mum&dad farmers out there but they are slowly being bought out by people who have so much money they can drain the Murray-Darling.
