Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Misinformation isn’t some magical thing, it’s very real and pushed by the biggest media outlets in our country. That’s where most normal people get their information and if the information is wrong that can easily mislead a LOT of people. They’re not idiots, they’re being deliberately lied to in order to push a conservative agenda that benefits the rich elites running these companies and the ones funding them.
2. Ask yourself why Sky News puts out the propaganda they do. If you can watch their op-ed rubbish and not see it for the unashamed propaganda it is then I don't know what to tell you. Anyway. They do it because it works. It is full blown lies through omission and obfuscation and this shit is blasted all throughout rural areas. Out at he mines I've worked at the camps have it on full blast in the dining halls. It's a bloody disgrace.
3. They campaigned on ***bulk billing***. LNP voters are too stupid to know the difference between a federal issue and a state issue. Yes, they really have proven themselves to either be too stupid or too lazy to think.
4. Yeah not going to happen until the ABC is reformed to it’s prior glory. Federal LNP stacked that shit so badly when they were in, it’s been on a rough track since.
5. Tbh for me it’s not about popularity or entertainment, and they shouldn’t be aiming for that. Instead building an impartial voice for the regions. The stories discovered will flow into other sources who can make them popular.
6. Anti-abortion legislation (which doesn’t exist) is apparently a massive and imminent issue all of a sudden though…
7. Realising the youth crime in regional electorate is actually a real problem and addressing it.
8. I got punched and robbed in Tokyo, Japan. Does that mean Japan is becoming a dangerous hell on earth?
9. Statistically speaking crime is down. So unless you live off of anecdotes then..
10. They just don't get it, mate. Regional areas are living it. It's fucking real. There's a reason Townsville, Mackay etc all had big swings against the ALP. The ALP has lost Mackay for the first time in 100 years. The crime is out of control. They can quote averaged out stats as much as they like. It's all bullshit.
11. Of course, I'm sure they improved things but in an election, the perception is everything. They kept citing the police stats as if that's going to change what people feel. The LNP's more punitive approach just appeals to people who want the problem to go away.
12. That’s not what is happening on reddit though. Here you have hundreds of comments outright dismissing the youth crime issue as a fabricated fear mongering campaign despite the evidence and reports. These same people are happily propagating the lie that the LNP will sign anti-abortion law into effect. This is an actual active fear campaign based on the non-existent chance that a KAP bill gets anything but laughed at in parliament.
13. An interesting point to be fair. That might be an impact in Mackay and Rockhampton but not in outer Brisbane electorates like Redcliffe and Aspley
14. Katters have been eating into Labor seats in North Queensland since 2013 though.
15. And there it is again - the LNP ultimately won because of "misinformation". Keep flogging that horse, I'm sure it'll come true eventually.
16. lol did you see the ABC coverage of the Voice? It was not exactly what one would call impartial.
17. Anti-abortion legislation (which Katter is bringing forward) is a massive and imminent issues. The LNP refusing to talk about it and state their position is ALSO a massive issue.
18. Which ones? I mean this isn't the lived experience of many people. And look, maybe there is in specific places and electorates. We are used to hearing mor stop the racially coded language of crime year in year out from conservative politicians. When did it stop being racist dog whistling and become a youth crime wave.... It's easy to ignore the conversation frankly when the dog whistle comes out.
19. Personal experience will always be the far more important factor when it comes to voting in regard to these issues, statistics don't mean a lot to someone's who's had their car or house broken into multiple times. It's also worth noting that some regions are experienced higher crimes rates even though the state % is down. And while I feel the puddings been well and truly over egged, friends further north have had a horrible two years and I can see why their area jumped on board.
20. It's not down across individual electorates. And dismissing the legit concerns of people in those electorates that deal with it is part of why Labor lost. But that seems to be typical of most left leaning parties globally. Citizens have X concern, politicians dismiss or ignore and say it's rubbish. Great strategy cotton.
21. Crime not being an issue was the biggest piece of misinformation during this election. Regionally it most definitely is an issue and all people had to do was drill down one more level, from the state level, on the QLD police website and it paints a very different picture. In positive news though, regions of SEQ have never been lower. So much so it hides the problem around the rest of the state.
22. Across the entire state maybe. Not in the regional cities that flipped to the LNP. Not everything is about SEQ. I'm tired of this bullshit about statistics. Try these stats from QLD and the ABC. Facts, not anecdotes. [https://ibb.co/RGKVZPs](https://ibb.co/RGKVZPs)
23. Bro are you living in some regional Qld ? Travel by Train after 6 pm from Central to any place you will see some juveniles hopping on without tickets or making unpleasant sound spilling Drinks from Maccas so railway security has got two massive boxers onto these trains everyday after 6 pm who just hops on to see there are no hitchhikers
24. If they still taught introductory statistics in high school you would know the any statistic can be easily manipulated by simple varying the data input. That's why liars and politicians love stats, you can make them say whatever you want.
25. Yeah, I'd agree with that - I'm in the Northern end, and did a lot of door knocking; I heard that sentiment a fair bit.
26. I see where you’re coming from, but I don’t think those dismissing youth crime are wrong for doing so - nor, do I think abortion is a simple scare campaign (to an extent). The abortion issue was dropped by the KAP as an election stunt; however, the LNP, based on their voting history, do not support it. I can’t blame people for their concern that the party who opposed it would attempt to revert it. That’s a fair view to take. As for youth crime, while the report highlights instances that are important to consider such as reoffending rates and the short comings of the justice system; it highlights that youth crime is trending downwards historically; which is a fair data point to refer to when claiming youth crime isn’t an election issue. Overall, crime and youth crime have improved under the ALP. Both abortion, and youth crime, are wedge topics designed and broadcast to cause division. Each party is guilty of using wedge topics, but let’s be real; that’s a result of decades of Murdoch Media establishing that as a valid tactic globally and here in Australia; can’t blame Labor for pulling those cards now. Both sides have reasons for concern, but I tend to view youth crime as overhyped and abortion recriminalisation as a possibility (same with euthanasia). This election wasn’t about youth crime, or abortion. This election was about multinational mining conglomerates working with the LNP and Murdoch press to remove the current royalty scheme in place. That’s what the discussion should be on; anyone who is more focused on the wedge issues (in my opinion) took the bait (not without reason tbf - I don’t hate those that speak on it).
27. Well the other 47% of the state clearly has a hankering for some shit in their car/state govt.
28. Because the QLD LNP have a track record so abysmal and corrupt that Labor can offer a compelling counter narrative that makes up for the media bias most of the time. If the QLD LNP didn't have such a catastrophic record every time they get in, labor would almost never win. If we had an honest media landscape, the LNP would never win again.
29. The majority didn’t vote LNP, based on first preferences. You’re very much a shill account & not very good at it.
30. LNP good, Labor bad has been the Murdoch and 9 mantra for decades. If the Coalition weren't so utterly incompetent they'd still be in power.
31. North Brisbane has had a lot of new residents from interstate who are unaware/ don't care about the Newman chaos. Many are also anti Dan Andrews/Labor. Also with Redcliffe having Yvette D'ath retire, the seat was up for grabs.
32. Even former prime ministers from both sides of the aisle have confirmed the massive issue presented by the political propaganda of conservative owned media and called for a royal commission. Keep sticking your head in the sand if you prefer, but it just makes you seem foolish to anyone who has actually worked in Australian media and lived it first hand.
33. I have some opinions, but I'm not clear on whether you mean pro or anti voice; as I've heard people make statements towards both.
34. It’s not though. Because what you’re saying will happen hasn’t actually happened. There is no bill on the table. Additionally if KAP does bring it forward, it will fail. Because the LNP has categorically stated they will not change abortion legislation. Attempting to change it is political suicide in Australia and they know it. There actually has been youth crimes committed by repeat offenders. So one of these things is real and the other is a scare campaign lol. I honestly don’t know how anyone who can tie their shoes can’t see that.
35. Bullshit. It's the lived experience of many in Mackay, Townsville Cairns, Rockhampton. Where the ALP is losing seats and the swing is large.
36. Maybe they could have been more supportive of funding and services going into indigenous communities to nip these problems in the bud rather with targeted programs to end social breakdown because of massive inequalities in health, education, housing, access to fresh and affordable food and functional families that aren't ridden with substance abuse and DFSV. But then they'd be overtly envious and would be constantly complaining about indigenous people getting too many benefits. And its always a reversion to trope understanding of these issues and that dreadful bigoted defence of we're all Australians! They don't like it when their comparable wealthy white privileges are threatened, do they?
37. Don't forget conveniently blaming the Murdoch bogeyman like OP has done. Doing so for every election they lose allows ALP voters a convenient excuse instead of doing some real reflection about why they lost.
38. Conservatives don’t vote based off of facts but feelings of which you’re stating literally. ‘This happened to me so’ That’s not facts.
39. So Fare evasion is the” crime “ that Queenslanders are worried about
40. Crime has trended downward for the last 100 years. And women’s rights have trended upwards. So no issues with either then.
41. Do you actually believe that the entire ‘other side’ of the voting spectrum is influenced solely by Murdoch’s rags? That tells us more about what influences your vote than anything else.
42. That's fine by me, anyone that believes Murdoch has mind control powers over half the electorate isn't someone who's opinion I'm going to heed on who constitutes "foolish". Especially if they're in media. It's a complete cop-out and unbelievably lazy.
43. I would suggest to you the ABC was pretty aggressively pro-voice.
44. If you check my post and comment history you’ll see I actually work in youth crime and would argue that I understand more about the issues rounding youth crime than most. Access to health care and the potential of losing said access is in my opinion a far bigger issue. Feel free to disagree. It’s clear we already don’t see eye yo eye on many things and I’m doubtful you’ve the ability to adjust your views when presented with new credible information.
45. So how is someone that doesn't currently live in those areas (but has) meant to tell the difference between a racially coded beat up (which happens every election without fail) and crime escalation?
46. Pretty racists to be blaming indigenous for the rampant violent crime in Queensland, isnt it? Labor was in charge, labor made the policy, labor allocated the funding, labor had no fucking clue, just said the crime didnt exists.
47. You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink Indigenous don’t want to change
48. Skinner meme here 'is it me that's out of touch ...' nar it's the media. Anyone that doesn't agree with me must be low IQ and swayed by a few glossy billboards and headlines. While ironically the left harped on a fear porn about abortion that arrived on the media picture over nothing. If the media was really right leaning they wouldn't have parroted Labor's talking points on an abortion ban fear
49. Oh come on. Every person with a functioning brain knows Murdoch is **hard** right.
50. Facts, not anecdotes. [https://ibb.co/RGKVZPs](https://ibb.co/RGKVZPs) Mackay and Townsville had double digit swings not because they read Murdoch, but because they have been victims.
51. No. I'm not stating its happening to me you literal twit. Look at crime stats of individual LGA's. But grouping it all at a state level cause crime is down in se corner it hides increases at the local level. Shit, let's just group all crime stats across Australia, when people whine about crime in Alice Springs we can call them stupid cause the stats say crime is down. It's exactly this condescending arrogant attitude that has lost Labor the election, and rightly so.
52. I do not believe in anything that comes for a pack of lying cvnts, called the labor party. Right from the get go in 2015, they told us the our then minor crime problem could be fixed by them and their progressive policies. That was a fucking lie, and by the end of it one of our local MPs (aaron harper) even stood up called Townsville's victims of crime as nothing more than an LNP rent a crowd, so fuck them and their dodgy statistics. As for evidence, burning stolen cars in our suburbs, teenage criminals in Audis doing circle work in our main street intersections, stolen cars deliberately targeting emergency vehicle our our roads, being threatened with being gutted with a knife, pretty much does it for me. And remember anecdotal evidence is only problematic in a a scientific inquiry, not an issue for answering a loaded question like yours.
53. You were literally given evidence in the other thread when you keep parroting this bullshit. https://ibb.co/RGKVZPs Then have the fall to say anyone that voted for lnp based on this is stupid. One day Kid, I hope you grow up.
54. It's not mind control power, it's focusing the conversation. Every election is about something for the majority of people and when people are going to the polls with only one topic in the news then that's the topic they may vote on. The issue with the Murdoch owned press is that they get to set the topic, which is rehashed by our diminished private and public broadcasters. So it's not telling you what to think, it's drowning out the discourse to focus on one or two items that line up with a conservative world view.
55. I mean, I can only really offer my own perspective - which is what I individually watched, read and listened to. That's going to be widely different to what you may have been exposed to, kinda have to assume on probability. I remember panels like Q&A appearing to demonstrate both sides well, and on the radio there were interviews with both sides. The reporters covered the 'no side' verbally, but I would say there were less direct interviews. It would have appeared 'pro-voice' in comparison to any other mainstream outlet, all of which are conservative and/or Murdoch aligned, but I think there's more nuance to it. [The Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/dec/04/jacinta-price-declined-52-abc-interview-requests-voice-referendum) on the same topic: All ABC teams reported it was “significantly more difficult getting no voices to speak on the record”. Warren Mundine was confirmed twice and pulled shortly in the week before the show. Fair Australia, which was handling the official No Campaign, would not suggest any other representatives. Q+A had many people declining invitations. “Prominent no campaigners Warren Mundine and Jacinta Nampijinpa Price and Liberal senator Kerrynne Liddle were invited most weeks,” Neither Price nor Mundine appeared on 7.30 “despite repeated requests” My general view is that if you want an organisation to fail, but you're in charge of it, you deliberately mismanage it - and in the case of the ABC, apply pressure occasionally on your journalists. For example, look at how many articles were written about the 'bias' demonstrated by the ABC; pretty effective at the time at sowing doubt, eh? Another, their coverage of the Labor government is harsher than that of the LNP - think about it, how many stories about Gladis, or John, did we really get that were 'meaty'; Shanks had to push that, and leak the parliament house sex scandal to independent journalists because the ABC wouldn't publish. My point is, they shut down the stories that really matter to favor the LNP, amplify wedge issues from the Greens, and critic ALP governments disproportionately in comparison. They will go 'left' on low level issues, especially those that the youth are interested in, but on what really counts, they'll either deliberately play dumb or not report at all. Don't even get me going about Media Watch. However, that's me just ranting an opinion I've formed over the last decade after seeing their coverage of an extremely corrupt LNP government not be sufficient for the most part. Idk man, what's your thoughts?
56. The Yes vote was fait accompli until the Murdoch media came out swinging.
57. You’ve changed the goal posts now. You see this started as someone having a dig about the ‘youth crime epidemic’ scare propaganda going away the moment LNP were elected. I mentioned we now have abortion scare propaganda. Instead of acknowledging it as scare propaganda you believe it’s legitimate due to your obvious political bias and inability to put that aside. I explained that it’s not a legitimate threat. There’s no chance of this happening and it hasn’t in fact happened or even begun to happen. Youth crime has and does happen. It is real. You don’t need to be involved in it to know it’s real. ‘Epidemic’ or not is debatable but it’s at least real enough to have the debate. Now you’ve attacked my character by insinuating that I care more about youth crime than health care. A bog standard, juvenile ad hominem. Not that it’s remotely relevant, but I will clarify for others, that I do in fact value health care highly. If there was even the smallest possibility of abortion rights being removed in QLD I would be protesting along with half the state. But there isn’t. There is no chance. It’s 100% a scare campaign. An actual, real, currently active scare campaign with zero merit. It will continue as long as the LNP is in power the same as the youth crime one did with labour in power.
58. You could start by not taking the default position of "this isn't the lived experience of many people", when you've just admitted you have NFI. Perhaps even realise that Murdoch isn't the only media outlet with an agenda and the skewed stats from other outlets are also bullshit. You can't trust any media in the country. ALP supporters just select Murdoch to bash because they are the outlets that don't support their arguments. If you can't verify, take it with a grain of salt regardless of what party it supports. Only rely on what you CAN verify.
59. Are you completely stupid? The law and order debate is a surrogate dog whistle for our own northern KKK community. For the vast majority of the last decade, the Liberal National coalition were in charge of welfare policy. They destroyed the CDEP, the primary targeted welfare measure for providing employment and the human dignity for functional communities. No one is saying crime doesn't exist, except maybe now for Crusafulli who redefined it last week as not absolute numbers but cases per 100,000 head of population - the complete antithesis of what he had done for the previous four years!!! And if you're keen to support treating 10 years as adults and having capacity and maturity with a mens rea to be tried as adults, I'm sure you're equally supportive of 10 year olds having capacity and maturity to legally engage in sexual relations as well as be a sex worker, buy and smoke tobacco products, enter licensed premises to consume alcohol, obtain a driver's licence and operate heavy machinery and aircraft, obtain a firearms licence and weaponry including knives that they can carry and join the ADF and operate all the kit available to them. So if you think all that sounds stupid, you've kind of just destroyed your own adult crime, adult time bullshit which is so simplistic, any fuckwit without grey matter at the tip of the brain stem can mindlessly support!!! In the meantime, go back to first principles of ensuring that households have functional families and parents that are kept responsible for that rather simple job of adulting and running a tight ship, keeping kids under control and away from trouble!!!
60. It does not follow that's the reason people voted right. You can't accept that people vote right for reasons other than Murdoch. Some do, but not all. In the same way some vote left because of left leaning media.
61. That’s a very fair and reasoned response. I found there was a reasonable amount of editorialising in favour of the yes case and certainly I think the no voices were subject to a lot more intense questioning and scrutiny than the yes voices. We also had the infamous Leigh Sales memo. Personally I remember watching an episode of the Drum where they had three yes voices and one very tepid no voice, who pretty much said ‘there are lots of great reasons to vote yes, but for me it’s soooo hard but I’ve very reluctantly decided to vote no because (insert reason)’. I have no problems whatsoever with left wing media orgs but the public broadcaster shouldn’t be one (anymore than it should be a right wing media org).
62. I’m generally indifferent to the Murdoch press but we owe them a debt of gratitude there
63. I didn’t change the goalposts at all. I clarified how the anti choice agenda being brought forward in the state parliament was a massive issue. You brought up youth crime. You continue to bring it up. I politely commented stating that if you would like to discuss youth crime check my post history as I’ve spoke about it extensively on there. I also pointed out that you and I clearly don’t see eye to eye and you don’t seem like the type of person who wants to change their opinion when presented with new information (this is evident based on your comments here) and thus there wasn’t much point in arguing. You then downvoted my comment and replied anyways because you don’t seem to have the self-restraint to listen when people don’t give you consent. Perhaps something the people in your life should be acutely aware of for their own protection. Abortion access is under threat. If it wasn’t the ruling government would have explicitly said so instead of saying “It’s not in *our* plan” over and over. In fact several members of that party did say it was under threat but couldn’t talk about it until after the election. Don’t be mistaken, an abortion bill will be voted on by this government sometime before the next election and the LNP will support it. Either through a “conscience vote” or just outright.
64. Well, as mentioned, it's an election ritual to get the racist foghorn out and the Murdoch press jump right on it. Is every other election a racial beat up, but this time is different? Why does the brisbane LNP (state and council) run on crime when by your own words it's not an issue in Brisbane? I'll accept it's an issue in some regional areas, but you need to accept the racial and electioneering aspects of this also.
