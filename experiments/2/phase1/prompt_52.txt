Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. I mean I can get any graph you like I just chose that one as a catch all to show the issue. Interestingly enough traffic related offenses are falling in Townsville. https://preview.redd.it/isr4fh33i7xd1.jpeg?width=1339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32dc6a6405c3869cc4c217cecfec39d79fb4e6e2 more violent crime is generally increasing however (sorry can only post one pic at a time.
2. Seems I have been bested again by another keyboard warrior. Alas what am I to do
3. He’s said that they won’t be touching abortion law and until they do, I think we’ve got to believe them. It would be the fastest ticket out of power there is, and they know that. I’m hoping the US election will be a massive demonstration of that fact.
4. there's bigger things in this world than a child eating food and anyone debating otherwise is a dotard. You don't get to take food from a child an demand asylum from ridicule.
5. I can agree on that, if you can agree that there are far more instances of serious crime being committed by youths. I’m fairly certain I’ve never seen groups of teens wandering the streets and breaking into houses armed with machetes in my life before this.
6. Nah no offence taken, just genuinely curious to know what your experience is, thanks for sharing
7. https://preview.redd.it/k0fgfju9i7xd1.jpeg?width=1351&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5469acf23a91e7fb13599bf39b05e2b867b96583 I know the LNP was making big hay with stolen vehicles in townville however and you can see why.
8. Nah dude. Pull your head out of your ass. You said something was an issue, I provided the state data saying otherwise, and you don't believe it because...? There's no beneficial debate to be had when I don't know where you're moving the goal posts to.
9. after voting against it and backing people voting against it, yeah - so solid. NT are now able to imprison 10 year olds. you still think a fucking lunch is the problem?
10. I live and work in the communities where it’s a growing problem. Everyday people like myself try to stem the influx of crime in general not just youth crime. We try to educate and show these people there is more to living a life where you are constantly looking over your shoulder. As for the youth we need to change the parents way of thinking. kids only know what they see on a day to day basis. It’s why the cycle continues to grow. Unfortunately it mostly stems from money. Or lack there off. But changing the way a person thinks is truly a running into a brick wall type situation. Violence breeds violence, education helps but some people don’t want to learn or change. It’s all they know. So why bother changing. If I can help one person, then I see it as a win. I just can’t stand the comman person living in their perfect bubble when there is no such thing as perfect. We as a human race need to change. Why can’t we all just get along. Help your neighbor instead of ignoring them. It’s a dream I guess
11. What goal posts. Seeing people broke into times stolen, vandalism, bashed, victimized. Not much of a prize if that’s the goal
12. It seems that you can’t venture past assuming the worst of people. It’s fine. The true values of a keyboard warrior
13. Excuses, far from it. Again you assume. Assumption is the mother of all fuckups.
14. Nothing like getting outraged over shit that hasn't happened, and is unlikely to happen. But hey... go off
15. I’m happy to have a civilised conversation, but I’m not going to be spoken to like that, and I’m not going to be wilfully misunderstood. Best wishes.
16. The. Stats. Of. All. Those. Things. Are. Down. I don't know what else I can say here. The goal posts of the debate, you dunce. There can't be a meaningful discussion if you don't accept the data.
17. You've made it abundantly clear that you are a fucking moron. I was just trying to be helpful.
18. You are right and the real world is wrong. My bad
19. There’s no other explanation your street is just randomly ripe with youth crime while everyone else around you in a supposed nice area doesn’t have an issue? Cmon mate. It’s either that or you’re exaggerating to make a point on the internet which is probably more likely now I think about it.
20. Nothing like dismissing legitimate concerns because you dont understand and it doesn't affect you
21. I am dead serious. Do you still think a fucking lunch is the problem? answer my question.
22. you really are both a dotard and a coward to not reply. You do not get to take to moral high ground here when you're ignorantly defending a party you didn't even know just legalised imprisoning prepubescent children in the Northern Territory. Trying to play the political correctness card because you cant think of a retort does not work in this argument. You are disgusting.
23. Again with the name calling. If the stats say that 80% of our country lives above the poverty line does that make it true. It would if you polled everyone single person in this state. But sadly this does not happen. Honestly how many people of some position that deals with this matter do you actually know. 100-200 police officers. Does that account for the other what 10000 officers in the country. What about the ones who live and work in rural areas that deal with this on a day to day basis. Sure. Let’s all move to the golden neighborhood where everyone lives in wonderland filled with love and joy. What about the young families how have no choose but to live in areas that aren’t rich. It’s called the real world. Try coming out from under your rock from time to time. Spend a day in the real world and see how life actually works.
24. Why do you assume anything. I haven’t attacked you on a personal level. Called you names. I haven’t attacked you. I have only stated the fact that people live under rocks. Ie, have no real grasp on the world we live in.
25. Keep up saving the world your doing a bang up job
26. No sadly you can’t. You can’t seem to reason with it either. Opinions are like assholes. Everyone has one
27. >If the stats say that 80% of our country lives above the poverty line does that make it true. Yes. >It would if you polled everyone single person in this state That's... That's not statistics. >Honestly how many people of some position that deals with this matter do you actually know. Irrelevant. I think a fundamental issue here is you don't understand what stats and data actually means. You don't poll the population to see what crimes are happening. You have arrest reports and sentencing etc etc. Logical reasoning doesn't work, hence the name calling.
28. Hardly helps calling anyone names. It only makes the obvious keyboard warrior shine bright.
29. Maybe I should move in next to you. Seems you live in heaven street
30. And what all the instances that aren’t put on paper. You know the ones that involve youth. Because they are underage or the police are trying to deal with the problem in the real world. Again the stats don’t reflect anything. They cover up the problem so it looks good. But in reality it is far from the truth. Instead the common person who lives in there bubble chooses to not see the world for what it actually is. They choose to believe in what the media tell them on a day to day basis. Honestly come out into the real world and actually live abit. You would be surprised to find out how much of the problems are clouded over. There are so many subjects that fall into this category. I choose to go into the world and deal with these problems. Try to fix something. Something is better than nothing living in a make believe place where all your magical fantasies come to pass does not help anyone accept yourself. It’s a sad fact that no one is willing to help anyone else. Everyone has to be on top. What happens when there nothing left to be on top of. As I said before in amongst the name calling and idiotic comments, this country needs to change. Until it does we keep going around and around stuck in a cycle. And this all started because of a statement against youth crime. And we end up in political debate on issues that will never change. People will always be different. Some good some bad. I’m going to ask you a genuine question. There is no right or wrong answer to this question. But I would like you to answer it. I’m guessing you won’t but it won’t be nice to hear your answer. I’ll give you mine after you answer. If you had three wishes, what would you wish for ?
31. Hate to break it to you, but you might have typed this on a keyboard.
32. A make believe fairy land where everyone’s wishes come true
33. It's like watching a child become self aware. Fascinating really.
34. Do you feel better for calling me names. Maybe you feel better helping the people that are affected by this in the real world. Have you stopped to think for a second I’m baiting you now. Clearly you think that you live in a perfect world. With no troubles to be had. The fact of the matter will not change. You live under the rock. It will crush you one with its enormous weight I just hope that it dosent affect the people around you. Not everyone needs to pay the price for stupidity
35. 😃 I think that's enough internet for you today, gramps.
36. Again assuming about me. Do you know who I am what I have lived through, my financial standing, my political or religious views. No you don’t. As I know nothing about you, hence why I don’t assume a thing about you. But you call me names to justify to yourself that you are right and everyone else is wrong. Does it make you feel big and important. You’re just another keyboard warrior that lives in a bubble. Like I said before I really hope you come out into the sunshine one day. You will be truly surprised at what you find. Life is not as perfect as what you perceive it to be.
37. Channel 7 had Robbie Katter on early last night, he said he was absolutely putting abortion reform to the floor as quickly as possible
38. One of the most impactful causes of cost of living pressures, is rent. And Queenslanders just handed the keys to the people most likely to support landlords.
39. Labor were always in trouble after being in power for three terms and, rightly or wrongly, being blamed for the cost of living crisis. Here’s hoping the small majority deters Crisafulli from going full Newman.
40. Pretty gutted. Palaszczuk just held on too long, delusional about her overall support. If she had have moved on a year earlier things would have looked a lot different. Miles got in and was immediately copping ~20% swings in Inala and Ipswich West. The damage was done and lasting. He did an amazing job of getting it back but it was ultimately hopeless. I hope Labor keep him, he’s a good dude
41. Wonder what comes first criminalising abortion or privatising what’s left of the public sector
42. This is a trend worldwide though, whoever was running during covid gets kicked out asap once things settled down. Covid straining public systems just made it easy for oppositions to go “see they’re bad”.
43. The fact that LNP had such a poor campaign, without costings and still won shows how easily swayed the population is. It boggles the mind.
44. The fact that my father, a decades long KAP voter, who regularly rubs shoulders with these political freaks and knows all of their insidious back end bullshit, voted for Labor should tell you enough about who Queensland doomed themselves with as their newest Premier. Crisafulli is a fucking weirdo, and was run out of Townsville for his shit. We are worse off, and only idiots with no understanding of the political realities would vote for a man with multiple failed businesses under his belt. He can’t even manage a business properly, how is the fool meant to manage an entire state even with his self indulgent sycophants propping him up?
45. Fucking knew it. Watch this clown state complain about this fuckwit because they “wanted a change”. Democracy is a bit shit when half the people are plebs.
46. Qld is fucked. Seriously who voted for this slime bag with zero credibility and a history of company failures? Qldrs must be desperate for a change.
47. can't wait to just die because the help I need isnt "essential"
48. God help Qld. The bloke can't keep a straight face and commit to Yes or No, so how is he going to provide leadership to manage Qld?
49. Oh for crying out loud, seriously? How dense are people in this freaking state? The LNP are not the good guys. It is dumb to ever vote for them. You suck if you voted for them. And you make me give up on hope that we will ever have a real progressive world with this dumb thing. Guess the rest of the world better get ready because we know it's gonna be the same right wing parties that win.
50. Wow you dumb cunts, for how much Aussies say they hate America, then vote someone in like this, this country has no hope.
51. Welp they goes our energy assets. They’ll be the first thing sold. Anything they can privatise they will. I give them one term and power before Labors back in. Unfortunately Labor got complacent and I think they needed this kick in the backside. But as I said they’ll only be out for one term. On the plus side, maybe we have a chance of not being humiliated over our budget QSAC Olympics.
52. Good one Queensland. Because who likes cheap rego, cheap electricity, bulk-billing GPs, free school lunches and 50c fares, right? No, no, you'd much rather some revolting little weasel who doesn't see women as human. The guy who has the mining industry's hand up his ass like he's a meat puppet. LNP voters are complicit in the decimation of our planet, and they are also responsible for the very predictable shitshow that is about to begin. I am done feeling sorry for the brainwashed people too stupid to get their news from anyone but Murdoch. I have 0 respect for any of them.
53. There's a dude on my street with a sticker on his bin "don't blame me, I voted LNP". All the blame sir. All the blame.
54. Absolutely gutted. What Stevie Miles has achieved in just 10 months is incredible (also top bloke) and this bozo is about to undo it all and worse. Sad day.
55. Can’t wait for the “how could labor do this to us?” When the mining tax is wound back, renewables campaigns are ended, electricity prices skyrocket, no more energy relief payments, public transport fares go back up and health/teachers etc get gutted.
56. At what point do we take a page from France's book and fucking riot.
57. Fuck you: - Bonney - Broadwater - Buderim - Burdekin - Burleigh - Burnett - Callide - Chatsworth - Clayfield - Condamine - Coomera - Currumbin - Everton - Glass House - Gregory - Gympie - Ipswich West - Kawana - Lockyer - Maroochydore - Mermaid Beach - Moggill - Mudgeeraba - Nanango - Ninderry - Oodgeroo - Scenic Rim - Southern Downs - Southport - Surfers Paradise - Theodore - Toowoomba North - Toowoomba South - Warrego - Whitsunday May you all be the first to reap the consequences
58. Queenslanders (in parts) are morons who have forgotten the RORTS this party was involved in... Unbelievable how stupid they are...
59. This is just a really bad dream right? I don’t understand. How do I wake up from this nightmare? I feel so angry right now.
60. Guess the next 4 years will be a step backwards to shitville.
61. I can’t believe we voted in a party who wants less reproductive rights, tax cuts to the billionaires who run the coal industry and putting kids in jail instead of feeding them. Well done Queensland.
62. Gutted to see the results. Life is about to get harder for a lot of people, and we have the majority of the state to blame for that!
63. God fucking damnit!! Now I am pissed at the old couple I saw take an LNP brochure on their way in - THEY DID THIS 😤
64. Cant believe people with a networth of anything under 3 million vote for the LNP legit lower class voting the LNP is laughable
65. Reddit clearly has a lot more labor voters than lnp. Despite the all the comments heavily labor biased, lnp voted in.
66. Goodbye 50c public transport, a discount on my Ergon bill and also maybe to my health care rights
67. Honestly think it has less to do with LNP being good and just ALP being so hated.
68. That’s a disappointing result. I imagine Crisawhosits will work hard to regress Queensland and maintain our reputation of being a few decades behind the times.
69. What a smug looking cunt. This election makes me wanna vomit in my mouth. Regional QLD and particularly my family, fuck you. All I can say.
70. For anyone lurking here who voted these morons in: go fuck yourself.
71. I can't wait to watch this dickhead when KAP brings up the abortion bill and he allows a conscience vote. That HAS to be political suicide - it was the one thing he was constantly hammered on, and wormed around answering. I hope Miles sticks around as it's going to be like shooting fish in a barrel
72. God save QLD, we are f***** now. Remindme!in 4 years.
73. I actually have to hand it to Miles, he ran a good campaign and did his best to claw back the absolute hiding Labor were looking at 6 months ago. He was put in the role to take the fall and felt the brunt of voters negative feelings around both AP and the Federal government. I feel the divisive federal Voice campaign and the ripples from it are still having an impact. The displeasure with the Federal government is still top in voters minds. LNP just had to autopilot it in, and that's basically what they did. It will probably end up a 53 seat win which is a strong win and mostly on the back of the federal swing. The Greens have been all but wiped out in Queensland. No doubt they can thank Lydia Thorpe for this and her continued antics. Bad timing for them. So, now instead of a government that's a little bit left, we have a government that's a little bit right. This sub needs to show some resilience. Behaving like this is the first time you've faced adversity. You'll be ok. Good luck LNP, don't fuck it up.
74. Take note of family and friends gloating about the LNP victory. In 12 months time when shit is hitting the fan, you'll be hard pressed in finding someone to admit they voted for them.
75. This slimy motherfucker is going to put the state back 20 years, enjoy it.
76. Not to sound like a tin foil hatter (I’m not) but at this stage I’m starting to wonder if our votes even matter. If power and money can sway votes, as mentioned in other comments I’m seeing, maybe we were destined to be doomed regardless.
77. Wow. Just wow. You'd think from this sub there would have been a Labor landslide. Did ya'll forget to vote?
78. Absolutely hollowbrain move to vote the LNP in. I knew there were always gonna be morons out there but a majority of morons?
79. Well that's a disappointing thing to see first thing in the morning
80. I'd give it THREE NANOSECONDS before the newly minted LNPs tell us that the reckless spending stops right now. What they really mean is that we are changing the focus of recklessly spending far more than we're earning and by reducing taxes on business and the wealthy there will be far less 'given away' to the halt, the lame and the lazy. I give you the new movie 'Back to the Future 2024', where nothing is as it seems, but we've somehow 'seen it all before'.
81. Congratulations Queensland, enjoy your 4 years of being railed by the LNPenis .
82. Absolutely devastated and scared for what we're all in for. I sincerely hope these LNP voters are the first to have their jobs cut so that they never make this mistake again. Steven Miles, one of the best political leaders I've seen, deserves a congratulations for saving Labor from another 2012 wipeout.
83. Really thought Queensland would pull through this run, check my comments. Truly do not care from here now what happens to this state. Labour did what they could to actually help QLDers but they showed that actually having a state government that helps their state is not worth keeping on cause "we've had them for a few years". Back at 2019 federal election level. Why bother from here trying to help anyone, all you'll get it voted out by psychos who think helping others is a detriment. Sucks to say, but we reap what others sow. Shame that it's not even been ten years since the last failure of a LNP government + abortion rights on the line was worth anything. Got what you wanted QLD, enjoy it.
84. The blind bought the crime agenda. Watch it go backwards under Libs
85. QLD fucked around, now they get four years to find out.
86. I appreciate people’s right to choose but I seriously wish people were critical thinkers. QLD chose - someone who deflects questions (I know Miles does this too but not to the extent that Chrissafulli does) - a party that didn’t reveal their costings. “We’ve got concepts of a plan” - a party who’s deceptively used statistics to make claims that aren’t true (Youth crime) Other than crime in regional areas, I seriously don’t know a good reason why you would vote for a party like this. I don’t think, “it’s time for a change,” is a good reason. I’m not really surprised at the result though, most people aren’t critical when it comes to politics. That’s how Trump got elected.
87. Can somebody please ELI5 how he and the LNP are going to ruin the state? /genq
88. We’re about to find out exactly how much of a slime ball he is
89. Well done QLD, can’t help but shit in your pants.
90. I wonder if they’ll criminalise medical cannabis in Queensland ? Seems like a conservative move.
91. Campbell Newman all over again. But Newman got so fucking hated on his term, he lost election. I am one of them, because he cut the emergency service cadets, and when turned 18 I was happy to vote him out.
92. Fingers crossed the anti-abortion stuff really wasn't part of the plan.
93. Well guess it's time to go work in the mining sector.
94. Is anyone surprised? There was zero chance Labor was winning this time.
95. Disappointing as all shit, and as a woman, fucking terrifying.
96. Nothing like positive reinforcement for running a campaign based fear mongering. More of the same in the future I guess.
97. If everyone hates him! How tf did he win? Boomers are still a majority population ey?
98. Literally fucking disgusting, I am so fucking disappointed in my state
99. I think I’m legitimately going to cry. FFS, Queensland, what have you done?!?!
100. I put greens 1, labor 2 and LNP last but what’s done is done now and it’s time to try and make strawberry jam from pig shit. So on that note I see people talking about LNP being the type to privatise everything. Having little knowledge of the market what do I need to keep an ear out for IPOs?
101. it's so fucking over. for someone talking about people not buying labor's fear, he sure did spend A LOT OF MONEY on nothing but a fear campaign to win this election
102. It’s the nearly dead’s that did this. There should be a ban on nearly dead’s voting
103. Is there anyone here who voted for the LNP? I'm genuinely curious why. It seems like they're set to make things worse for people while benefiting corporations that donated large sums to this election. Were you paid to vote for the LNP, or were you just dissatisfied with the current state of things in your area? Have you looked at the LNP's agenda? Things don't seem likely to improve
104. Time to leave QLD it was good while it lasted
