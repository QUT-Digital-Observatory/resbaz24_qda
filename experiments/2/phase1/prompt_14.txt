Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Oh Lordy. I was speaking in shorthand. I accept unreservedly that there is a difference between winning a majority of seats and winning a majority of votes. Now where does this incredible 'gotcha' actually get you?
2. I’m not suggesting you had anything to do with those votes, but there are a myriad of voices out there, not just sky/fox/abc/pick your poison. The majority is right literally is democracy. What does it mean if not that? The difference between ‘the earth is flat’ and ‘you chose the wrong government’ is that one is a scientific fact and the other is a matter of opinion. They are not comparable.
3. Not for the content of the OP it's not. The OP is specifically blaming the election result on the spread of Sky News into the regions.
4. > The increase in royalties did however also antagonise future investment in coal mining in our state what's your evidence that this happened?
5. 1. miles isn’t responsible for every action of the labour government lmao, not least the labour government 3 decades ago. 2. the absolute worst fucking time for the state in the last 30 years was the tiny stint campbell newman and the fucking libs did before getting kicked out for totally fucking the state. oh yeah did i mention the little greaseball crisafulli was part of that newman government? 3. yes cunt. he’s only been in less than a year so i have no doubt he has plans that haven’t happened yet, so when he makes an election promise im inclined to believe it. politicians are supposed to earn your vote. is he supposed to say “i’ll do nothing for you, please vote for me”? for what fucking reason are you buying into the libs election promises, and for what fucking reason do you even think their promises are beneficial for the state?
6. The reason millionaires got the rebates is because it’s administratively cheaper to just give it to everyone than to set up some team to make sure a few millionaires don’t get a $1000 rebate.
7. There is zero evidence Labor lost due to what you're claiming. The majority of Queensland are not racist misogynists. Not sure if you're racist but you are absolutely a misogynist.
8. Lol going hard at applying labels to stereotype people into convenient boxes so you can set them on fire. You can't stand anyone having a differing opinion, and that your opinion is very clearly NOT how the majority of people in this state feel at this instant. Men are very much in danger, the equality we all want and that we've been told for a generation is the ethical stance, which it is, has been turned into gender revenge by the people you voted for. Maybe you are young and haven't had the experience but I can tell you first hand that there are men getting screwed who are not wife beaters by the people you support. I honestly hope it does not come back to bite you.
9. i thought you said you weren't going to provide any more responses champ? that didn't last long. how embarrassing for you lol
10. Closer to mutual understanding, we should hope. There's no gotcha, there's speaking in shorthand and there's saying things that are false. Perhaps you mis-spoke, perhaps you were just wrong, either way you're having trouble admitting it. It might also be worth taking a look at yourself and asking why you made the choice of words you did.
11. > The majority is right literally is democracy Again, it's not. It has nothing to do with right and wrong, correct and incorrect. > What does it mean if not that? What I already said - Democracy is intended to be ***the will*** *of the people*. It does not mean that the majority is right/correct. Democracy is about putting more power in the hands of the people, it does not mean that how they wield that power is "right", it doesn't prevent them from using that power to make their own lives worse. Re-read [the comment you first tagged yours on to](https://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/1gdnch2/there_have_been_allot_of_posts_here_following_the/lu3bhse/), I am replying to you in that context. > you chose the wrong government No-one says this on its own, it's a strawman. It's leaving open every conceivable semantic interpretation of "right/wrong". You need to include a context: > If you voted for the LNP because you're frustrated with cost of living, then you voted for the wrong party. > If you voted for the LNP because you want more stable, higher-paying jobs in regional QLD, then you voted for the wrong party. > If you voted for the LNP because you want a government that cares more about your problems than you think Labour does, then you voted for the wrong party. To go back to your first comment: > If you think that many people are so clearly wrong, it might also be worth taking a look at yourself and asking whether you’re wrong, or at least why they made the decision they did. I agree, so I do, and have done for all of my adult life, which is why I understand their decision, and can demonstrate how they are wrong. Dogged defence of a position is not always evidence of a lack of self-awareness. It can be a result of it. Enlightenment values, the ability to self-critique, do not require you to yield to populism.
12. Ohhhh so it's specifically the wording you don't like, not the actual connotation? So logically you would agree the newscorp, who owns skynews, has a stranglehold on regional Australia?
13. I actually used to work in coal. The royalty increase lost us a lot of business.
14. Can any Reditor respond to an idea they don't like without name calling? Feels like I'm back in the school yard. The internet emboldens people to drop courtesy and just be outright rude.
15. Imagine being this fragile and afraid of everything. how embarrassing lol
16. In what sense have I had trouble admitting it? The moment it was pointed out that it was a majority of electorates and not majority of the population I responses "Yes, fair point" and made the same admission again to you. Sounds pretty accepting to me.
17. Obviously alot here turns on what one means when they say the majority is "right". Clearly we were using that term in different ways. That's fine. You may be able to provide justification for why you believe voters were wrong if they voted for the LNP because they're frustrated with the cost of living, but again, that is a different thing to what is means to be 'right;' when we say 'the earth is not flat'. I'm sure you would acknowledge the difference between established scientific facts and justified political beliefs about prospective matters. I agree that defence of a position is not always evidence of lack of self awareness. In some cases it will be, in others it will not.
18. >Ohhhh so it's specifically the wording you don't like, not the actual connotation? No, it's specifically the whole argument the OP was making about the reach of Sky news. Your argument about NewsCorp is different.
19. did you bother to actually read the article champ? because it actually completely disproves your point. > The AREAA report also forecast there would be about $142 billion in projects (up from $130 billion last year) over the next five years, with an expected 28,260 new production-related jobs. little hint champ. It pays to actually read gthe articles you're citing as evidence, as this reduces the chances that you actually post evidence that completely disproves your own point. like you did here how embarrassing for you fkn lol
20. Just look at the number of posts by lefties on Reddit in the Brisbane and Queensland subs winging about the election result. That's what we're doing here. If your minority buddies hadn't been "fragile and afraid" we wouldn't be having this conversation. There was a question, I answered it in a polite and civil manner. Surely you can see the duplicity that you (and I!) want equality and respect but all you can do is try to ridicule.
21. > I was speaking in shorthand. That's you making an excuse. And it's not a fair point, it's the truth. You said something false. They said something true. You used the language of equivocation. And you admitted nothing to me. You said you "accept that there's a difference". When I'm wrong, I tend to say, "I was wrong". But like I said, you're having a hard time with it, and you should examine why. Anyway, this thread sucks.
22. > Clearly we were using that term in different ways. I don't think so. Can you express how? > I'm sure you would acknowledge the difference between established scientific facts and justified political beliefs about prospective matters. Sure, but that's not what this is. I didn't say justifiable. I said demonstrable. The LNP has a track record, and it flies in the face of what the people in my hypotheticals care about. If option A is demonstrated to result in the outcome you don't want, but you choose it anyway, then you made the *wrong* choice. Wrong as in incorrect. To add, if you make a prediction about something based on bullshit reasons and no evidence, and that prediction comes true for other reasons, then you're still wrong. That's wrong in the logical sense.
23. Do you understand how newscorp works? Skynews talking points are used as news in all their papers and online platforms. It's the same news. So a paper in Coffs harbour is part of skyness reach. Does that make sense?
24. Did you read the rest of it? AREEA showed that for the first time QLD had gone backwards in both project capital (by 15%) and prospective employment (by 20%). 10 future projects dropped to 6 and workers required dropped 4400 to 2600. BHP says they are now looking towards other jurisdictions and that they are no longer looking at making any new greenfield investments in QLD. Other big miners are also now hesitant in further investments in QLD. I never said in the short term it didn’t increase the royalties. In fact I acknowledged that it did increase them. My point was long term it has disincentivised coal mining in QLD. Selectively reading isn’t helping your point. Gov projections already back up what I said in terms of royalties coming back down as well. We may actually end up worse off in the future should the AREEA be right. Edit: lol your figures were for the whole nation as well btw from that article. Not for QLD. If you had read the “…Friday predicted 28,000 new jobs… across the country between 2023-2028…” then you would have known as that was further expanded on in the part you’re quoting. Maybe don’t attempt next time to dunk on someone without actually reading the article properly yourself.
25. > Just look at the number of posts by lefties on Reddit in the Brisbane and Queensland subs winging about the election result. I;m so sorry. I didn't realise you had to experience the trauma of reading comments written by people of a different political persuasion to you. That must have been incredibly difficult. I understand now why you are so upset and emotional. I hope, with time, you are able to heal from this. lol
26. It’s not an excuse champ, it’s a simple explanation of what I said. Of course, you won’t believe this but I actually considered saying “won a majority is seats” in my initial post but just couldn’t be bothered to explain it. Clearly that would have been easier. Accept it or not, that’s entirely your call. Likewise whether you accept me saying unreservedly that I accept the point being made. You must be a delight at dinner parties.
27. I was using ‘right’ in the sense that it is often expressed in a democracy that the election results are the will of the people and the people are always right. You may have heard this maxim before? I I understand your point but I don’t think you’re ’right’. You may be more likely right than wrong, but to the extent you’re suggesting it is a foregone conclusion then I can’t agree with that.
28. the fact you’re getting downvoted for schooling someone who “champed” you tells you everything you need to know about this sub.
29. hey buddy our royalties are already way higher than the other states and yet they still come here. i wonder why that is? almost like natural resources aren’t equally distributed around the world or country. they still make huge fucking profits. you ate up their slop and believed them when they said they’re no longer looking to invest in qld. they’ve said that since the dawn of time and they’re gonna keep saying it because they want to keep the royalties down by pretending they’re gonna run off. you cited a massive mining corp to prove they’re running away from qld. that’s like citing exxon mobil as a source to prove climate change isn’t real ya goober
30. Dude why the ridicule? I've got the standard ridicule you issue to virtually everyone you respond to: 1) how embarrassing for you 2) champ You clearly have a fairly high opinion of yourself and looking at your typically condescending responses you make to most people you are the smartest guy around here. But your vocab is fairly repetitive.
31. > often expressed in a democracy that the election results are the will of the people and the people are always right Mate if you can provide an instance of that being said by *anyone* intelligent, let alone "often", I'll accept that that's what you meant, but this just reads like more of what's proving to be habitual truth-bending and post-hoc justification on your part. And if it is how you're using it, it's a stupid way to use it. Wrong, even. And it's not me being right. Literally thousands of years of people smarter than me have made it right. All truth has a confidence interval, but cowards use that to equivocate and avoid arguing themselves into a corner. Pretty predictable behaviour from someone who can't admit being wrong. Anyway this conversation sucks, let me know when you find that source.
32. So doesn't that now render your argument about Skynews reach redundant?
33. Yep, I knew that coming into the subreddit and it’s why I rarely even comment. It’s actually really unfortunate because I do genuinely want to discuss things when I do comment. It’s why I upvote comments if they’re being constructive and not resorting to calling me names. But it’s rare on the qld and Aus political subreddits and even here on the brissie subreddit. I miss when people could respect others with differing views.
34. Ok mate. Now, I will confess this is a maxim I've heard said on various occasions throughout my life and I have some vestigial recollection of John Howard or someone similar saying it but I cannot locate that quote now (if it even exists). In any event, a quick google will tell you that EB White said "*Democracy is the recurrent suspicion that more than half of the people are right more than half the time*" and a number of variations on that theme (my favourite is Mencken's "*Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard*"). That same google search will also produce about a dozen articles such as "*Think democracy means the people are always right? Wrong*" (which is of course very much to your point). So, I stand by my claim that I have heard that phrase said on various occasions and that is the sense in which I was using it. Is it factually correct? Almost certainly not (the election of Hitler is probably proof enough of that, albeit an extreme example). For whatever it's worth, I really was not attempting to engage in 'post-hoc justification', I was simply telling you what I meant when I said what I said (however poorly expressed it was). Even if that maxim is to a large degree factually incorrect (which I won't cavil with), I maintain there is a sentiment at its core which I think is at least worth examination. Something like: the democratic outcome reflects the will of the people, and while we may disagree with it, it is if nothing else somewhat presumptuous to say that any one of us knows better than the body politic as a whole. Especially on matters about which reasonable minds may differ, such as the policies that ought to be implemented to deal with complex issues in a democratic society with many competing interests. Without going too much further down this rabbit hole, I don't know if I fully agree that "all truth has a confidence interval". Or perhaps another way of saying this is that I think there's a difference between a 'truth' which has confidence levels and a veridical truth (like speed of light is 299,792,458 metres/second). In my mind that kind of takes us back to the beginning when I suggested that the word 'right' might have a contextual rather than (or in addition to) an absolute meaning. But perhaps its best not to go there again!
35. No, I don't. The Courier-Mail, the Australian and other NewsCorp outlets have pushed complete and fanciful bullshit long before Sky News came out, and they would have continued to do so regardless.
36. Mods complicit in the bullshit. Allowing hate speech continually. Had some rhodes scholar suggesting that “we should riot like the french do” and that got upvoted. Yeah, inciting violence and civil unrest cause your team lost is an appropriate reaction. Any reaction from the mods? Of course not.
37. That's a whole lot of bluster to say, "You're right, I never intended to defend that nonsensical point, I just can't say it in as few words because I feel like I'll lose face". Go read the comment you replied to to see how stupid this conversation is. Then I'm blocking you.
38. Yeah it’s unfortunate. I just think the tone of politics in general has become more heated over time and it’s not even the centrists and left and right leaning people. Those further left have alarmingly become more violent and hateful in their rhetoric against people they disagree with. I’m sure those on the far right are as well, but I see far less of them these days. Most of the mods I’d assume do lean left which is why they allow these types of comments to fly. I’m sure if it had been the same sort of rhetoric but for the other side of politics winning, the person would’ve been banned or had their comment removed at the very least.
39. At some point, you need to agree to disagree. We are going around in circles here.
40. Comment respectfully. Continued harassment may result in you being banned.
41. It was promised to be kept. Time will tell. I love the premise of this policy. Getting more people on public transport promotes active lifestyles. It also reduces the number of cars on the road. I hope that that the money potentially saved by less cars on roads would require less widening of major roads and that be funneled back into public transport infrastructure. Even things like multilevel park n ride satellites that help people on to public transport in our ring/ fridge areas.
42. They said they would keep it....until they come out with "labor left the budget is shambles, we cannot keep this going". Followed by selling everything not nailed down.
43. They called it a 50c farce before it was implemented then went quiet and backtracked after it was clearly popular and effective. They might keep it, but it was funded by the coal royalties they cut. So who knows... they might use it as an excuse "we need to cut x to keep this". Despite the economy being fine and on track for a surplus after 2026 following a bit of a dip to address the cost of living. As far as I can recall anyway
44. Just not the royalties that fund it, plus reduction in rego and power bills
45. This is a really interesting one. Obviously, they're ideologically opposed to the 50c fares. But, seeing their popularity, they promised to keep them. Then: they didn't win many of the seats where public transport is widely used. Scrapping the 50c fares would be political poison, but there will be backbench pressure to do so from some of their rural members. And they might just decide that it won't cost them any seats. And they could probably pin it on Labor, by saying it was never properly costed. Unsustainable. Mind you, they haven't won enough seats to be really comfortable. I think at this stage, their plan would be to grudgingly keep it for this term, and quietly raise fares after the next election.
46. I mean they’ve already promised mining companies they’re going to scrap the progressive resource tax. So my guess is they’ll scrap it. I mean they are complete fools and absolutely corrupt to let mining companies sell our resources at high profits while paying minimal royalties. Repeal that tax and it’s going to be “Oh dear, there’s no more money. Time to scrap these wasteful services that actually help people.”
47. As others have said - as soon as they think they can get away with it, they will scrap it. Probably manufacture some culture war outrage around the same time as a diversion, like some more youth crime horror stories. Not a QLDer but that would be the LNP way.
48. It will be scrapped. The lnp didn't win in brisbane. Regional qld won it for them. The lnp dont need things that primarily benefit the south east to hold government.
49. God I love this Greens & Labor initiative. One that you would never have seen under an LNP govt. This has been one of the most effective policy levers of my voting lifetime and kudos to Miles for being progressive on a positive policy initiative. Now we just need to back it in with better bus services TO trains and higher frequency. “Metro” is a very small cog in a wheel.
50. I really hope they keep it. This is coming from someone who never uses public transport. I would say it's been 5+ years since I have sat on a bus/train/ferry etc. So no vested interest here. First thing is public transport is a loss to the government. It always has been and always will be. The cost of maintaining the infrastructure, be it rail, the vehicles (rail, bus, ferry), terminals etc, it's always going to cost more than the income it makes. Just accept it. Just like schools, hospitals, roads, you are all paying for stuff you may not need right now. I get the whole "user pays" thing, but when you are taxing people sometimes $10 each way to get to work, it can hurt. Not too bad if you are headed to an ok paid job in the city, but if you are a struggling family, and you need to cross town to get to your second/third job for a few hour shift, that shit must hurt. The biggest thing I see from this and I hope those who need it use it. The families who are struggling to make ends meet. I am really hoping they take advantage of the 50c fares to go out on a weekend. Whilst a lot of us take it for granted that you just fill up the car and go somewhere, that $50 to get to the coast and back isn't a reality for some people. Being able to take your family of 4 to the coast and back for $4 is amazing I think. (I am assuming you can get to Surfers etc on the 50c fares). Anyway, like a lot of other people, assume it will get cut next budget. I really hope LNP has turned a page and actually does what is right for it's people this time round. They know what happens if they march in with there "cut everything attitude".
51. I still can't believe people were dumb enough to vote these pricks into power. Guarantee they scrap the 50c fares and then look to sell off more of our critical assets.
52. It sucks that the good ideas are on pause for 4 years. Now we need to wait it out, undo the bs the LNP implements when Labor wins the next election (I do predict a one term government with buyers remorse being obvious within 6mths).. then we have to win again to start making real progress. Already waiting for the 2032 election, then.
53. It's 100% on the way out the moment they think they can get away with it. LNP BCC was livid, absolutely *furious* about the change - there's no way they're not in the ear of their cousins. But admitting to scrapping it would've cost LNP the election, even with the absurd 'youth crime' beat-up.
54. lol.... 6 months then can't afford it... jack up prices higher than the old rate
55. Fuck no are you kidding me? That would involve caring about the poors and acknowledging that the government has a responsibility and citizens lives are negatively affected by things outside their control. None of that makes money for any of the LNP politicians.
56. They will not continue. Various LNP members have already started playing it up as motorists subsidising transit users. Once it becomes enough of an identity issue they'll take it away.
