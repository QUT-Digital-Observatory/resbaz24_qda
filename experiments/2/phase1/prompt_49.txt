Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. There are still too many influencers, real estate agents and bikies.
2. Also silly. I remember the 2019 election being called a landslide too and that was a 2 seat majority!
3. Wow, I didn‚Äôt even think of the age of consent thing. Good odds the feds would step in if they touched it at least. Civil unions are a bit less of a concern now that SSM is federally legislated, but I can see the harm to those that got a civil union pre-SSM and didn‚Äôt worry about marrying (or chose not to).
4. DC has repeatedly refused to commit to blocking a vote, or blocking a conscience vote. You are spreading disinformation.
5. I'm not saying they are. I'm saying that Miles was thrown under the bus because Anastasia knew she wasn't going to make it through this election. I'm saying that in the short time that he was in power, he tried to help with the cost of living. Which is a big cause to a lot of the other problems that QLD is dealing with. I'm pointing at the fact that the LNP hasn't shown that they have changed since they were last in power. They just sat back and let Labor dig their own grave. I'm all for change in parliament, for the right reason. But the LNP leadership doesn't give me confidence. Especially with how quiet they have been about their "plan."
6. So you‚Äôre disputing statistical facts. Literally from the first source on google. Finder is the website. Honestly baffling how some of you are so drawn to a political party as if it‚Äôs your entire identity. You must be deeply unhappy to base your whole personality on this if you‚Äôre getting this wound up over empirical data. Sky is blue as well. Happy to provide you a source on that if you need.
7. omg ur so right you got me so good ü§•ü§•ü§•
8. You don‚Äôt need permission to protest. Authorities have to get permission to _stop_ you protesting. The permit requirement is a notification, not a request.
9. They support Hamas and Hezbollah. LNP and ALP support the other terrorist group called Israel.
10. 100% - They may need to go have a cry over a latte!
11. Your original doesn't stand at all, I'm afraid. The LNP now government majority, a party where the majority overwhelmingly don't support healthcare for women. And as you say Katter is planning to put the bill forward, to a government we know doesn't support abortion. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/18/qld-election-2024-freya-ostapovitch-lnp-stretton-candidate-abortion-ntwnfb
12. You can't know that until a vote comes up. All Crisafulli had to say was the party would vote No on repeals/amendments and he couldnt.
13. Because the last time they allowed a conscience vote on the matter a few years back all but three LNP members voted against legalising abortion. If they vote the same way again, and the KAP members also back it, that will give them the numbers needed.
14. >‚ÄòI will work to repeal abortion laws but can‚Äôt say anything before election‚Äô: LNP candidate >‚ÄúYou vote for me, you trust me. I can‚Äôt say anything yet because we have got to get elected before we do anything,‚Äù she said in a conversation about abortion out the front of a pre-polling booth this week
15. It only became an issue because the LNP would not address it. All Crisafool had to do was say ‚Äúwe will not have a conscious vote on the matter, the LNP stands should-to-shoulder with women on their right to choice‚Äù - if he said this on day one of Katter raising it the whole thing would have gone away. KAP will raise a Bill, and LNP will have a conscious vote for members, and the Bill will pass. Crisafool will then step back and say it was all KAP and not LNP.
16. The lnp candidate from my electorate wants the laws changed.
17. We're talking about a party that wants to throw children into adult prisons and give them lifelong convictions and you still think they have the capacity to do what's morally right?
18. Katter might introduce it but it's the LNP conscience vote that will allow it to pass. This is entirely on the LNP they're just using KAP as scape goats
19. Time will tell but I have a very low bar for them, still remember Campbell Newman and that absolute disgrace of a party that was. Old mate here was in that circus so I am preparing for a buggering the next 4 years, I just hate that the major driving factor is seems is that we need a change for change sake. Make no real sense.
20. Go fuck yourself, the defintion of foetus is not baby. Grt the fuck out of women‚Äôs business, it‚Äôs nothing to do with you.
21. Jann Stuckey and Steve Minnikin, apparently. Given Tim Nicholls was the third person called out, I have a bit of confidence they may be the other two - that said, Hansard is incredibly poor for accessibility. It literally doesn‚Äôt work on mobile. October 17, 2018, apparently.
22. I feel an urge to use my tech skills to create a vote tracker now - at a federal level we have ‚Äútheyvoteforyou.org.au‚Äù but we have nothing at state level. I can‚Äôt can‚Äôt believe I had to resort to chatGPT coupled with ‚Äúand also provide link proof‚Äù
23. While youth crime does exist, the media is purposefully manufacturing a panic as if every suburb is terrorised by local youth gangs. It‚Äôs easy to propagandise using emotional personal recounts from victims when the numbers tell otherwise. Also, the whole ‚Äúadult crime adult time‚Äù is so brain dead. It doesn‚Äôt address the root causes of the problem and will just create more career criminals once these kids are perpetually in a cycle of recidivism since reintegrating back into society will be almost impossible. Just feels like Australians in general aren‚Äôt voting ‚Äúfor‚Äù something but just ‚Äúagainst‚Äù something. Literally asking any voters, be it LNP or ALP, on what they think the policies proposed by the party they support will help the working class and you‚Äôre just met with a blank stare or just talking points against the ‚Äúopponent‚Äù. Politics shouldn‚Äôt be a team sport üò≠
24. Where do you live? By most accounts it is a problem in the major regional centres like Cairns, Townsville and Rockhampton. The "actual statistics" at a total crime or entire state level can quite easily hide important details.
25. If the police know that the majority of crime is committed by a few kids in each area, why do they not target them specifically to eradicate the problem?
26. Youth/gang/brown people crime goes through the roof every time Labor is in power (well reporting on it does). The Libs will introduce an unethical ineffectual law, Murdoch stops the reporting and boomers are all happy again.
27. Interesting, I have a mate who is a senior cop that says it‚Äôs absolutely as bad as the media makes out.
28. It really depends where you live, some areas are fine, some are not. Labour has been a shit show on youth crime however. Not convinced LNP will do much better, but at least they won‚Äôt raise the age a juvenile turns into an adult as far as the criminal justice system in concerned, from 17 to 18. This was Labours biggest mistake, the upper ages represent the largest cohort of serious, recidivist child offenders. By doing this, they gave these ‚Äòkids,‚Äô another year of ‚Äòfree hits.‚Äô I say ‚Äòkids‚Äô loosely, as a six foot Pacific Islander threatening people with a Bowie knife isn‚Äôt what most people think of when they think of ‚Äòkids.‚Äô This obviously made the Stats for child offending go up, when ordinary these same individuals would have been captured in the adult crime stats. They really shit themselves in the foot.
29. * The total offences rate **decreased** by 6.7% * The rate of offences against the person **increased** by 4.8% * The rate of offences against property **decreased** by 7.8% * The rate of other offences **decreased** by 9.5% Less graffiti more stabbings. Less crime but
30. I‚Äôm a cop and it does exist. There are only a few really bad kids that don‚Äôt change but these ones still get bail after committing hundreds of burglaries. These specific kids shouldn‚Äôt get bail and should get rehabilitation whilst in remand. The fact is they don‚Äôt get rehabilitation until found guilty and the magistrates don‚Äôt find them guilty, just ‚Äòno further punishment‚Äô. I‚Äôd suggest your partner isn‚Äôt in GD‚Äôs or property crime?
31. Sorry. I disagree in saying it‚Äôs not a problem. It might not be where you reside but overall, it‚Äôs very much a problem.
32. You're right, it's not an issue. As long ad You're not related to the people being killed. The problem isn't how much crime young people (statistics can bring skewed if their not being caught and charged by the way) it's the types of crimes. That is escalating. The kid that stole a car and killed an entire family with it. wasn't a first offence either. That prick should be locked up for good. I guess the grandmother stabbed and killed at Redbank doesn't count because she lived at Rddbank? Anyway I guess if it hasn't affected you it's not happening.
33. Not an issue? Tell that to the people who are victims of repeat offenders. The police aren't the problem. It's the courts allowing rats to reoffend so often that going to court is just to collect a free sandwich and a complimentary crow bar at this point.
34. The thing is, it WAS out. Stats have clearly shown that youth crime isn't an issue. The LNP just made it one.
35. The trade off is governments are elected to govern, and they are entrusted to make decisions without being roadblock so much that government stagnates
36. That‚Äôs where, if we insist we cannot have an upper house since we‚Äôre such special snowflakes (it would require a referendum to reintroduce one - it‚Äôs double-entrenched in Queensland‚Äôs constitution), the least we could do is investigate (not even do, just investigate) proportional representation systems like MMP. The idea that you can say ‚Äúthis member represents my area the best, but I support this other party‚Äôs stances more‚Äù is pretty powerful.
37. Qld does not have a senate...there will be no obstruction to whatever they do.
38. I agree with four-year terms‚Ä¶ but not for an unbridled legislature.
39. Hopefully they're all conscious when they're voting, but who knows.
40. The Labor vote in 2018 was a *conscience* vote tho. And all but three LNP voters voted to keep abortion illegal. And only two of those are still in parliament, last i checked. If you re-ran that today as a conscience vote with a LNP majority, logic says that abortion would be made criminal again.
41. 100%. This isn't some uprising by local mum and dads. It's a targeted approach which is heavily funded. But that heavy funding has meant people like Scomo have been given permission to be vocally anti abortion. It's like when One Nation started and all the racists came out.
42. If only they cared enough about the child once it was born... or the mother.
43. Their are LNP members telling their voters they plan to change the abortion laws. They aren't even being subtle about it The only reason KAP is involved is because they said they would put the bill to parliament. Honestly, we owe them a thanks because judging by the LNPs' reaction, they were already planning on doing it. We just have prior warning now
44. We already teach nutrition, healthy sleep hygiene, respectful relationships - both within friendship groups and romantic partners, how to write a resume, driver's test preparation, how to conduct yourself at job interviews, how to plan and organise community events, create and market a product for sale, offer first aid courses, food studies, legal studies. Taxation and interest are covered in maths.... what other life skills are you looking for?
45. Debt =/= deficit. You can make money and still be in debt. Think about having a job and a mortgage at the same time.
46. Net debt was forecast to be 12.223 Billion dollars at the end of the 23-24 financial year. Then Miles came out and said they‚Äôd spent an extra 9 billion dollars by accident. So who knows what it really is. Point being, the state is already in debt.
47. The surplus was from borrowings. Below is from your link, look at the bottom and second bottom lines. Labor was playing us for mugs saying there was a real surplus. Its a bit like borrowing money to get a fancy car, not making any payments, and having some left at the end of the year. Then giving yourself a pat on the back for it. https://preview.redd.it/3wnx4g2wy8xd1.jpeg?width=1458&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78db8a371e013142670894ea01fe2780a6a66fac
48. It‚Äôs possible for a government to have a surplus and also be in debt.
49. The temporarily embarrassed millionaire class. Class consciousness is hard for some because they have to confront the reality they‚Äôre closer to being homeless than Elon musk
50. But yet QLD had to vote out the party who actually tried to do something about it? The party who put in policies that benefited a lot of people, including those struggling the most? Assistance with transport, bills and food are HUGE steps into reducing the cost of living pressure. With these gone, more of the population will feel the pinch. Like yes they can't solve the entire issue, but when has an LNP gov in Federal or State power done ANYTHING to help the overall population?
51. The thing is, certain tampering by the state government actually did contribute to a reduction in baseline inflation figures. Namely, energy bill relief and reduction in rego and transport prices. I‚Äôm not suggesting that as a result of the LNP probably gutting all of the above that the RBA is going to gleefully hike rates - but it‚Äôs not impossible.
52. 50c public transport, Energy rebates, and discounted Registration certainly help.
53. IDK, they were certainly doing something. The rebates can mean an awful lot to a struggling household. And housing is pretty significantly controlled by the state. I don't think it's fair to just put it all down to interest rates and federal stuff.
54. Indeed. Telling people their personal experience didn't happen means that person will not vote for you. You obviously will not help them with their problem because you told them it's not real or called them names. Welcome to opposition Life. It ends when you stop insulting potential supporters
55. There is a big problem I have with that though: LNP‚Äôs whole campaign is ‚ÄúAdult Crime, Adult Time‚Äù. Alright, please define ‚ÄúAdult‚Äù in both those places. While I heard an LNP volunteer try to do so at a polling place, and good on him for trying to do that, the issue is that at the policy platform level, it‚Äôs a questionmark. Well, really, that‚Äôs the entire LNP policy platform. I don‚Äôt like the LNP. I put them last. But I would be a lot more comfortable (though I recognise others wouldn‚Äôt be) if they were just honest and transparent. This campaign, my feeling is they have not been. The whole pitch was ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not Labor‚Äù - precisely so these slogans can be interpreted however the reader wants, regardless of reality. You‚Äôve also talked about ‚Äúvictims of crime‚Äù. You do realise how nebulous that is, right? And how even you did not say ‚Äúvictims of _youth_ crime?‚Äù
56. Well I can't imagine crime getting any better if the LNP repeat history and sack thousands of public servants including police. No policies to address the root issues, and planned decisions to scrap services that would have a direct and long lasting reduction on crime. What a shame. I hope QLD voters who voted the LNP enjoy higher crime rates, higher taxes, less public services, longer waits in hospitals, paying for ambulances and more cars on the road (last one also comes with increased demand and cost for fuel too!)
57. \> 46% of people had been a victim of crime in the past year or directly **knew someone** that had been. What kind of data point is that? The only way to phrase a category in that way is to attempt to distort the numbers to suit a narrative. No one is saying that youth crime is down across the board. But the data shows that, over a 10-year period, it's been decreasing. And for most types of crimes there's been a drop. But newspapers, media and the LNP colluded to brand this as a "youth crime epidemic", which is a gross exaggeration intended to get an emotional reaction from voters. No one has been able to point to specific crime numbers over time that justifies the beat up that happened. It's either cherry picked numbers or personal anecdotes. The most damning Courier Mails numbers - which they branded an epidemic - was to say "offender rate increased from 1863 offenders per 100,000 people to 1925" over a one-year period. Thats a 5% change. Every LNP voter who has responded on this thread has used the excuse that their personal opinion about crime is more valid than the actual data. This is the kind of bullshit that has infested US politics, and we should absolutely be calling out. There was similar US-style sketchiness from Labor in this cycle too, which shouldn't be rewarded.
58. >Labor‚Äôs response that crime had decreased is disingenuous though and that‚Äôs the problem. It‚Äôs not down, it‚Äôs down in some areas, but it‚Äôs up significantly in assaults, b&e and motor theft relative to the previous 4 years. It's down per total population, do you have data on which areas have had it increased?
59. >You can try and target poor kids at risk before they turn to crime Innocent until proven guilty, amirite? This just leads to "They're treating me like a fucking criminal anyways, I may as well act the part".
60. I‚Äôd just like to add my 2 cents as a victim of domestic violence who was was held captive and severely abused, and unhappy with the outcome from the judicial system. Not the same as youth crime but still a victim of violent crime, and my thoughts can be expanded to all types of crime. My abuser was sent away for 8 months. While in prison he was using his flying monkeys to contact me and try to get me to call him. When he left prison he‚Äôs tried to contact me multiple times. I do not feel safer in a punitive justice system, where they throw people like my abuser away to fester and become worse people. I would feel a lot more comfortable with the 8 month sentence if rehabilitation and restorative justice were implementations for prisons. But it‚Äôs not like that. Because why do policies proven to reduce recidivism and reduce crime when the prisons can just leech money by keeping as many beds full as possible. Money is much more important apparently than actually creating a safer, more just society. In countries with rehabilitative and restorative justice policies, recidivism rates are 20% for a 5 year period, in comparison to Australia where our recidivism rate is 55% for the same time period. More than half the people in prison now will re-enter prison. How can people still rail for punitive justice when it‚Äôs doing the opposite of what they claim to want, a safer society.
61. > For some of them, their actions are extreme enough that they need to be separated from society, regardless of how sad their upbringing is. The challenge is how do you do it in away that rehabilitates rather than just punishes. You‚Äôve inadvertently stumbled onto the entire point. The criminal system is _not_ the best way to rehabilitate. Convictions last a _really_ long time and you can‚Äôt even get a job at Macca‚Äôs without a background check. Trust me, I know, I‚Äôve done shit I‚Äôm not proud of but the magistrate‚Äôs decision not to record has been invaluable to making sure I can maintain a decent career and not repeat my mistakes. ‚ÄúAdult crime, adult time‚Äù is the opposite of this. Rehabilitation shouldn‚Äôt be the goal, _prevention_ should be. The government has a lot of departments, and it‚Äôs appalling that QPS is apparently the first-line one. There‚Äôs even one with ‚Äúchild‚Äù in its name, and still it‚Äôs blind until everything has already gone to custard. (And, by the way, the fact this is downvoted appalls me. It turns out that /r/brisbane is all about putting kids in jail and fucking up their lives instead of actually coming up with real solutions. Fuck you. I mean it, you are actual scum. Fuck you.)
62. And this is all I‚Äôm saying- you‚Äôve put it more eloquently than me.
63. I'm not delegitimizing anything, nor am I saying to blindly trust the process. I don't think you and the other gentleman are understanding that... I'm actually advocating for a better system, but what Queensland just voted for is not a better system. It just isn't and history shows that. We've had "tough on crime" policies in the past and they've universally ended in worse outcomes for young offenders AND communities. Crisafulli hasn't said anything about addressing the staggering levels of poverty that exist in some of these communities, or social programs to help struggling families that are in poverty. Until Crisafulli addresses these issues, his populist policies will not deliver anything, it won't deliver justice to victims and communities. And it won't deliver rehabilitated offenders that have broken the cycle.
64. Not once have I made excuses. And it's getting frustrating having people say that ALL the time simply because I don't blindly follow the "throw children into adult prisons" narrative. And you're correct punishing crime and treating poverty doesn't have to be mutually exclusive. But that's exactly what the LNP is doing. They aren't interested in the poverty side of and its inherent link to crime. You can't solve the crime side of things without addressing the poverty side of it. As a result communities will continue to experience crime when they do t have to. Children don't know right from wrong, especially children who've only ever known a life of poverty and crime. Which again, addressing that side of it will go a long way to preventing the offending side of it.
65. Ok elevate the attempted murder charge to the murder charge and guess what.. they'll finish the job next time. Why not? Dead guy can't testify! America is the living model for this.
66. So since QCS spends over 90k per year per prisoner, you'd prefer to be sending your tax dollars toward locking up these kids instead of using that money to maybe deal with the poverty, domestic violence, mental health and other failures of our society? You seriously think these kids prefer crime and jail over help?
67. Singapore also focused on reducing poverty and raising literacy rates and provided housing for all.
68. Singapore is a poor example. Median income increased by 40% over 10 years, which adjusted for inflation, is a growth of 2% every year. 1 in 10 households exist in poverty in Singapore, however this stat is massively inflated by foreign workers under cheaper labour taking blue collar jobs. https://borgenproject.org/poverty-singapore/ It's also interesting to note that in 2022, physical crime increased, but wasnt instigated by necessity of poverty. these were crimes for Modesty, Voyeurism, and Molestation
69. We never said Debbie's didn't exist... Just said the amount of them was drastically exaggerated by the media... If people were saying it, it was a minority of them ü§∑
70. That‚Äôs just so deeply painful. I know TUH has a ridiculous amount of aged patients boarding, waiting for care. I sincerely hope you can get assistance before your hand is forced. Keep on them.
71. And the LNP privatising ambulances and not putting money into expanding hospitals or health services will help that how
72. Hospitals are still recovering from when they gutted them last time.
73. What pisses me off is people pretending like TIMING isn't a huge issue depending on where you happen to be in your life. If the LNP manages to BAN abortion for the next 4 years, that can absolute destory someone's life. It doesn't matter for them that it eventually gets over turned.
74. Oh but wait - mining royalties are out now with LNP in.... government can't fund all the other initiatives without it so will be interesting to see what stays....
75. Ah, another conservative who only gives a fuck about themselves. Fuck off. I am so sick of your kind. You just fuck everyone over because it's all about you. Get. Right. Fucked.
76. And he‚Äôs going to fund that without mining royalties _how_ exactly? Their platform _requires_ razor gangs to work.
77. Great way to show you lack critical thinking skills hasn‚Äôt the debate talked about the disproportionate impact on marginalised communities
78. Calling a disabled woman "ridiculously over dramatic" about her very legitimate fears and concerns regarding her own health and wellbeing. That's the way mate, good one üëç
79. People said the same thing before Campbell Newman fucked us for decades. I‚Äôm not buying what you‚Äôre selling.
80. it's really sad that you think community and solidarity are worth nothing. rallies aren't enough as a political tool, rallies alone don't achieve change. but they are important for morale. i feel like your anger and frustration is really misplaced towards protestors and I'd be curious to know why
