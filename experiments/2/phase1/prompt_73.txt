Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. "Adult crime, adult time" would be a fucked primary policy platform even if the state *was* experiencing elevated levels of youth crime Blatantly exploiting and encouraging fear, ignorance and divisiveness in order to win power - fuck every cunt who participates in this
2. Data always gets misused to suit the wanted narrative. It's a pity journalists don't highlight this more often.
3. What's really rich is Crisafulli just today [walked back his promise to resign if victim numbers don't go down.](https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/crisafulli-walks-back-key-crime-commitment-on-election-eve-20241025-p5kldd.html) > The opposition leader added a significant caveat to his earlier promise to resign if victim numbers don't go down in an LNP government's first term, saying the statistics would be adjusted for population growth. > "It will be tied to population growth, of course," he told reporters on the Sunshine Coast on Friday. > "As a population expands, it's commensurate. You want less victims as a ratio of your population." I guess he prefers population-based statistics when it comes to his own career.
4. It's all a game. Politics is not a contest of ideas, it is a contest of vested interests with the politicians being pawns pushing their given agendas. I've met people that work in the offices, it's all 'the greater good' excuses for the morally bankrupt stuff they get up to, and the media orgs are not in a great place at the moment so they will just take what ever is given to them and regurgitate it to fill columns and air-time. It's nobodies fault, it's just the structure of the system we live in where money controls everything.
5. I mean its not like youth crime, particularly brazen robberies, home invasions and wild motor vehicle theft doesnt exist. Doesnt help that these kids are now targetting previously affluent suburbs plus posting it on line The actual numbers of crime might be the same, it might be lower but Even if it was just a handful of kids youd want some sort of government intervention
6. Media like the ABC are complacent in this. The QLD have been doing this for longer than the election cycle, and it's only really been in the last two weeks that any pressure has been put on Crisafulli to back up his claims. Instead, Media gave him a platform at the Prime evening news hours to stand their, using victims of crime as political props so that he could deceive the people of Queensland.
7. https://www.qgso.qld.gov.au/issues/7856/crime-report-qld-2022-23.pdf there the raw numbers 225 pages worth without any news bias. It was pretty sad reading. Most crimes had increased, some stay the same not many, went down. They justified the youth crime numbers by saying they had more enforcement. anyone have the 23-24 one? also interesting the public data on crime goes from 2001 to 22. can't access 23,24 but maybe that's normal. edit: quote from the paper. >Total number of child offenders proceeded against by police increased by 8.6% and the number of unique child offenders by 5.2% (+557 individuals) compared with 2021–22. • Young female unique offenders increased by 10.3%. • Child offenders were twice as likely as adult offenders to be proceeded against by police for property offences.
8. And they publish this at 5:15pm, Fri evening before polls open. ABC is just openly pulling the piss now. When Abbott appointed buttrose, that was the beginning of the newscorpse-ing of ABC, and things have only gotten more toxic since then. Pains me to say, ABC is fcked and beyond repair or redemption. The ABC of our youth, the ABC as the lifeline to rural Australians is no more. Uncle rupert has won that war. So as far as I can see, we no longer have a genuine non bias national broadcaster.

10. Sad that qld is full of so many cookers now.
11. At the end of the day this will be Labor's downfall especially in Logan and Ipswich. They should have been building more youth detention centres or even announcing the wellcamp as a detention centre as well. A lot of these youth needed to do time and that in turn would have reduced the pressure on the education system to act as their watchers rather than educators
12. Wait what. We had a youth crime narrative in NZ too that led to the election of a right leaning government.
13. Only speaking out now doesn’t really make the case for not wanting to defund the ABC. They have to do better
14. Oh good. We were running short on dorky political posts.
15. Apart from the editorialised headline, how is this about Brisbane as per rule 1?
16. Kenji (the journalist who wrote this story) has been covering this topic for 12 months. Here’s a story from September last year: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-30/queensland-youth-crime-long-term-data-downward-abs-police/102917994 Here’s a story from October last year: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-10-13/queensland-historical-media-reports-crime-waves-youth-crime/102957034 Here’s a story from six months ago: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-22/queensland-violence-on-rise-report-shows-not-just-youth-crime/103751192 Here’s a story from two weeks ago: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-13/criminologists-debunk-youth-crime-crisis-claims/104445432
17. It was there but largely ignored. The bipartisan youth crime committee fell apart back in April because of it - they recommended regulations on media reporting misinforming the public about the nonexistent youth crime epidemic to stop youths being ostracised and demonised ironically leading to crime. As soon as they came out with that though the LNP dropped their support for the youth crime committee they so desperately demanded last year. They don't want their bullshit to be fact checked and want to continue to lie to the public.
18. It’s pathetic isn’t it. Just lip service to say that they’d been fair and equitable.
19. Fucking ironic when this sub does it all the time the other way. 'Less kids are committing crime' Sure but the ones committing crime are committing 10x more and escalate in seriousness earlier to take advantage of low repercussions 'But crime has gone down' Call 131 444 and tell me how long you wait on hold Have crime reporting rates gone down or up?
20. Yeah are they gonna start throwing 13yo kids in adult prisons??
21. I'm just curious what they think "adult time" means. The most "adult" crimes of all, those are committed almost exclusively by adults and never by children, are things like embezzlement, fraud, insider trading, insolvent trading (I wonder who did this one, hmmm), and so on. And the "adult time" that most offenders get for these is pitiful. So is their policy to give youth criminals *no* time, just like the perpetrators of the most "adult" crimes?
22. > "Adult crime, adult time" What's even more fucked is that it's literal fascist rhetoric, the billboards with it splayed across and Crisafulli in the corner looking all "heroic" would give Mussolini a heart attack with how blatant it is.
23. I wonder if abortion will be considered an adult crime when they recriminalise it
24. There's no such thing as journalism anymore. They can't even spell check the stuff they copy-paste.
25. I’d prefer they use ratios rather than total numbers, as it gives a fairer view in my opinion. I do not believe harsher punishment will deliver less victims. Short, medium or long term. I’m no expert but as I understand it, markedly more policing may get an uplift in these kinds of things the short term. However only social policy reform will shift the dial in the long term.
26. If you’d recently been a victim of youth crime, as I have, you’d stop downplaying it. Have a sense of common decency for victims of youth crime and stop using it to push your political agenda.
27. Cheers. Looks like crime decreased in south east Queensland over the previous 10 years, but increased in other regions.
28. Kenji Sato has been reporting on this issue [throughout the campaign](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-13/criminologists-debunk-youth-crime-crisis-claims/104445432) and [for many months prior.](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=454772507211483)
29. 100%.\ Ita really needs to be removed for the hood of the ABC and Australia.
30. Mate the current youth detention centers are badly under staffed, so where do you think they are going to find the staff for the other new centres that you want to build? It is never that simple
31. it's interesting that his articles are misusing data to make a narrative. here a quote from 21-22 report, that was being used for data (I posted 22-23 one earlier) >Queensland Police Service recorded 64,540 victims of offences against the person in 2021–22, a 49.2% increase on the previous year (43,260 recorded victims in 2020–21) (Figure 22). This has seen the total number of recorded victims more than double over the past ten years, from 28,012 in 2012–13, with the two most recent years accounting for a combined 79.6% of the total increase another quote >Both the count and rate of unique victims of personal offences reached a 10-year high in 2021–22 another >Child offenders comprised over half of all offenders proceeded against for unlawful use of motor vehicle, robbery, and unlawful entry in 2021–22. cherry picking the low offender numbers but not mentioning that there are more unique victims isn't right. People are worried about being a victim of crime, and the data is saying you are statistically more likely to be a victim of crime now than you were 10 years ago.
32. [The ABC has pushed back](https://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/1gbp08i/abc_brisbane_how_politicians_and_the_media_misuse/ltnw2ta/), but the people who need to hear it are probably anti-ABC, by design.
33. People just want to bury their heads in the sand. Right wingers harp on the fact that crime is up to an almost annoying degree (regardless, crime is at an all time high) so leftists just recorrect way too hard and say the issue is fake and doesn't exist. Classic you go high we go low.
34. Almost like there might be a middle ground between doing nothing each time they appear in court and incarceration in an adult prison
35. Go check out r/Australian if you want honest answers to that...
36. They want to repeal the three strikes drug laws but still want their three strikes on white collar crime.
37. I drove out to Ipswich and they had that billboard just past Wacol which made me chuckle but also made me sad.
38. Let's be honest, it's mostly on one side of the political spectrum that blatantly lies about shit and stokes fear to get elected because they know their policies won't do it.
39. Man you must be ropeable at Chrisafulli using your circumstance for his own politcal agenda then.
40. no place had a decrease of crime rate (crime per 100 000) even Brisbane south and Brisbane north had a 30% increase, outback and Townsville with near 50%. Was surprised at Brisbane west staying stable (note, this is all crime not just youth). ~~the other interesting thing was that there is half as many unique youth offenders but they are committing twice as many crimes as 9 years ago. so basically they are committing 4 times as much crime per youth. Which suggest whatever solutions we have aren't working.~~ misreading a date on one of the pages. There is still as many unique youth offenders but they are still committing more crime per youth. Page 52. >Furthermore, there has been a notable increase in the average number of offences per unique offender actioned by police compared with ten years prior, more so for child offenders (+44.4%, from 2.7 to 3.9) but also for adults (+22.7%, 2.2 to 2.7).
41. Ita Buttrose hasn't been chair of the ABC since March.
42. Ita is gone but as far as I know, another X newcorps stooge got the spot
43. They will find staff - no different to the police recruiting. Look first at private security personnel
44. They changed the way they reported domestic violence in July 2021 resulting in a big jump in the figures. [https://www.qgso.qld.gov.au/issues/7856/crime-report-qld-2021-22.pdf](https://www.qgso.qld.gov.au/issues/7856/crime-report-qld-2021-22.pdf)
45. “It’s a health issue that can become a crime issue”, he said, ignoring both health and crime experts.
46. And every rational person knows which side it is, and yet the people on that side will nod thinking it's the other one lol
47. On the contrary I’m tired of people like you downplaying the issue.
48. Shows the level of care I felt for the good old ABC once she was installed as emperor. She just screwed it sideways from day one. And it’s gonna need some serious none LNP leadership to fix it up.
49. So we should pay youth detention workers 90 grand out of the gate? And privatisation of corrections is a terrible, terrible idea
50. **Unique** victims, sections 7.0 Total unique victims from 36,962 to 52,202 increase of 41.2% >Analyses were conducted on selected recorded offences data and, while the analysis below indicates a significant increase in recorded assault offences in particular since the practice change was implemented, it is difficult to quantify how much of the observed increase in this and other DFV–related offences can be attributed to this change alone. that from 1.2 So they themselves couldn't quantify how much it changed.
51. And we are tired of people like you exaggerating the issue.
52. Might not have such a recruitment problem soon with the rising unemployment
53. We, who is “we”? You victim-blaming piece of trash. I really hope you don’t have to have go through what my family did. Have some compassion you hurtful person. Or were you one of these people when you were younger?
54. have some logic, lashing out at all children and lying about statistics because you are the victim of one crime is hurtful to literally every child that isn't the one that hurt you. someone disagrees with you and you start name calling and assuming i was a criminal, and then say i need compassion? you are cooked.
55. Well you're talking about that there is no one to recruit but that will be solved fairly soon when there are more people looking for work when unemployment inevitably keeps rising
56. You disagree with a victim. Yeah you are part of the problem.
57. Well if they criminalise abortion and drug possession the crime rate is just going to go up
58. Crisafulli = Campbell Newman 2.0 Crisafulli has been fearmongering on "Youth Crime" for the past fours years as Opposition Leader, and his whole election campaign is based on his signature "Youth Crime" policy, where he promised to resign as Premier if the rate didn't decrease. They are backflipping on their flagship policy **before** the election. Crisafulli and the LNP will criminalise Abortion and dismantle Women's reproductive healthcare rights, with jubilation.
59. Maybe he realised his stupid ‘adult crime adult time’ and his ‘make QLD great again’ esk vibe is actually going to create more victims because instead of rehabilitating and therapeutically supporting people of offend so they actually deter from a life of crime, it will just made it worse. This man is a joke and I can’t believe we are at this point where there is a chance he’ll be Premier.
60. Headline assumes he'll get in. Queensland needs to make sure he doesn't.
61. It is fucking hilarious that the reason he has had to walk this back is because the crime rate is so low that a small population change might negate the effect of their policies.
62. How did anyone accept this would happen? Only a fkn moron would have believed he will resign if crime doesn’t go down.
63. Even if he does get elected, how many sound bites has he created for himself to run as political advising against him.
64. I wouldn't trust the LNP to run a bath let alone the state.
65. https://preview.redd.it/x28ohmvlktwd1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9fb6fe8db9bc1f5005463a7e13635d3fee11fad Also weird, isn’t there meant to be a news media blackout?
66. And if Queenslanders still choose this arsehole then they deserve him. Source. A Queenslander.
67. I guess that exposes the obvious, crime isn't up at all, and there will still be victims if the government changes.
68. Slippery fish to put it mildly. Deceitful cunt would be apt according to some
69. Well he’ll let it go up first so when it drops by a single percent (after sacking a whole bunch of cops so they aren’t recording the data that converts into the statistics) he can sing and float about how great he is.
70. My God this man's bloated and impacted with fecal matter!
71. Is this on population - that isn't that unreasonable given our population boom and no doubt more people would come to Qld if Labor wasn't in power
72. I think you mean revised not broken. It’s hard to break a promise to resign from a role under certain conditions if you haven’t been appointed yet.
73. He realised it a day before the election lol. Dearie me. Also I’ll edit with a link, but Murdoch media is so angry at him that even sky news is turning on him. https://preview.redd.it/15whuvcfstwd1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bbd7f58314efcf26489f03708991d900104b40d Edit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/friendlyjordies/s/3oqZQMfqG5](https://www.reddit.com/r/friendlyjordies/s/3oqZQMfqG5)
74. But if they legalise it there will be more babies aborted, which means lower population, which means the crime rate per capita will go up.
75. Watching FTA TV few years ago. Every time Crisafulli comes up on the News he just says the opposite of Labor. When I harass liberal boomers voters on facebook, they have zero, I mean ZERO understanding of LNP policies. They think they are voting on a another version of Labor. In the context of Labor building 50 new GP clinics, they cannot separate state and federal government. Quizzing them on free market principals, and I paraphrase myself, ' that if you are waiting two weeks for a appointment to the GP, to capitalise on demand and the Doctors can turn a bigger profit. You (to the LNP voter) would have no problem for a doctor to paying 800 dollars per visit for a shorter waiting times as per LNP policies; LNP will not build clinics' All I got "LABOR BAD HURR HURR" response.
76. They already knew it would create more victims because of what Newman did in 2012. They just don't care.
77. What has he done with the vibe of Esk 😩
78. Do you mean political advertising blackout? pretty sure media can still report on the election
79. The blackout only applies to broadcast media. It doesn't apply to print media and online services.
80. No an advertising blackout. Although I’m still getting ALP ads in my The Australian podcast.
81. I don’t. It’s an election promise and it is a day before the election closes. Hundreds of thousands of QLDers have already cast their vote.
82. Maybe but the fact remains, he made a dumb soundbite promise to get votes but which never had any substance, that the right - wing media amplified, and now he's quietly walking away from it.
83. With this great advice, I am considering revising my wedding vows.
84. More likely they'll privatise the ones we have then overcrowd them.
85. Jesus imagine falling out of favour with Murdoch in a state where every paper is Murdoch owned. I'd say the chance of a leadership spill regardless of whether they win is pretty likely
86. Donors need to get to build prisons and get their other (hidden) promises.
87. They care, because it generates political targets in the future. What else does a party do to make sure people can't fix the problems they're making money from? Housing, fair work, welfare, taxes, etc. So make sure the party who might actually have these goals are instead needing to put more resources into problems the other party manifests.
88. I’m not mad at him. I don’t believe anything he says. Not my problem. It’s the problem of those who trust him and he fails to deliver. That’s on them.
89. No, it's a news media blackout too but only applies to broadcasting media like network TV, not digital media or social media.
90. Oh you might be right. I’m super interested in politics so I’m happy but I’m sure lots of people were looking forward to the break in political content. Oh well 29 hours to go!
91. Is it quiet if it’s in the media like the original comment?
92. For it to be the same you’d have to not be married
93. Only because he ran out of time and wanted to privatise ambos first
94. That’s so strange to me, but thanks for explaining your perspective.
95. Miles is going super hard on social media right now
96. Thanks for clarification. This rule probably needs to be reviewed as it seems antiquated with internet revolution
97. Ah. That’s why my non-adblocked YouTube app kept getting LNP propaganda this morning…
98. … if the Lying Nasty Party receive a majority, for example, we’ll all not receive any break.
99. It's quiet if it isn't all over the Murdoch media and not just in the Guardian. Unless LNP voters can read it in the Courier Mail, or see it on Sky News, it's invisible to them.
100. I believe so but not sure, though usually there's a tonne of workarounds with anything when it comes to unsolicited calls and messages because usually the information is obtained via some sort of agreement the individual documented had online that they totally didn't know about.
101. I get them when I forget to take my meds.
102. You can mute the sub and then unmute it after the election. I think you will still receive reply notifications though.
103. Not being angry at a politician for making a promise that he had no intention of following through on. You’re here often enough to be well informed, you know that there are plenty of people in QLD of different levels of political comprehension - people like my 65 year old nurse mum who hasn’t got a clue about any of them nor the familiarity with technology to competently fact check things - and who also believe in the good of people and are somewhat naive. Why on earth would you be mad at them for believing what this doe eyed man says? Why wouldn’t you be angry at the wolf in sheep’s clothing? Edit: though thanks to her daughter’s - my mum isn’t actually voting for the LNP.
104. Me being angry doesn’t achieve anything. Just be old man (not that old) yells at clouds ☁️. I lament at the stupidity of people in our country. Since Trump and Covid, we have a massive amount of people who are now incredibly stupid. These party’s prey on these vulnerable people. There are always less of them, but with preferences, they can be elected. Same as in the USA. Trump was elected after gaining less votes, because it’s set up to help conservatives. I’m not angry. It’s got nothing to do with me. My vote only counts for one vote. For some reason, many people think their voice counts for more. I can only be content with my vote.
105. Thanks again for explaining, I was misunderstanding your tone over text 👍🏼
106. He has also walked back "resigning" if crime numbers don't go down https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/25/queensland-election-david-crisafulli-lnp-crime-numbers-policy
107. I'm incredibly sorry for what happened to Russell Field's son, wife and unborn child but I think he is still way too emotional about what happened to be as effective as he needs to be. Also this seems to be his only issue and has no other policy to speak of..
108. Where can I find the LNP costings? You’d think they’d put them on their website!
109. # Staff shortages could derail LNP's youth detention reform plans, Queensland criminology professor says >In short: >If elected, the Liberal National Party promises to conduct youth detention reforms, including mandating education and isolating children who use violence. >A recent Queensland Ombudsman report on a Queensland youth detention centre has found children can not access education and are locked in cells when there are not enough staff.... A Queensland Liberal National Party plan to reform youth detention has been met with doubt as the sector struggles with staff shortages.
110. Correct. The LNP's policies over the last 15+ years in particular have always been based on ideology. Most galling to me is the way they've been parading victims of crime around, as if their populist based crime policies are going to deliver justice to these people. And of course these people, Russell Field especially are far too angry and grief stricken to realize they've been taken advantage of. The populist policies of the LNP are not going to deliver these people justice. Populism isn't designed to help the people, it's designed to get politicians elected based on emotion. But as I've said before, angry voters are stupid voters 🤷
111. AS THEY HAVE BEEN SINCE THE PARTY STARTED. No one gets to be surprised by conservatives any more. If you didn't know, you were intentionally misleading yourself. This is your fault.
112. Bit like Abbott in 2013 with stop the boats but it worked
113. Did OP make up the post title or did the ABC change the article headline? Also based on this article it looks like CYDC has a staffing issue that Labor has been unable to fix. Not exactly a ringing endorsement.

115. The political component of this sub is 100% based on emotion 😆
116. Spoiler alert: All political parties rely on emotional hype leading into elections. It's what gets votes.
