Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Let me be blunt. I absolutely will not say the criminal justice system shouldn’t play a part. The reality is that other agencies, if they stepped in sooner, with more support, could _prevent_ crime. That should be the goal. Prevention is 1000% better than rehabilitation. I have a problem with “Adult crime, adult time” because it’s undefined. But I don’t care who’s in charge as long as their youth crime focus is more about prevention rather than rehabilitation. I’m pessimistic that the LNP will even _think_ about it, but I sent DC my thoughts on it anyway. His speech said he would put Queenslanders interests first, so I told him that while I did not vote for him, I hope he sticks to that claim. (People who downvoted this: fuck you. You deserve to be victims of crime, because you have no decency. You think that instead of helping kids to not become criminals in the first place, we should indoctrinate them into a criminal justice system that fucks them up for life. Fuck you. Hard.)
2. They are going to sell all the public hospitals calling it now
3. Yeah, I know we've been drifting that way for a while.. but it's really gutted me lately. "Fuck you, I got mine". We might as well make it the national anthem at this point.
4. BRB, forgot to pull my ladder up behind me :(
5. Murdoch and stokes have blood in the game. Billions in shares. They also tell you what to think. And dumbshits listen.
6. This isn’t about race so calm down you believe in Adult Crime Adult time locking kids up? Some of us don’t race irrelevant these are children
7. Of course. Your feelings, fears and worries are totally valid and many of us are feeling the same way ❤️
8. > What age do you think we live in that this would ever happen in Australia? The age where we just elected an extremely regressive, religious party to government in a state where we have no Upper House to keep them in check.
9. My bad for assuming, but no need to shit talk me when I'm on your side 😊
10. What indicated I dont know? I know enough to say it was never on the table for the LNP, nor was it brought up by them. At this point seems like you're guessing a whole lot more than me. I certainly wouldn't support changing our current laws, but neither does it seem worthy of a protest.. protest what? Our current law.. its stupid.
11. If you re-read the comment it’s referring to the period before the Labor changes. Had first hand experience with a medically required termination with my partner, no one went to jail, nor raised any issues with legalities…
12. I refuse to believe there is more than 10% of people who believe its in society best interest to take away those rights. Regardless of political leaning..
13. I actually didn't care if Labor or LNP won. Fyck the Greens. I quite liked Miles and had money on him to win. So try again..
14. The issue is that the cost wasn’t worked out properly - they only costed out the food. There were major issues with who would actually work in the school to hand out the food, given so many mums go back to work now and there isn’t that free labour any more. And how would the food be supplied to remote regions? It sounds like a great idea on the surface, but it’s not been thought out to the degree that it needs to in order to work.
15. > what possible issue could there be with giving kids lunch ffs? I don’t have an issue with free lunches. I think it implemented well could actually help disadvantaged kids who aren’t getting fed get ahead. Youth crime is not increasing at the rate the media is making it out to be, there is plenty of data on that already. Youth crime in general is a long term issue that requires a long term approach that might not solve it for the current generation of underaged kids committing crimes but it might help the next one. Providing food for those kids who’s parents can’t feed for whatever reason is one step closer to improving their quality of life. It also creates jobs for those in the catering industry to make food for kids. I don’t know what the LNP and Katter voters have against kids but they sure seem to want to lock them up while at the same time force unwanted pregnancies to create more kids the run through the system. Are these political parties being paid off by corporations like SERCO and G4S? Is this another prison industrial complex like the US and UK have been profiting off of for the last few decades?
16. Both those sets of problems can exist at the same time, be of concern at the same time, and need community measures at the same time. It’s not a contest. I know these problems existed long before we had at-home visibility, I was finding needles in my garden in inner Sydney thirty years ago. But for me personally, as someone decades married to a consistently non-violent man, I am much more likely to be a victim of crime from the local youth delinquents, and I’m not going to apologise for thinking that’s a problem I’d like addressed (although I agree that LNP aren’t necessarily bringing much to the table with evidentiary support at this stage).
17. I’m in Moreton Bay and we have more crime here and it’s to a higher degree. Somebody was stabbed to death in their house by teens only a suburb away. A house was set on fire in the next street. Teens are roaming the streets at night looking for cars and houses to break into. It is real.
18. What about the men who are treated the same by woman. This is not to dispute what you say. 100% true everything you have said. But it’s not just a black or white issue either. Crime is not race oriented. You can be any colour, religious faith, any sex or gender, any ethnicity. If you are a born human then you fall into the category. Why can’t people just get along. Why do we need to be better than the person standing next to us. There will always be crime. Murder, rape, theft, the list goes on and on. No matter what planet anyone or anything lives on. Should it hell no, can we change it, absolutely hell no. So how do we fix it. I’m guessing is to end our human race but that dosent fix the dogs or cats or bears or any other animal that’s walks this planet or any planet. Does it affect us yes. Can we live with it. I guess we’ll have too. Should we cloud the fact that it exists hell no.
19. Absolutely they are rendered useless. Just ask the police dealing with this stuff everyday and night. And 100% not all youth are in this category. It’s like saying all lawyers are blood sucking parasites, but in reality they are not. Even the age old police are assholes. Clearly they are not, they just people trying to do a job. A job that everyone hates them for until they are the subject of crime. Then all the sudden they are the first person anyone rings. Tbh it’s a thankless job and for anyone involved in their lives. Bullying, harassment, reticule. choosing certain friends because no one wants to be seen to be friends with police. In reality they are people just trying to make a difference in this messed up country of ours. Like youth workers, doctors nurses, plumbers and builders and every other hard working Aussie is just trying to survive this country. It’s not all doom and gloom I’m proud to say I’m seventh generation Aussie. I love this country. It saddens me to see how fellow Aussie no matter what race, religion, colour or beliefs are too ignorant to see the problems in the real world and to believe what a poll tells them as gospel. To stand up against the powers that be that claim to be fixing our country. Why can’t a nobody be elected for prime minister. Someone who is actually living in the real world and dealing with real world problems because nobody would like what they said, that’s why. We have to be seen to be a thriving and prosperous nation so we look good. Dont get me wrong, its not just our country it’s a global problem. And we can’t change the world. But I would like to change my backyard
20. It would be nice to live under a rock. And as for the numbers. It’s easy to say when you only write down what they want you to see. And yes I do know personally first hand how the numbers are made up. Don’t look at the media actually go and live in these places and see it first hand. And to clarify it’s not the police. They are just as fed up with it as the the rest of us that deal with it on a day to day basis. If it’s not a problem then why are groups of people dealing with them themselves. There is no end to it because they know they can’t be touched. I truly hope that one day the comman person will see the actual reality of the world, unfortunately most of you live in a nice estate in the city and don’t have to deal with the real world.
21. I'm not even going to touch most of that nonsense but I'll stick to what I referenced originally: I'll 100 percent call out when people give anecdotal experiences some huge social value. Youth crime and crime on the whole is going down and has been for a while. In no world should that be a major issue at the polls.
22. The irony. How about you come out of your echo chamber? https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/100936
23. It’s just gross how American organisations get their mitts into everything that *should* have nothing to do with them.
24. That's even funnier. But yeah, I recall the whole meeting was covertly filmed.
25. He sourced them from here. Important to remember these stats don’t account for population increases. They’re simply numbers, not data analysis. https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/queensland-crime-statistics/
26. I understand and agree for the need for increased prevention effort. An ounce of prevention worth a pound of cure etc etc. Get no argument from me. But what about now? And what about the cases where the "prevention" doesn't work? People clearly (as evidenced by this election) aren't happy to have the legal system just give out slaps on the wrists. How many times does a person need to be in front of a judge, be shown the impact the crime has done the victims, pledge to be better and not commit crimes again, then go out and do it all over again? I don't think anyone would be against having leniency for first time offenders, but when you read some cases where the kids are committing dozens of crimes, how can the reaction just be "if we lock them up, they will just be worse", as if there aren't already?
27. I dont disagree with anything you’ve said here. It absolutely shouldn’t be about punishment and it should be about prevention. That should come from the other agencies. But you have inadvertently stumbled on a failure of this government. NSW and Victoria have set up their social, justice and health systems so they can manage this exact issue how you are suggesting. Qld on the other hand has a rag tag bunch of agencies that are unclear how they hang together. Now, do I think the Libs will solve this problem? The NSW Libs did over the past 12 years, but I have no faith the Qld LNP will! But I also have no faith Queensland Labor would solve either of the current sentencing issues for high risk offenders, or that the will improve the system in the way you suggest because they are too busy with simple solves and announcables rather than real, proper structural reform.
28. We live in the best state in the country but man, a lot of our residents aren’t the sharpest tools in the shed.
29. Mate, you're the one who brought up race in the first place, not me. I’m talking about crime, plain and simple. If these "children" are out there stealing cars, breaking into houses, or doing worse, then yeah, they should face serious consequences. Just because they’re young doesn’t mean they should get a free pass for ruining other people’s lives. You want to treat them like innocent little angels, but when they’re committing adult-level crimes, they should face adult-level consequences. Age shouldn’t be a shield for bad behavior.
30. Get a grip and stop the fear mongering. The sky isn't falling in like people keep crying about.
31. The fact you didn't understand that it doesn't require LNP to introduce a bill for it to be voted on. The fact you called Robbie Katter "Bob" tells me you were thinking of his father. Your general naivety.
32. That's nice. Maybe you've noticed but that is in the past and had no relevance to whatever the fuck KAP is going to propose.
33. Given your stupid comments, I'm guessing One Nation supporter? High school education only. Some kind of tradie. Straight, white guy. Mid 30s?
34. This has been implemented in 400+ schools in the gold coast region. No one was saying a bunch of mums would have to do it for free. Every day care provides meals.
35. respectfully, LNP are pushing for abortion to be illegal and 10 year olds be allowed to be thrown in prison. A ten year old girl could be put in prison for terminating a pregnancy. let that sink in, get over the fucking lunch boxes.
36. Yeah, this is the criticism my mother in law has. She thought the money would be better spent improving education in general. I don't know if I agree, but it's a reasonable take.
37. they chickened out of abortion, that means they're scared of push back. keep doing it.
38. The Green's had a weird night - overall vote looked okay, but target seats ran away from them. I can only think that the Greens have turned off their marginal voters who went away from Labor, by not being willing to compromise on matters that affect the swing Green/Labor voter (like fairer housing policy, energy policy, etc.) Labor is far from guilt free in this, but if it's easier for Labor to steal your policies than work with you, something has broken diplomatically on the left.
39. I know it’s not a contest, however if people are looking to be concerned about issues and are stating rates of these issues as justification for change, then look to where the incidence is actually increasing, particularly when it as at such an alarming rate.
40. I am in Moreton Bay and I know the cases you’re talking about. Yes, it’s real. But where is the evidence that it’s to a higher degree. Both the police and criminologists disagree with you.
41. The problem is, youth crime is at a 20 year low. It's not a true problem, it was a lie told to bolster the political agenda that 10 year olds should be allowed to be thrown in prison.
42. And yes I know you will all be on here saying I’m full of shit and I don’t know what I’m talking about but it’s easy to be a keyboard warrior. Come walk a day in my shoes and let me know how you feel about the subject.
43. I think your missing the broader point here. While the overall stats are indeed going down. The fact that that was Labor msg ignored that in key constituencies there is indeed increasing levels of crime. Townsville and Mackay, and the far north all have increasing rates and numbers of crime. It is only really in the South East corner that there have been significant improvements and because aggregate statistics don't reveal these regional differences Labor's message that the LNP was lying on this issue rang hollow in its traditional heartlands of regional QLD cities. They are now on track to lose every seat in these regional area bar Bunderburg and Cairns i think. The ALP was truthful when they said crime is falling but ignorant when they said it shouldn't be an issue (and that the LNP where lying). The LNP where not truthful when they said there is a crime epidemic but critically they where also not lying, there is, in very specific pockets, and they used this to there advantage. If it wasn't for the piviot in the campaign around abortion the LNP would have picked up more seats, particularly in outer South East QLD, where again the crime stats are not as good as central Brisbane. https://preview.redd.it/2mkv3d1k77xd1.jpeg?width=1394&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=817ee4787fb67632f0905a79b0a5fda26feabd72
44. The fact that it is an issue tells you nothing? The fact that you aren't interested in hearing new perspectives based on the lives of registered voters doesn't say something about you? So if there was police corruption alleged would we all be happy with the police investigating that and reporting on what happened? I wouldn't. I guess you would because you are perfectly happy with the police reporting on their own performance and saying that they're great. I'm sure the Queensland government and its police would never do anything to make themselves get promoted, reelected or paid more. As Prime minister hacker was advised so many years ago about unbiased official reports. Hacker: I thought these planning inspectors were supposed to be impartial? Bernard: Oh, really, Minister. So they are. Railway trains are impartial too. But if you lay down the lines for them, that's the way they go. I guess you already know everything and there's no new information of value. We lost the election because of know-it-all lefties with no empathy or tolerance, full of hate speech for those with different experiences. We're gonna stay out of power until we make friends with registered voters.
45. Spoken like a person that's never had to make a police report. And a person that's never worked with government statisticians. Instead of telling people their lived experience is wrong, maybe ask them about their experience. You can't insult people into supporting you. There's why we lost the election.
46. Sorry it’s in the link .gov.au. It’s right there. The problem.
47. True, but in that specific case it was Russians and the One Nationers had initiated the meeting to ask for money.
48. Dude, what I’m saying is that we haven’t even _tried_ prevention. Labor has failed us pretty hard on that, but I don’t think the LNP’s approach is better. And, truthfully, even the Greens have not really given this a solid try. The others I write off, they’re too right wing to consider it. You say “what about the cases where prevention doesn’t work” - the answer to that is kinda simple, the criminal justice system still exists, as a backstop. But we haven’t even _tried_ other agencies intervening sooner. I don’t think you were intentionally being obstructive, but you kinda hit on the entire problem.
49. > Now, do I think the Libs will solve this problem? The NSW Libs did over the past 12 years, but I have no faith the Qld LNP will! > > But I also have no faith Queensland Labor would solve either of the current sentencing issues for high risk offenders, or that the will improve the system in the way you suggest because they are too busy with simple solves and announcables rather than real, proper structural reform. We are 100% on the same page. The problem is complex, and it doesn't matter who's in power - the answer is the same. More co-ordination to stop crime before it happens. That's at every level of government. It's inarguable that this is the clearly better outcome - less crime, less victims, more opportunities. Like, fucking DUH. Terrifyingly, it seems like Brisbane Reddit thinks "shove them in jail" is the only answer, and punishment is better than prevention. To this I say: fuck you, /r/brisbane. Do better.
50. Thank you your rant tells me all I need to know
51. A woman requiring termination is nice? Gee you’re an odd person. Maybe re-read the headlines, KAP didn’t win government. They can propose whatever they like, just like the Labor party - doesn’t mean anything changes. Enjoy your Sunday.
52. Haha wrong on many fronts. I'll leave you to your tears.
53. They aren’t pushing for that. If they push for that then I’ll rage and fight along with you. Until then, you’re making something up to be outraged about. You’re the one who asked about the lunches, I answered.
54. if you read everything I said and you're still talking about lunch you are a dotard
55. They agree that there is a small core of offenders who keep on reoffending and are getting charged with more and more crimes each time, and those are more serious crimes. That’s supported by my own experiences.
56. No I understand the point, I just believe it's overblown. I absolutely concede that there are some pockets where certain classes of crimes have spikes. It's inevitable, and no government's policy will ever combat that. We can manage and intervene with education and funding and social programs and the like, but "tough on crime" achieves precisely zero net positives. Also, showing a graph that shows all crimes, which includes traffic and other (for the lack of a better term) irrelevant crimes, doesn't really drive home the point. Also, also, pretty expected uptick after opening up post COVID, and a very sharp drop off this past year (so far). It's of course a nuanced topic, and I appreciate when the debate around it is meaningful and good-natured. It's when people claim "CRIME EPIDEMIC" that I'll roll my eyes at.
57. >Spoken like a person that's >maybe ask them about their experience. Again, the irony. I'll insult stupid people saying stupid things. You're now in that group.
58. Ohhhh sorry I didn't realise you were stupid, stupid. Good luck with that
59. We can do this all day people. Like I said. Come out to the real world for a day
60. Oh that’s even worse somehow! Thank you for the info :)
61. I mean, it’s weird you can’t use Google, but sure: https://open-crime-data.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/Crime%20Statistics/region_Reported_Offences_Rates.csv
62. 1000%! I think in typical Reddit fashion it’s either “throw everyone in jail!” Or “no one should ever go to jail” and no in between appreciation that the problem requires much better coordination of government to address all points in the chain, rather than expect that an announcable will fix the problem, or a simple change to sentencing will
63. Yes, it is. But why would you shorten it when his father goes by Bob. Why not use Rob in that case? Either way it is the least of your problems.
64. You're a short sighted fool. You know what I meant despite trying to be clever.
65. Crisafulli voted against it in 2018, he's flip flopped on this to the media but also stated he will allow the public to decide. This is not taking a hard stance, this is clearly a topic he would easily vote against again along with all but 3 of the LNP at the 2018 vote. This is an idea floated several times by the LNP and it is medically dangerous to even do this, they know this. They have just also lowered the criminal age of responsibility to 10 in the NT.
66. Calm down, buddy. There aren't too many places where people discuss policy without resorting to childish name calling. No one is forcing you to hit that post button. You can hop off the internet if you're angry.
67. Fewer offenders committing a greater number of crimes (is that what you meant by higher degree?) is very different to saying that youth crime is increasing overall, which is what they are talking about.
68. Tbh it doesn’t really matter where I live. I travel lots for work. To places that dont really matter to the real world but I live in far North Queensland Sorry, this is not directed at you personally I’m getting fed up defending myself to people that have no clue about what happens outside of there street who’s lives have never been affected by this. It would be a beautiful world/country/state if we all lived in the perfect neighborhood. And I don’t live in a said bad neighborhood. I have money, a career, a beautiful family and friends. But I choose to try and change the parents of these kids who constantly rampage the streets day and night. It’s a lost cause that quite simply will not change. I could go to any town,city,suburb in Australia and find this problem. To state statistics that is on the downfall is purely a joke. It sounds like a political stance that makes our country look good, but the sad fact is our politicians can continue to sweep issues under the rug but how long till under the rug is full and the minute someone speaks against the grain(government) they are labelled. This country is falling badly and something needs to change. It’s high time people stop living in a dream world and accept the fact of what is happening to this great nation of ours.
