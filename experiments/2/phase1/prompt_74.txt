Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Projection is real. You just have to see the name calling and abuse directed to people here. Labor is all emotion. Support us or you hate child, hate women,are racist. Look at the free lunches spending 1.6b on a problem that does not exist for 95% of the population. A non emotional policy would have targetted intervention so kids that need it. Do get better access but that does not make you feel as good as feeding everyone even if it a waste
2. Can’t wait to see this sub’s reaction tomorrow night when the LNP win rofl
3. Miss the age where ABC news non bias simple strict forward. Now turn into leftist playground.
4. You made a slight spelling mistakr there. I'm sure you meant to say. The AlLP policies are all fluff and bubble like all brain dead LWNJ's
5. Yeah because they have to wait for their policies to be handed to them
6. I don't understand what's happening. He couldn't be doing a better job of trying *not* to be elected. Continual backtracking and a total lack of clarity on what his positions are. And yet people are buying it up and we're still going to elect him. I don't know who is worse, him or us.
7. Yeah, if you ask the police to target a certain demographic, i.e.young people, then the crime numbers will go up for that demographic.
8. I don't know if turning your grief into a political campaign is really a good way to mourn. I understand that he probably wants to turn his pain into some sort of change, that's a very human thing. But surely there are much more constructive ways to do this without letting a political party exploit your grief.
9. He’s been well and truly taken advantage of by the LNP. He’s running for Capalaba which sits on a 9.8% margin and has a popular mp- I doubt it’s going to flip so he’s not going to get the spoils of being a government MP. But his story, broadcast ad nauseam has gained the LNP a lot of voters and has probably helped parachute them into office.
10. Yeah I really truely felt sorry about what happened to that guy’s family. It just was gut wrenching reading about it and I wanted to know more what happened to the offender/murderer. I couldn’t find much information online but I truly feel that the affected family has justice to the best. From the sound of things he was telling, the government didn’t do enough and that’s what got me a bit concerned at his speech. He lost quite a lot and I think it would have been great from the government to at least tell public what have been done particularly in Russell’s case and let people be judge if it was enough or not but if it’s not being clarified, it just means to me it was either not worth bringing or it would have been a negative impact on their campaign. I can say for sure it’s worth bringing so yeah the other reason is the only thing I’m a bit concerned about. Could more be done? In what ways it wasn’t enough? Why Russell’s thinks it’s not enough and what his family wanted the outcome from it? All these questions unfortunately I couldn’t find satisfactory answers too. His story is very sad and deeply concerning for the youth crime issue.
11. I just found this.... and ok it puts LNP costs less than LAB but 6.4B for the Department of Transport WTF! 60% of their spending is to the department that did a ton of work on the South East Freeway and now less than a decade after finishing that are removing or have plans to remove the exits they put in. The Department of Transport needs a serious audit and this is the opposite. But take a big drink of water, hold it in your mouth and then check the Green's number lower down. [https://research.qut.edu.au/best/queensland-election-spending-promises/](https://research.qut.edu.au/best/queensland-election-spending-promises/) This document really needs some dates on it though. I dont think it could capture all the things that were dropped last minute yesterday but it was the only thing I can find.
12. Hidden away from any scrutiny and yet people want to vote for them?
13. Just to be somewhat objective the article is pretty daming of the current situation under Labor. "When there is not enough staff, children are locked in their rooms alone. They do not go to school, play sports or socialise. The lockdowns, known as separation, can last for many days at a time. The report found the separations were affecting the wellbeing of children and posed human rights issues."
14. What are you guys gonna do with your spare time after the LNP wins tomorrow? This has obviously been an incredibly taxing few weeks of foaming mouth outrage, I hope you get to wipe your mouth and take a breath.
15. I did post that title and it is different from the articles, my bad.
16. Hang in there, only a couple more days till the ALP operatives delete their accounts and leave.
17. No you can go labor way of just buying votes.
18. Pretty emotional and poorly written comment right there, projecting much?
19. > Miss the age where ABC news *was unbiased*, simple, *and straight* forward. >Now *it has turned into a* leftist playground. Corrections in italics for you there bud. Thanks for confirming that most people who support the LNP are barely literate and poorly educated 🤙🏻
20. ^[Sokka-Haiku](https://www.reddit.com/r/SokkaHaikuBot/comments/15kyv9r/what_is_a_sokka_haiku/) ^by ^bobbakerneverafaker: *Yeah because they have* *To wait for their policies* *To be handed to them* --- ^Remember ^that ^one ^time ^Sokka ^accidentally ^used ^an ^extra ^syllable ^in ^that ^Haiku ^Battle ^in ^Ba ^Sing ^Se? ^That ^was ^a ^Sokka ^Haiku ^and ^you ^just ^made ^one.
21. > I don't know who is worse. If he gets in, the Queensland Voter is worse, for seeing all of this and *still* thinking *"Yeah, this is my guy"* I'm holding out hope that Labor can scrape through by the skin of their teeth though, they've done a great job closing the gap over the last few weeks.
22. Over this campaign he done a very good job of showing us who he is and what kind of leader he will be. Recent polling shows that some people have been paying attention. When someone shows you exactly who they are, you would do well to listen to them.
23. 17 yo got 10 years, has to do 60% of the sentence, out in 2027.
24. Yeh! I just wanted to know if they were giving $2b back to their mates (coal tariffs)
25. Agree 100% *but history shows* the LNP always make massive cuts to government services and staffing and without them clearly stating they are going to undertake a massive recruitment drive and or a plan to address the high turn over rates from the article (25.5%) we know things will only get even worse under LNP.
26. Frankly I don't care as I don't vote for Labor but ***know QLD*** will go massively backwards if the LNP win, see massive budget blowouts and a really poor preparation for the stupid Olympics that we really don't need. How are they going to have any budget if they cut the coal Royalities and give them massive TAX breaks just so 1-2 of them will get a golden parachute post-politics? The grift is real.
27. Yeah because we're all fake accounts, even though mine is 10 years old and organic... The fucking mental gymnastics of LNP supporters is seriously impressive.
28. You say that as if the LNP, some of their more rabid supporters, and sometimes just outright bots haven't been hard at work canvassing all the different subreddits, Facebook pages, online newspaper forums, etc. I've seen more than a few accounts feverishly responding and commenting to every post, and sometimes even every comment thread. And not about to forget that there are companies who are paid to do exactly this kind of thing and have done so for the LNP before. Cambridge Analytica ring any bells?
29. Yea, mostly likely. It will seem insane on this sub though, which is why it’ll be funny to see.
30. It's pretty terrifying to know that close to the majority of the people you interact with on a day to day basis look at the things he's doing and are perfectly able to consciously vote for him with 0 issues. Like I'm not great fan of Labor but it's beyond fucked that they've had to "close the gap" instead of instantly jumping to overwhelmingly astronomically favoured the second any of Crisafulli's shit started to come out.
31. It’s actually not that hard to understand really. There are those who believe the fluff about the crime and think crime is rampant (they get their news from one of 3 channels (7, 9 or 10) or the newspaper) and then believe abortion is murder. At that point, it’s really easy to understand why some people will still buy into it. I’m not saying it’s a good idea or anything but I can totally understand the rationale behind why those people still support DC.
32. Gotta say I didn’t see Capalaba flipping and not Springwood.
33. It is just unsettling. I wish I knew the full picture. If the person feels the guilt and what is his state now. It’s so sad. My heart sinks on Russell’s story. The world I left behind didn’t leave for the world like this if it turned out like that one day. Anyway thank you for the information.
34. Don't worry, I'm a 14 year Reddit veteran and apparently i'm an LNP shill :D
35. The account that posted this is 59 days old. Cmon bro. There’s zero mental gymnastics here.
36. The evidence is not that strong - [Exit poll shockwaves: Phenomenal Labor surge makes election too close to call | The Courier Mail : r/queensland](https://www.reddit.com/r/queensland/comments/1gcft00/exit_poll_shockwaves_phenomenal_labor_surge_makes/)
37. Yeah this dude’s borderline illegible comment has me overcome with emotion, I’m wracked. How will I ever compose myself enough to get to the polling booth?
38. I think they're just isolated from information and aggressively defensive to anyone who tries to help.
39. Man, one entire side of my family is fully on board with the LNP platform and it’s really concerning. Usually I just overlook this stuff, but this time round I’ve lost a lot of respect for their political intelligence and/or moral compasses (depending on which is most relevant) because to vote for this party in this election is to either lack empathy for your fellow human beings or be deliberately ignorant of the situation.
40. My reply wasn't to the parent comment, it was to digby99, who implied that the pro Labor comments were from fake accounts. This is a biiiig stretch, considering the party known to deal in misinformation, bot farming, and doublespeak is not the ALP, but spooks who answer to big businesses and mining lobbyists.
41. Yea, we shall see - pre polling likely LNP they say, ballot less of a swing…maybe it won’t be called tonight like I said
42. This is good news to anyone who wants to hear it. Tried having this convo with my grandparents their response is "anyone who is stupid enough to do drugs deserves the consequences", so it's not about science or harm reduction, it's about inflicting as much damage as possible to those you think deserve it. That was my takeaway, anyway. Love the Vietnam generation. Wish they were more sensible and progressive
43. LNP voters see drug users as sub human. they would like them to all die
44. Any party that's uses we believe in a statement to change legislation shouldn't be in a position to affect it
45. As someone who is firmly on the right on most issues, this is not one of them. The “war on drugs” is stupid, and has done little to nothing to stop drug use, so education and testing is a far better approach. I party a lot, and use the service at Bowen Hills regularly to make sure me and my friends are safe.
46. LNP " None of our white christian people do these drugs so why do we care! let them all die" Labor/People with humanity " Wtf LNP!"
47. Well, that's the final nail in the coffin for the LNP. We're meant to be progressing as a society, not go backwards, you DC's.
48. The LNP are not the brightest people in the electorate. They just want all of us to look up to them. Because reasons. Uncosted illogical untested reasons. And they want our money.
49. I have been both an official and unofficial pill tester at festivals etc for over 30 years and can honestly say that the vast majority of punters when told their gear is bunk or adulterated will still neck them any way I'm not saying its a great policy to drop just stating from experience the harm reduction effects are often over stated (and the harm a lot of the time too)
50. This whole system is a fRIGGING joke. Do we support this? Do we agree to throw kids in jail at 10 or 12?? Do we take away more human rights, ban abortions Do we drug the masses?? Wtf!!!! They're all the same i vote anarchy !!!!
51. Like the ALP juvenile laws. How many people have been killed in their own homes where they should be safe?
52. But if you tell them they have a coffee addiction and they should ease up it’s the classic I don’t have an addiction I don’t need it I like it. A generation of hypocrites
53. Odd, as many of them (appear to) love alcohol - which itself is an extremely dangerous liquid poison linked directly to many societal, health and crime issues.
54. Same way they see the unemployed and students and those who are chronically unwell or hungry, and the working class , people who want to control their own reproductive rights, women, the marginalised, the refugees, and First Nations people . LNP are awful
55. It’s not just people with humanity… Everyone uses “drugs”. Every “drug” has the potential to be (silently) abused, and cause problems. … just look at alcohol, for example.
56. > I have been both an official and unofficial pill tester at festivals etc for over 30 years Ok I'm going to ask - what is an unofficial pill tester? Do you take a lick or a nibble, see what happens, and hand it back? I know that official pill testing includes actual analysis but I'm now very curious!
57. In those roles, what was the actual process? My understanding is the recent government funded program is based on overseas models like in the UK. The core aspect is people getting the opportunity to sit down and actually have a conversation about drug use with health professionals.
58. If they're boomers they likely drink more than any of the young people they know
59. Of course, they only don't like drugs when the poors do it. Those people are bad and should be punished. They know for certain that they'll never be policed about their drug use, because they're not poor. These laws don't impact them in the slightest, so they support them.
60. many arent capable of entertaining that kind of thought. one of them is legal. the other is illegal (in their eyes)
61. yeah there's a reason bottle shop's remained open during lock downs!
62. Early days we just set up using eztest kits and when mass spectrometers became dirt cheap from ebay it was a game changer
63. No one is wasting their time at a music festival talking to a doctor or scientist unless they are already munted
64. > One of them is legal. the other is illegal (in their eyes) Nope, not just in their eyes, in the eyes of the law.
65. I think your experience in pill testing over the past 30 years is different to the modern evidence based model being implemented. It be should rolled out for a period of time to determine if outcomes improve. The LNP dismantling it now helps no one.
66. As someone who goes to a lot a festivals, and talks to hundreds of people on drugs, MOST of them (normally 18-23) would still take the drugs even if they aren’t what they thought they were. Most people over that age will not use them.
67. A lot of younger recreation users do in fact use pill testing kits..
68. True, but that's why the long-term solution is education to change the culture. Those interactions with health professionals is the only opportunity young people have to engage in an honest, informed, and consequence free conversation about drug use. They can't access that with family, friends, teachers etc. The feedback from overseas models is young people are surprisingly upfront and genuine in these interactions.
69. I’m not disagreeing, I’m for pill testing, I use the service a lot in Brisbane. But, younger people, generally, will take the drugs either way (mainly speed/meth found in “ecstasy”)…… mainly as they can’t afford to throw them away.
70. No you didn't, but in my experience, if they're testing their gear, they'll also not take it if its something dodgy. Of course you'll still get those that don't, or those that buy from randoms and take it without checking, but with a lot of younger users buying from the darknet, it's become a lot safer. I read a report about the rare of dangerous adulterants in party drugs having decreased with darknet market use increasing. Sellers actually have a vested interest in not cutting their gear with alternatives since they either won't get paid, since the payment is kept in escrow, and the risk to their business from bad reviews
71. I know how the darknet works lol. Problem is; the majority of users are NOT buying from the darknet, they are buying it after it’s been touched a few times, drunk, while they are out. Anyway….. pill testing is important. Stay safe.
72. Seriously, the flood map is an incredible resource - especially for those who haven't lived in Brisbane forever and a day, so don't know by memory what's prone to flooding and what's not.
73. "... While others will be reclassified to reflect... An increased risk of flooding" . Alternate headline: "UP TO 7000 BRISBANE properties are about to be reclassified as flood prone or at risk by the BCC"
74. Sure we’re on floodplains, but our stormwater system sucks. Council needs to stop giving hand outs to developers and make them fund the required stormwater infrastructure.
75. Oh, well that's a bit concerning... My house went from light blue to dark blue. Good thing I have flood insurance, and am moving out at the end of next month 😬
76. Increase house valuations = increased land valuation = more land tax = more monies! Win win win! Hydro modelling would of been watched by the government.
77. Thank you for sharing! This is actually useful content and not just politics spam!
78. The thing that stands out for me on Brisbane's flood map, is how much of Brisbane doesn't flood.
79. The link to the updated maps doesn’t look like it shows what’s been updated, any ideas?
80. These flood models are still being presented using current day scenarios in terms of statistical rainfall and mean sea level figures. The council has run scenarios based on 2050 and 2100 scenarios reflecting the impacts of climate variability. The results are in the reports but not reflected in either the planning scheme or the online flood awareness map tool. So there are developments being built today designed on current day climate scenarios that with the full knowledge of future scenarios will not be up to code and at flood risk. Not including these in the city plan or even available in the flood awareness maps is short sited. I should say, any update of these models is positive and based on the latest information and technology. But they should be presenting the full suite of information.
81. Won't make a difference to insurance premiums, I take it. While I live in the Ipswich area, our home is at least 500 meters from the Bremer River, overlooks a park that would act as a reservior in a major flood event, and is elevated at least 4 meters above road level when you factor the slope on the property. Yet, our home is still classified as being a "flood risk".
82. I 100% believe this sort of data should be a living document, regularly re-assessed, but the problem with Council's track record is I can never trust that the assessment isn't somewhat influenced by where influential developers are planning a project.
83. Doesn’t mean they won’t flood 😂 whats that new way to steal the peoples money now ?
84. Was really good for me moving from Logan to Sandgate. Never had to deal with potential flooding until now
85. The best stormwater infrastructure is open green space. Turning a 100 year old concrete drain in Stones Corner into Hanlon Park helped prevent major flooding in 2022. As well as being able to absorb more water, the reeds slowed the flow of water. Meanwhile, flooding upstream at Annerley where it's still a concrete drain was worse in 2022 than in 2011.
86. Next owner or won’t have it or will pay a leg every year to keep it. How do you see the change? I thought (by reading the article) it would only be released December.
87. They have learned nothing from any of the big floods. The completion of Wivenhoe Dam was used as an excuse to take a lot of properties off the post-1974 flood map. Many of them flooded again in 2011.
88. I don't think it's that nefarious. More likely that modelling simply spat out the result that it wasn't worth the upkeep of maintaining those 1000 properties on the overlay given likely flood conditions, than some kind of deep-seated conspiracy to take flood-prone properties and declassify them in order to increase stamp duty.
89. Read the post and not the headline. 8000 properties affected, of which 1000 removed. So it could be 7000 properties at increased risk. Based on previous models and recent floods it's quite likely they will be documented as being more at risk
90. would *have (in case you are interested). Or *would've, if you prefer the contraction. You're welcome.
91. Do council receive the land tax though? I assumed it went to the general revenue of the QLD government. I’m sure the increase in land value will increase council rates, though.
92. The science behind climate change is very much in its infancy. Engineers and their clients know that they have to allow for it, but it's not clear what to allow for. If say that the maps and codes allow for a 1% increase in the rainfall and it actually ends up at 2%, or 5%, then the authorities would be criticised for not allowing enough. So, map the now, have a stab at what might happen in 25 or 75 years and report on it accordingly. (just thinking... the City Plan could require DA to address climate change as well... maps could show as potential future risk...) Bottom line: Brisbane is built beside a river that floods. If you want to avoid flood risk then don't build by a creek or the River. Good read: [A River With a City Problem ](https://www.uqp.com.au/books/a-river-with-a-city-problem)
93. It is though? Council have a rolling, ongoing program to regularly review and update their flood modelling and flood mapping. That’s what this update is about…
94. You’ve got this exactly backwards, developers treat these maps like gospel so they don’t lose their assets to a flood during construction and because flood zones directly inform the construction standards that will be used, which all parties involved are interested in doing as accurately as possible.
95. Agreed but unfortunately the only thing Council knows to do with greenspace is sell it off
96. Or the flood zones were done by computer and then people went around and said no, wait, that property has the house at the top of the hill and it will be fine.
97. Yes... and what I'm saying is that I don't trust there to not be a level of interference in the final findings, influenced by whose land is being assessed.
98. To their credit, BCC funded Hanlon Park. Covid put a stop to the next bit of the drain, then the 2022 flood happened.
99. That happens, though it's not that inaccurate. The ground surface is done off LIDAR mapping, which has a level of accuracy. The flood modelling simulates using a grid that could be small (say a couple of metres) to large (tens of metres) depending on how big the flood study is. If the LIDAR can't pick up the edge of a creek, then it might think the flood level spills over and onto the adjacent plains. Then engineers would ground truth and discover actually that the creek is deeper with a steep bank that's higher than the modelled flood level. This happened on a project I'm working on.
100. I mean that’s a pretty big stretch, they publish all of their flood modelling reports openly and all of the studies have been completed by reputable tier 1 engineering firms….
101. True we should give them that credit. I’m based near Milton where greenspace is cooked.
102. To be fair, they approved an old folks home in a known flood plain because the land wasn't otherwise in use...
