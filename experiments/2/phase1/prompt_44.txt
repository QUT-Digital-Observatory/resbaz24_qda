Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Disabled endometriosis and fibromyalgia sufferer here. What if I have an ovarian cyst rupture, like I have in the past? I can't afford ambulance fees. There's a small chance I'll get sepsis and die. What if I had to go on the contraceptive pill to manage my endo symptoms? Is getting rid of that on the table, too? Merely speaking for me here. So many others have it so much worse. Wow, getting downvoted for sharing my legitimate fears. I hate this.
2. Why was "Adult time for adult crimes" such a successful slogan when it genuinely just means "I want to send kids to prison"?
3. Happens every so often. ALP gets complacent from being in power so long and people think a change will change that. Little do they know, in 3yrs time when QLD Gov services are at breaking point, they'll vote the ALP back in. Additionally I think the north has greatly affected the outcome. Maybe we should rethink the Japanese line.
4. A few years ago I chose to have a termination for medical reasons as my daughter had very complex and severe heart defects. A paediatric cardiologist wrote a really long list of what to expect if the pregnancy continued and my husband and I chose to suffer so that she would not have to. It was so, so hard to actually end my pregnancy at 18weeks... And that was with termination legal. No public hospital would touch me and an abortion clinic was not recommended to me for my mental and physical health. I can't imagine what women would go through to end a pregnancy for medical reasons if abortion becomes illegal.
5. there is a rally planned for 1st nov for abortion rights, by the national union of students https://preview.redd.it/nwluzp1f18xd1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=722385ff15624286de262bddb6b4d799a2a4029d
6. I thoroughly enjoy the fact that these dickheads talk tough on crime and in the end, nothing changes. Bunch of Muppets in NQ think this will solve breaking into your homes and stealing your shit. Nothing has ever changed there, it's been the SAME cycle for decades and the only thing that's changed has been a population increase a long with a substantial increase in cost of living. You had kids picking fights with adults, breaking into homes and stealing cars while growing up there. When my parents were kids, guess what? The same thing, THE SAME FUCKING THING! Everytime they get in power and I just have to laugh at the gullibility of your average human being. Not even just being gullible, having the people at 30 years old say "I don't vote, it's all stupid". We really, really, should NOT have mandatory voting, fml.
7. You cunts are going to be cooked. Lucky for me i was only living here for a year and get to fuck off back to my state in Jan. I cant believe how many people voted for the LNP when they offered up damn near no plan. It was the politics version of “here you go sir. Here is my ass hole for you to do as you please. Just don’t forget the lube”
8. Boomers like my father have royally screwed us over this time. I was stupid to think that labour had a chance, now we have to sit back and be at the whim of Campbell 2.0 and his lackeys. As I said on the children by choice AMA, we need to go big and hard if they come for the abortion laws. Like the French do. My theory for all of this isn't necessarily for religious beliefs, while they do pay a part, the government is sweating lately about our aging population. They want more cannon fodder for their stupid proxy wars and for the working class to keep propping the rich up. They're mad because they've created a world in which no one wants to raise children.
9. It's insane that a party with only 2% of votes, gets more seats than those parties with 7%, or 9%
10. I went on the sky news post on fb this morning, the boomers are so fkn happy. Makes me sick. They are ECSTATIC
11. I could be off the mark here but it wouldn't surprise me if it's not a top priority for Katter. Let's say he did it to shift the election (almost did) to cause a hung parliament then which party would hold the keys to government? Katter has a lot of legitimate gripes about the treatment of regional Qld, I could be way off but wouldn't be surprised if he used abortion as a way to gain more power. People in SEQ really don't understand how much regions get shafted. I'm sure Katter still holds those beliefs on abortion though but I can't see it being a priority for him.
12. When did Katter backtrack? He gave a round about answer yesterday that all but confirmed he plans a vote.
13. So what is this LNP pelicans actually plan for QLD ?
14. It’s funny how after watching the results on tv, everyone says to one another “well I didn’t vote for them” “neither did I”. Is there data available on what demographic actually voted for LNP
15. Why stop at controlling woman's bodies? If we pass a law that make abortion illegal, then we should step a little bit further. Let men have the ability to opt out of fatherhood. Like if we are turning the screws of oppression then let's really fuck them over by taking away their support systems.
16. Such a shame as the Katter party have been awesome for North QLD. Representing issues that matter to us. Unfortuantely they’ve decided to back this anti-abortion stance which a lot of us don’t support. You’ll find a lot of people still voted that way anyway due to their other policy’s etc.
17. There's a protest/rally thing at George square 6pm on Friday, I saw a poster on Instagram, DM me if you want me to send it through
18. As a NSWelshman, I haven't followed the Queensland campaign closer. I was watching the coverage of the results on Sky News last night and was completely clueless about what they were talking about when mentioning the abortion issue. Can someone explain to me what went on with that?
19. Keep it to a debate and don't be idiots about it difficulty=impossible
20. I'm honestly stunned and disappointed with this result, but I need to ask, if the LNP won by such a big margin, where are all the people going "Yippee, LNP won!"? Off watching Sky news I suppose.
21. This is rural QLDs fault and the fucking gold coast. Dumb uneducated hicks.
22. if I could move to WA I would, I feel ashamed to be a Queenslander.
23. Honestly it makes no difference in reality. The rich will get richer, the poorer will get poorer and the politicians will be more focussed on themselves and how much money THEY can get do themselves. The one concern I have is that my daughters will be betrayed by a state government about choice on abortion rights which is something they are both passionate about.
24. The federal election is next May(?) so Crisafulli will be under strict orders from Dutton not to do anything stupid until then at least.
25. Strange how people are trying to talk this up as a nailbiter. 53 seats to 34 and a 2PP of 54-46 is a landslide win in any language.
26. Who gives a fuck about abortion, the LNP plan is to decrease the royalties on minerals and coal to zero, and lock it in with legislation for the next 100 years.
27. since 1989 the lnp have been in power only 5 years. they always screw it up.
28. Tbh I'm really tired and sleep isn't fixing it and I really just don't care about any of this anymore. $20 penalty fee thanks.
29. Friday 1st November, 6PM, King George Square there is a pro-choice rally. I will be there.
30. They would have to be on crack to do: a) make abortion illegal (saying see ya to the female vote in 2028) b) do a Newman (saying see ya to everyone else in 2028) I can't see abortion being criminalised and I can see the Liberals learing from the 2012-2015 fiasco
31. Last time, LNP got voted in by a landslide. Mostly due to their campaign blaming ALP for the 2011 floods. Then, after the reckless damage Campbell Newman caused in such a short amount of time, they were voted out by a landslide. Shame we have to go through this whole process again.
32. I wonder what they’ll do about gay rights too. Labor made a lot of progress so there’s a lot of hate they can unleash there too.
33. Enjoy the madness of the next four years. Every piece of shit small business involved in shifty shit knowing there will be nothing they can do wrong. Enjoy the crazy prices. Enjoy the fuck ups when they sack all the planners from government. Enjoy the weirdos who voted LNP crying in their beer when they see the fuck up they caused.
34. >Are there any rallies or protests that are being planned to make sure that it doesn't come up in parliament? What makes you think a rally or protest will pursuade a newly elected government that has just won a comfortable majority? The new government did not rule out a conscience vote on abortion legislation. The majority of Queenslanders, for better or worse, have backed the new government, including the government's stance on abortion legislation and conscience voting.
35. Abortion issue is the first time I want to get out and protest, and I’m a dude. Fuck the direction this country is headed
36. The majority of people are socially conservative. Even Lenin recognised this. Leftism is only popular when it's redistributing wealth to lower classes and improving their living standards. They aren't up for the socially progressive politics i.e abortion, immigration, diversity, sexual liberation ect. This stuff is only popular with upper middle class white people who live around cities and the handful of minorities who aspire to be them. If the left want to win they should at least pretend to want to improve the living standards of the majority of the working class. That means lowering living costs, reducing crime in working class areas and find a way for immigration not to look like you are actively replacing the working class that you are supposed to represent. Either that or they have to replace their current voting base with a new one.
37. I'm waiting with popcorn to see Fuckafoolie vs the Potato on nuclear power in Queensland.
38. I've been fuming all day and had been also thinking about posting here to see if anyones up for a protest /riot/ revolt!
39. Public support for abortion is over 65%, it wold be political suicide to back track laws yes there are pockets of majority religious types who are pro life, but that's healthy in a democratic society. Labor and greens shot themselves in the foot trying to make abortion an election issue when it was only a sound bite grab from the Katters who even thought we cared
40. “Now, if you’re asking me about, would I ever support recriminalising it, the answer is absolutely no … “Do you believe in a woman’s right to choose, yes or no?” he asked. “It probably won’t work for his TikTok, but yes,” Crisafulli responded. “There will be no changes to abortion laws if government changes in Queensland,” Crisafulli responded.
41. LNP, Give them a chance, you might find you're all better off! Respect QLD voters. They voted for change and if your side did not win oh well. Live life!
42. As someone who was thinking of moving to Brisbane (yes I know), the result of this vote after LNPs campaign has actually made me reconsider. I don't want to live in a state run by leaders who have such a dislike of their own constituents and worth a majority of people who support that view. Might go with Perth instead.
43. Rip I really enjoyed 50c buses, fairer coal royalties and reproductive rights while it lasted
44. Main focus from the conservative parties of QLD is to tighten the abortion laws not abolish them completely… QLD has some of the weakest abortion laws in the country, if not the whole world. Abortion is legal up until birth in QLD & there are no laws regarding babies born alive through failed late term abortions. The pro-life community are obviously outraged. After Steven miles changed the abortion legislation, he promised late term abortions would not rise & yet they doubled per year. Controversial aspects of the current abortion legislation that the conservative parties of QLD are focused on are: - Abortion permitted up until birth. - Failed late term abortions, where babies are born alive, have no medical rights & do not require medical care. - QLD having the highest rate of abortion pills prescribed, yet having a significantly lower population than NSW & VIC. - Gender selective abortions. I will note that I am a conservative, however, I support a woman’s right to access a termination of pregnancy in permitted & justified circumstances. But I think that QLD’s current laws are a little extreme at present.
45. It won't get through; Crisafulli almost lost an unloseable election because of it.
46. Little surprise? It’s been quite a big surprise for me given how similar the LNP and ALP policies were. I was expecting a much tighter election.
47. Can’t help feel like abortion laws in America and soon to be Aus has more to do with meeting replacement rates of citizens than anything else.
48. Absolute media nonsense. Why anyone would look at America and think let’s take away abortion. LNP are two degrees right of labour. They’ll want more than one term.
49. The sooking here is hilarious. Welcome to the world outside your little left wing eco chamber
50. So, if the LNP have a clear majority, and abortion law is not on their agenda, they can literally shut down any bill the moment it is proposed. That’s how our state works. Stop running around saying the sky is falling. It’s not.
51. It seems odd many are complaining and acting things will get worse with not a day in power yet for LNP. Despite what gets said here - Brisbane currently ranks 2nd most expensive for rent, 2nd most expensive for utilities, most expensive for internet, most expensive for washing facilities, most expensive bar Canberra for a lunch out on work days, most expensive for milk and eggs and bread, most expensive for cars, amazingly most expensive for fuel (how???)… We are the 2nd most expensive place to live with the 5th highest salaries (close to 6th by a few dollars). All this with competitive advantages from agriculture and mining perspectives. Is it maybe a case of things are necessarily as rosie posie under current rule as some are making out to be?
52. Queenslander here and I'm all for separating from the mining areas above CQ. Suggest Queensland Gov keeps the cities approx 100 km inland along the east coast down to NSW. Let the basket cases have the resource sector and the rest of the State can concentrate on developing agriculture, primary industries, tourism, and boost manufacturing to replace the revenue. A big chunk of the State are absolute basket cases and the thought of those nutters with big hats telling women what to do with their ovaries enrages me. Bob Katter suggesting dangerous semi automatic guns be available will increase domestic violence expotentially. I believe if we can decrease domestic violence, then child violence will reduce, especially with help from the whole of the community such as neighbours and teachers willing to have a discreet word with parents of young, vulnerable kids at risk of being influenced by older siblings etc.
53. What a beautiful day today - Libs won and reddit is in full meltdown mode lmaooo
54. abortion was horribly weaponised when no change was on the table. the Labor Law was done on a conscience vote for Labor and Liberal as it should be. Now all of a sudden Labor, with no actual record to run on , used it as a wedge. As for the debate, I cant see any reasonable person could refuse the Babies Born Alive Bill, we are talking clear infanticide. and having Abortion up until birth is one of the most extreme laws in the world. whether it should be illegal is another debate. the best of both sides of the issue are trying to adopt a caring attitude, albeit selectively.
55. Katter went from 4 seats to 1 seat. Surely that tells you all you need to know? + The LNP have NEVER said they would seek to change Abortion or VAD laws. Opposite. They gave clearly stated they are not interested. This issue is a storm in a teacup. Clung onto by the ALP to frighten people. Stop being so silly. What a gullible lot so many if you are
56. The abortion topic was likely just a scare tactic with misinformation from Labor, LNP have said numerous times now that they won’t be touching abortion laws or women’s rights. The only reason they haven’t answered it with a more direct answer is for the obvious reason of not wanting to upset their religious base/affiliates. I would be very surprised if anything changes on the abortion front over these next 4 years. If it does then I would (un)happily eat my words.
57. Largely, protesting is illegal, and also deliberately impossible such that it effects politicians.
58. Crisafaulli has clearly stated that they aren't looking at it.
59. The greens are gone which was just the icing on the cake.
60. I am pretty excited to see what LNP can offer
61. ALP has run the state 30 of the last 35 years. Campbell Newman being the exception. I think there is a general distain for Crisafulli right now due to a range of factors. Have to see what he does in the position before he can be criticised as premier.
62. is reddit a left-wing echo chamber? how come everytime politics is discussed, left-wing always wins. goes to show you folks are the vocal minority haha
63. guys everyone chill, even though i voted for labor i dont care that LNP won. nothings bad going to happen, we are still australia, can we not let politics become divisive like it is in america? ur all over-reacting like typical liberals on reddit. be happy it was resulted fair and square yeah? take a chill pill
64. The fear mongering on this sub has been crazy, really sad to see. Here's hoping Amy MacMahon can still somehow come out in top for south Brisbane and not Labors terrible option.
65. I can’t forgot what Labor did when keeping family members out from seeing dying relatives during COVID and the cruelty around that. Happy we have a fresh start 💙
66. Isn't it as simple as having a [Referendum](https://documents.parliament.qld.gov.au/explore/education/factsheets/factsheet_6.2_referendums.pdf) for stuff like this?
67. Crime is out of control under the LNP now if their stats are correct surely
68. Democracy won, your personal vote lost. That’s how it works in the real world and this experience will better you for when you eventually head out into yourself.
69. Knowing many typically conservative voters, I dont know a single person who wants abortion laws changed. It wasn't even on the table.. it was a last ditch effort to try and fear monger voters away from the LNP. So who exactly do you propose protesting to?? I for one am sick and tired of all these irrelevant protests in our city. I'll add this to the list until it actually becomes an issue.
70. Can someone summarise for me, why (except in extreme circumstances e.g rape) stricter abortion laws is very bad? With the use of contraceptives (Condom + birth control etc), isn’t the potential of bearing a child so low?
71. I’m 50 and girls were having abortions without trouble when I was 15. I can’t see that changing.
72. I'm sorry but In no world in mass infanticide a good thing. If you think it is you really should take a look at the state of yourself and your community.
73. so here are the countries than ban abortion - commenting on the USA is unfair and demonstrates a certain bias. [Countries Where Abortion Is Illegal 2024](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/countries-where-abortion-is-illegal) || || |[Andorra](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/andorra)|[Haiti](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/haiti)|[Malta](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/malta)|[Republic of the Congo](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/republic-of-the-congo)| |Aruba|[Honduras](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/honduras)|[Mauritania](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/mauritania)|[San Marino](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/san-marino)| |Curaçao (territory)|[Iraq](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/iraq)|[Nicaragua](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/nicaragua)|[Senegal](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/senegal)| |[Dominican Republic](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/dominican-republic)|[Jamaica](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/jamaica)|[Palau](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/palau)|[Sierra Leone](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/sierra-leone)| |[Laos](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/laos)|[Palestine](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/palestine)|[Suriname](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/suriname)|[Tonga](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/tonga)| |[El Salvador](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/el-salvador)|[Madagascar](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/madagascar)|[Philippines](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/philippines)| so maybe you should call them backwards them as well?
74. only time abortion should be legal is for rape cases. Can’t just have 16 year old Susie getting run thru weekly and killing a few babies a year
75. Why are we even talking about abortion in a state where women are murdered daily by their male family members ?
76. so here are the countries than ban abortion - commenting on the USA is unfair and demonstrates a certain bias. Andorra, Aruba, the Dominican Republic, Laos, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Iraq, Jamaica, Madagascar, Malta, Mauritania, Nicaragua, Palau, Suriname, the Philippines, the Republic of the Congo, San Marino, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Tongo have completely outlawed abortion. ([Countries Where Abortion Is Illegal 2024](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/countries-where-abortion-is-illegal)) so maybe you should call them backwards them as well?
77. Ah, already taking the views of her constituents into consideration 😵‍💫
78. It's gone. I mean, not answering 120+ times and you think "oh you know, it might just all work out in the end". They're gone. They will try to use Katter as a scapegoat but you all know they're all gonna Mario twist spin like a fucking comet down on that "FUCKING SEEYAAAA" button when they're sworn in. Lol I know it isn't directed specifically at you. But I can't believe how much of an "oh, well um.. I guess I hope everything works out after this...." from people I am seeing. Chickens voting for Steggals
79. Keep up the pressure. She's a moderate I'm pretty sure. 3 moderates voted with Labor to decriminalisation abortion and they might be our only shot at keeping it that way. She can't block your emails and phone calls.
80. She did that to me too. There goes the area.
81. Sounds like she really cares about the people she is supposed to be serving. /s Do politicians forget that it is the public that they are supposed to be serving and that's literally the whole point of their job as public servants. I think they need a good reminding of that fact.
82. Also in Aspley and I may just be optimistic but I'm holding out hope Bart Mellish gets through in the official count. Last night, the LNP had a pretty convincing win over the first preferences but the ABC's projection of the final count is quite close (50.7% LNP vs 49.3% ALP). Not sure what the error margins are on that projection but should be interesting nonetheless.
83. Of course ALL LNP members would have been directed to just not "go there" on this one. It needs to be firmly shut down. Best to just not talk about it at all. I agree with their approach
84. Mansfield MP Corrine McMillan labour block few people from block few residents from Mansfield, Mt Gravatt, Mt Gravatt East and Upper Mt Gravatt regarding about roads issues.
85. It's okay. They won't take away your ability to kill unborn humans.
86. Robbie Katter on election coverage live last night said he would still “test the parliament” on abortion rights, whatever that means. So it’s coming. Let’s see is David will keep his promise, or resign also as promised.
87. Can't imagine Amanda Stoker is capable of keeping her mouth shut about it for very long.
88. What's fucking wild to me is that the kids that don't get aborted are probably going to be the ones doing 'youth crime' in 10-15 years, so why the fuck would you get rid of it?
89. and as a member they're perfectly entitled to. This the democracy we live in Whether or not it gets up in another question. and if it gets up (which I highly doubt it will) the next Labor lead govt will undoubtably sort that out.
90. Welcome to Little Texas boys and girls! Hold on to yer britches coz we gonna go real fast on this here downhill...til we hit the bottom that is.
91. when he rolled his eyes and said "I guess I'll answer this for the hundredth time..." and then gave a waffling vague answer... wanker
92. I can’t believe it’s up for discussion again, surely it was debated intensely when it was legalised years ago!
93. If I need an abortion and this fuck head stops me I'm giving birth to that thing in his yard and leaving it in the mailbox. If he wants it he can have it.
94. Ironically, an LNP majority might turn out to be a saving grace here if the libs don't need to entertain Katter to get other stuff over the line. Depends what their focus groups tell them I suppose
95. Except in his answer he literally said its a low priority for him. He listed all of the constructive things he planned on pushing for agrarian North Queensland, and then said "I've said I'll test the parliament on abortion, so I'll do that. I don't know what that might look like, I haven't thought about it or even planned on it for this election, it just came up. It's not a priority, getting dams built so farmers don't run out of water, and fixing roads so people aren't cut off for 4 months of the year is my priority".
