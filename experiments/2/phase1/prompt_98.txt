Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. I legitimately forgot that the roar / a league exists here. I'll put that down to social circles I'm part of, but still, I live pretty close to the Gabba and hear nothing about it. Maybe tax payers aren't interested?
2. As they should. If it’s ok for league, rugby, afl and cricket, it should be for football.
3. This.... and the fact that the owners come across as part time owners with no money
4. The Bakries absolutely need to fuck off and never come back, theyve burnt way too many bridges with any possible tenants within a 200km radius of here.
5. This is a pretty common opinion amongst the Roar fans, especially the long running ones dating back to Roarcelona.
6. They've stated that this would be money coming from the rent they would normally pay to rent Suncorp. About 2 million a year.
7. Nah it’s not you, the A-league is terrible at publicity and media. Hard to watch or follow casually. Also, the roar seem to suck and have had a rotating series of managers and nothing very interesting going on.
8. Yes have governments have time and time again invested in stadiums for sports teams look at Springfield Stadium, Dolphins Stadium. The big difference is that the sports teams stumped at some cash to contribute. You're are a lot more likely to receive money from the government if you put your money on the table instead of just going out, begging for money and playing the victim. As one of Australia's largest pariticpation sports, soccer should have no trouble filling stadiums. But for some reason they haven't been able to convert their participation into viewership and that's a problem they need to address. Probably isn't helped by a significant number of their small following thinking it's ok to throw buckets at people's heads.
9. Sure, but it means the headline is a bit misleading isn’t it? It was also unclear from the article why they need a brand new stadium instead of making use of Ballymore. The poor public transport argument doesn’t really hold water imo.
10. But the qld govt already gets that rent for an existing asset. So Bakries aren’t putting anything on the table. Absolutely no incentive for the qld govt to invest.
11. Ok so they’re going to borrow $10million to fund it upfront? Or move in at the current stage and progressively upgrade fit over 5 years? The roar don’t own Perry Park, are they assuming there’s gonna be no upkeep costs, maintenance costs or rent due? A Facility like Perry Park has some significant ongoing upkeep costs, it also has no corporate facilities which make up a significant portion of profit margins for match-day income
12. Honestly, the public transport is abysmal. I found that out trying to get there on PT last year. 1.5 km walk from the nearest train station (Wilston). Makes it very difficult to get to if you have a mobility issue, young kids, or are elderly (especially as the A-League is played in summer). That walk is brutal. There's a few buses, but no where near enough to transport 7-10k people. There's also, quite literally, nothing to do nearby. It's a fully residential area. No pubs, no restaurants, nothing.
13. Is there any pubs or restaurants nearby Perry Park though? It’s a lot cheaper to put on more bus services than build a brand new stadium too.
14. There's newstead which is not too far away. But the land around Perry Park could also use the stadium as the catalyst to redevelop that whole area. The line of businesses along the train line could be redeveloped as mixed use apartments for example. And there's plenty of single family homes and low density businesses that could be upzoned Bowen Hills station is right there. Use it
15. Perry Park is close to Newstead and the Valley and in an area that is a light industrial and a 'priority development area'. Brekky creek hotel down isn't too far away either. I think you'd see some more development in terms of services should a stadium redevelopment occur. Putting more buses on may help, but if you want to move (lets say) 7,000 people - that's about 100 additional bus trips (max capacity 65). Whereas 7 trains could do the same amount of people - and those trains already run to Bowen Hills (120 metres from Perry Park). I do believe the plan is to go modular to keep costs down (a new stand ~50 million) and to seek funding from other private groups too (Football Queensland, private business interests). I personally would like to see the QLD government put in money to help with that. They've given millions to help fund upgrades for Brighton Homes arena (a pure AFLW stadium) and the Ipswich Jets (not even an NRL side). With the Olympics coming up they could help solve part of their infrastructure dilemma by helping build a much needed Tier II stadium in Brisbane.
16. I think the current strain on housing would be more of a driver to rezone/redevelop the area than a new stadium for the roar who struggle to attract crowds. I’m assuming there is a reason it’s not really been developed already - Is it all flood prone around there?
17. thanks to u/MajorTiny4713 for sharing this before - report to our swiss bank to receive your standard payment in gold and jewels out of the Queensland environment movement's secret accounts if anyone has any questions about the scorecard drop them below and I'll try and get sensible answers from the relevant experts in the team we've been handing these out at pre-polling in the City, Mansfield, Aspley, Clayfield, and we'll have everyone out on Saturday for the big day. Say hi if you see us! https://preview.redd.it/17xynpvq2gwd1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=285180b747dea73c533ae3cf8c4b85ee6a5625e1
18. Probably need this reference when they start saying reduction by 75% so need to know what is actually in the emissions. The data being confidential until recently is a bit of a problem that was not spoken about, that would have been good to know earlier. [https://www.energyandclimate.qld.gov.au/climate/climate-analytics-reporting/emissions-data](https://www.energyandclimate.qld.gov.au/climate/climate-analytics-reporting/emissions-data)
19. Hey QCC, have any parties updated their policies since you released this scorecard?
20. Giving Labor B+ is ridiculous. They should be D and LNP should he F-
21. Scorecard on policies is nice but I would like to see a scorecard on implemented policies and programs in their local electorate. You can promise the world but don't do it locally where you have control.
22. Most people in this forum are Labour public servants with enough free time to post the same article every hour for the last month.
23. >if anyone has any questions about the scorecard drop them below and I'll try and get sensible answers from the relevant experts in the team Great job all, this scorecard is a really insightful tool. Regarding questions on the scorecard and impacts, how much consideration was put toward [issues ](https://australiainstitute.org.au/post/report-fire-ants-to-kill-6-queenslanders-and-cost-households-188-million-annually-if-not-eradicated/)around Fire Ants in Australia? Particular focus on the [Recommendations ](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Rural_and_Regional_Affairs_and_Transport/FireAnts/Report)from a 2024 Senate Inquiry as well as [protecting areas and wildlife](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/sep/13/fire-ants-queensland-daisy-hill-koala-sanctuary-neville-lawrie-reserve)?
24. >if anyone has any questions about the scorecard drop them below and I'll try and get sensible answers from the relevant experts in the team I have question: what the HELL is up with the jpeg compression?
25. No worries fam, sorry for stealing your thunder! My post reached over a 100K users so thanks for doing the work to inform the people on environment 👏🫶 All parties have room to improve. Although this might prove impossible for any party beholden to corporate donations…
26. There have been some minor announcements but nothing that has moved the needle enough to bump scores up or down
27. This is ridiculous because only the government implements policies. Instead you could research the policies that work around the work or read the research by peak bodies like QCC. Great Britain has closed their last coal mine yet Queensland alone has approved 37 since 2015 and there are 38 currently awaiting approvals. This ‘implemented’ business is BS.
28. Thanks very much! Great question around fire ants. We don't do much with invasive species - we've worked with the Invasive Species Council on things, and some of our member groups specialise in this (shout out to Trevor and his team at [Cape York Weed and Feral Animals](https://cywafa.com.au/)) We're a relatively small org - 15ish staff - so for now our wildlife focus is on protecting natives and particularly threatened species.
29. No problem at all, it was great to see someone beat us to it! Always nice to know your work is getting out there in the world and people are engaging with it. Thanks for the stat as well, it's nearly end-of-month reporting time and I'll make sure to drop that in
30. Although I should add that there’s just one party in Brisbane that’s funding initiatives from their own salaries. Max Chandler Mather has fed 30,000 school kids from his own salary. Stephen Bates has a community grants program set up from his. Jonathan Sriranganathan donated half of his salary to community programs as Councillor.
31. If ya don’t report it, it will most likely not get fixed. I use Snap Send Solve app. It is fast and easy and every pot hole I have reported has been fixed within a week. https://preview.redd.it/4puk91t8pfwd1.jpeg?width=826&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5e7c1b498005b295900413d994a13716f1d6136c
32. I dare say Brisbane roads are far better than the roads you come from !!
33. Report them. If it’s a BCC road they are usually pretty quick to attend.
34. Have you never visited Port Stephens council region? There's some pretty bad places around, and Brisbane is pretty good compared to how bad it can be
35. If you think the roads are bad, you should check out the footpaths.
36. Yep, and completely opposite for footpaths and cycling paths. Report, wait five years. Unless it is an LNP chum speaking to majority LNP councillor, nothing. Crickets 🦗
37. We looked at buying in Tugun because it was so much cheaper than other suburbs but the plane noise ended up being a deal breaker. Some bloke at one inspection brought a decibel reader that said it was 90+ decibels
38. Tugun is nice. Quiet enough, periodically loud due to being beneath a flight path, but the demograph is solid and it's got plenty of cafes close by.
39. Absolutely zero chance of taking off anytime soon. everthing is already ridiculously overpriced there. And to top it off, you live under a flight path, that'll kybosh any plans of "taking off." As for the m1 yea good luck with that stewarts rd is an absolute clusterfuck at the best of times which in turn, will kybosh any plans on just going for a quick drive down the rd. Tugun at best, is used as a detour suburb to get to other places that aren't tugun. If it was back in early 2000's I'd say yes, now no chance the appeal has been sucked out of that place like a cheap hooker, which you'll prob see walking on occasion from hungry jacks to kirra.
40. I live up the back of tugun and dont really hear the planes anymore. Only hear them when Im down in the actual flight path on golden four drive.
41. Hey mate. I just moved her about 3ish months ago with my partner and we love it. Moved down from brissy but both of us are from NSW. Super close to the beach, just outside all the busy areas but close enough to still go on the weekends. Planes aren’t too bad over your house or apartment. Close to local shops and restaurants. All in all we think it’s amazing here
42. If you’re sensitive to noise, the planes are definitely loud. But, I love going to visit the cafes there, lots of great local spots.
43. Even if you're directly under the flight path, you honestly get used to it and don't even notice it after a while. Outside of the path and it's not bad at all. Tugun is probably the last reasonably priced suburb close to the beach. It's a good place to be.
44. Still has a bit of a village feel, but better if you're deaf.
45. There is a couple of them mate, I work in one and opposite another of them. Feel free to message me if you'd like
46. The hymix gravel quarry does not have any appreciable effect on air quality. It does blast every Wednesday, which shakes the earth and scares the shit out of you until you become used to it. The machinery noise has increased noticeably in the past year.
47. Lot of apologists here, it would seem. Probably employees of the quarry. 😂 The one at Oxenford has been under serious scrutiny the last few years as it most definitely has had an effect on local air quality, not to mention quality of life for nearby residents. Fact is, there is no way a quarry should continue to be operated in a residential area. Perhaps years ago when these suburbs weren't as populous as they are now it might have been excused, but the health risk for residents now outweighs the necessity for these operations. Anyone saying otherwise believes profits take precedence over people's health.
48. Lived in paccas for 20 years, you won't notice the Quarry. It's purpose is to Quarry. It does nothing to the air quality. You forget it's there if you don't work in it.
49. If building was approved near it then air quality isn’t an issue. It wouldn’t have been built there otherwise.
50. Just a question, do they operate overnight at all? I swear some nights I wake up a bed I can feel rumbling like from heavy machinery but it’s so faint I can’t actually hear it. I only hear it some nights at like 2 or 3am
51. I lived in the area for 20 years, never once noticed blasting, lol.
52. They sought and got an approval from council for extra truck movements commencing at 0600 instead of 0700. I think this approval ends at the end of this or next month.
53. Mine shuts at 5pm Monday through Friday and Noon on Saturday. The others do too. You may be hearing work on the Coomera connect works
54. Can't compare to 15 years ago, been here for 7. I moved up from Adelaide, so even if it's worse than it was, it's better than Adelaide. Lol
55. Has the Gold Coast changed? Absolutely, as a kid in the 80s growing up on the GC it was drastically different to what it is today, but unlike most I just accept this is the modern world and got to change with the times. Maybe it's just where I live, but I bought my house in 2007 and not much has changed around me too drastically, except the house prices significantly different, but I live walking distance to the water and enjoy it here, I lived here my whole life so I am biased. As for work it really does depend on what you do, as a paramedic I have never had to change job's thankfully, yes traffic is bad in spots, especially since I spend most of my day navigating traffic on the GC. The reality is the Gold Coast is no different to any city, got the good, the bad and the ugly!
56. Redditors love to complain so let me say this: yes the population has shot up so the traffic has assuredly gotten worse; however, the GC still has those laidback vibes and if you live near the beach, it still feels like you’re on holidays even when you live here. You get out of it what you make of it. I love the place.
57. I would definitely not recommend commuting to Brisbane everyday. The morning and afternoon traffic is horrendous. However, if you find a job on the Gold Coast, you’ll settle in nicely. Nothing much has changed except more population, a few extra high rises and some renos here and there. The food scene here is better than compared to twenty years ago too.
58. Here's my perspective: I'm 40, moved to the GC in 86 when I was two, went to St. Kevin's and St. Michael's for schooling. Lived in Carrara/Nerang/Highland Park for 99% of that time, moved away for better opportunities, or to get away from my friends and make something of myself, depending on how you look at it. I joined the Army, got an electronics trade and leveraged that for all it was worth and never said no to anything in that time. In 2013 I got out of the Army and started a company in Perth with some friends. I moved to Newcastle in 2020 when Covid kicked of because the business was big enough for me to do that and I didn't want to get stuck in WA with a 18 month old and not have family support, thanks to the borders closing. We stayed in Newey for two years until it was time for my daughter to start school. We moved back to the GC at the end of 2022 and it's one of the best moves I've made; this place feels like home and I'm content. All that said, there's not much chance that I could live the life I live now if I didn't get out of the GC. I think it's a great place to grow up and to settle down, but, I think it's a terrible place to set yourself up for success. As far as now vs back then goes, for the people that haven't ever left, there's the endless traffic and congestion, for those of us that have moved around, traffic is worse for sure, but, traffic is worse everywhere. Opportunities seem to be better and so too is the infrastructure. If I could do it again I wouldn't change a thing for me.
59. Blow ins everywhere! Melbourne and Sydney tradies have fucked over all the local chippies. Every house with a reasonable size block is torn down and replaced with duplexes. Traffic is fucked, even Bermuda St gets backed up now. I used to drive from mermaid to burleigh for work in 7 minutes. It’s atleast 15-30 these days. Tram has fucked the Gold Coast Highway. Since covid everyone is so far up their ass, cashed up interstaters are cooked. But I wouldn’t move anywhere else, born and raised and will hopefully raise a family here. Still lots of positives but they are my main cons
60. The traffic is terrible here now. I’m at the southern end and we moved down this end because it is quieter but now going to the beach is a mission unless you are walking distance. Be prepared to buy yourself an electric bike because parking gets mental. A lot of people commute from as far as Kingscliff to Brisbane to work and with the tram works heading down this way it is only going to get crazier. Most schools are capped now because of over population but the standard is definitely better than it was. The infrastructure has not kept up with the influx of people moving here. Having said this it is still a stunning place to live if you can sort out schooling and commuting.
61. I think you summed it up accurately in your last point, just because somewhere is good for a holiday doesn’t necessarily make it a great place to live.
62. Less places to park for a day at the beach (paid parking), dogs in cafes sniffing around the place, a large proportion of the population actually working in Brisbane (or so it seems by the M1) and then there's the traffic.
63. Do NOT move back here with kids that young! It’s shit!
64. OG born and bred here… traffic is insane now. When making a decision on where to live please take the commute into account during peak hour. Since the influx of Southerners from 2020, my daily commute has gone from 10 minutes to on a good day 20 minutes but often longer. There’s a lot for kids to do here, both free and paid. It’s actually a great place to raise kids with the big council owned open spaces and great playgrounds. Locals theme park passes and sporting options. The APS private schools are highly competitive to get into but most Catholic schools are still fairly ok to get into. As alumni you should take priority. There are social issues in every town in Australia, the GC is no different but as someone who used to live here you will be shocked at how prevalent the homeless are in areas like Southport and the beach suburbs. More mental health issues on public transport. Having not lived anywhere else it’s hard to know if it’s been a dramatic increase just on the GC or if this is just a reflection across all of Australia. We have great shopping centres now like Pac Fair and Robina Town Centre. As for jobs there’s a lot more opportunity now but Brisbane will always have more opportunities.
65. Unless you find work that is a short commute from where you want to live, be prepared for the shit-show that is Gold Coast-Brisbane traffic. The traffic situation is just munted. I've been here since 1990, and can't wait to escape. I think you could find much better places to live.
66. As someone who has also lived in both Newy and the Gold Coast, stay in Newy.
67. I remember when Varsity was a swamp. I haven't lived on the Gold Coast since 2016, though. Most of my maternal family lives there still. They say traffic is the biggest change. Better restaurants. Sightly better public transport. Lots of the same vibes just more people. Does Robina Town Centre still have that stupid giant rock ball water feature? Does Big Chief still exist?
68. Up until January this year, I lived on the Gold Coast for 12 years. I left because the population exploded with covid refugees from the southern states. Crime went through the roof and the roads are clogged. The M1 is carpark every day because there is an accident every day.
69. Left in 2013, go back to visit family, will never live there again. Population density, traffic is much worse. The only reason to live there is the beach, and if you can there a plenty better places to live near a beach without the aggressiveness and general fuckwitery
70. Moved down from Brisbane about 20 years ago. It was a lot more quiet then, even prior to Covid. Covid + the Olympics + Northern suburbs coming online has definitely made it much more crowded and more angrier place to live. I find I stick in my local area more now just because traffic is a bitch. Hopefully better public transport follows because the geographic constraints of the beach and hinterland means we cant keep adding more roads.
71. The answers to all these are so highly subjective as to be completely useless. Like, the GC is a big place, and the gym/tan/tattoo thing has never been a thing where I live. If you have a good job and enjoy where you live, why would you want to move?
72. Left GC in 97 to Sydney and back in 2020. The food options are much better now, although no more Sizzler :) but you have many more options than just fish and chips, Chinese or Marie's pizza. But I work from home so commute is not an issue and the few times I've driven to Brisbane is annoying. But compared to Sydney seems same amount of traffic BS. Just used to be much breezier.
73. Everything has grown in that time, more people, more traffic, more expensive, more shops, more busy. If you can live close to where you work, school and shop then things are pretty sweet. If you need to commute to Brisbane for work the traffic sucks. If you want to go to the beach all the time and can’t walk the parking sucks. It’s still a great place to live and raise a family, it’s just a lot busier and more expensive than it used to be.
74. It’s gym/tan/tattoo/reality tv/influencer/ get on the bag kinda place now
75. Depends on where you live I guess. We recently moved from Currumbin, into a unit on Pacific Parade in Bilinga. It is so much like the old Goldie around that area, although Kirra is starting to go to shit. Cooly is still pretty old school. All the Southerners that have moved to Palmy etc, constantly complain about the crime etc. I say bring back the old days where there was a dealer on most corners, and that would make all of the newbies fuck off lol.... I absolutely love living here. It takes me under 10 minutes to get to work, and I dont have to deal with the M1 at all. Its what you make of it.
76. I guess it depends what you do for work as far as the work things goes really you want to compare GC to Newy more then GC to old GC don't you ? Some great answers here already. The tattoos and bimbos thing is an inaccurate cliche. Most of GC is suburbia . There's more taking the kids to soccer practice than doing pingas for most of us
77. Wife was born there I grew up there , Moved away from there 10 yrs ago to the Northern Rivers. We go back often as family still there. After an hour there , we want to GTFO of there
78. FYI2: 2024 Sunshine Coast is probably the 2010s gold coast you want
