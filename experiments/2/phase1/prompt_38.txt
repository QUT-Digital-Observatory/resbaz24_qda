Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Please keep in mind this is anecdotal evidence from a few teacher mates spread through SEQ and NQ. It's worse up north with my mate in Townsville having a couple kids in his class that consistently come to school with no lunch, the guys down south and out west see it more sporadically but it's always at least a couple through their classes over the week. The kids up in Townsville without lunches are also the ones that are acting up in class and getting in trouble at school.
2. so you think it's funny to stick the boot into people who are worried about the future. nice one I hope your life improves now "Labour" are out lol
3. Agree about union bosses earning 1M. Still not convinced about unions dictating a project. How? What? Slow purposeful slow downs? Or just standing up for an achievable schedule in the face of a naive and clueless client/management about realistic schedules and timelines.
4. Looks like I’m the only winner in this sub today then. I’ll take it.
5. Idiots down south? You mean australians…? You mean the daughter trying to see her dying father who was stuck at the border when he died…? You mean queenslanders who couldnt come home…? Great leadership. How can you run a state when youre scared of a cold? We’ll let the footy players in though. Idiot
6. That's the secret, economic conservatism is a valid political principle and is pretty much followed by the ALP. LNP don't have a political philosophy to speak of, they're just influence peddling grifters.
7. You questioned whether ‘people who don’t even know what they’re putting on their forms’ should be voting. Probably most of them aren’t particularly informed but some of those are genuinely convinced they do. Is it really better to kill off the vote of an apathetic person to give weight to one who is deranged or seeks to boost the interests of people/parties who would actively harm the rights of select groups of people if they were to gain power? And some apathetic voters who might have an inkling can be manipulated by a shitty media into not voting, convinced that they won’t make a difference. It’s a terrible idea on many levels. I’ve definitely got sympathy for the idea that some people are too stupid to be allowed to vote, but the reality we are operating within should give you no faith in the concept of optional *or* restricted voting on this basis.
8. Oh, so you're just disingenuous, could've said that a while ago and saved my time.
9. You know QLD branch went through a royal commission right? They came out clean. I assume you knew that as you are acting like you know everything?
10. They probably would have before, too. My partner and his brother work trades and a lot of their colleagues love Trump (including BIL). I’d be shocked if they voted Labor based on that alone.
11. "get employed as a contractor making heaps more" what the fuck hahaha so this person has the skills to negotiate a higher pay than they're currently getting? using what leverage? why did they not do it before being booted? like what the fuck are you talking about lmfao I really hope you continue this conversation so I can tease the realisation out of you that you have no idea how the job market works
12. Like how in most other states there is a fee for calling the ambulance?
13. I had no clue we already had one I've tried to find one before. I thought it was private for the offenders safety
14. Firstly we are not talking about gender affirmation surgery. Secondly, did you read the methodology of this study? The design is terrible. I'm not sure I would even pass an undergrad assignment with this. You can't compare people who underwent vasectomy or tubal ligation (or no surgery) who are not identifiable as transgender (many straight and cis gender people would be in this comparison group, if not the majority) with people who have undergone gender affirming surgery and are transgender. This research is large but doesn't actually tell us anything about suicide risk pre and post gender affirming surgery in transgender individuals as the title implies. The only conclusion that could be drawn from it could be that transgender individuals have a higher suicide risk that the general population which, duh. Edit: here is a systematic review collating several studies that includes more appropriate control groups and comparisons. Unsurprisingly, gender affirming surgery lead to a decrease, but it was still higher than the general population controls. Who would have thought people politicising and stigmatising your very existence would have a negative impact on your mental health. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/26318318231189836 Please don't cherry pick studies to support your agenda without carefully assessing them first.
15. Context is important here. They're talking about Children. Trans youth under 18 *very* rarely undergo bottom surgery except for ultra specific unique-to-individual cases
16. https://i.redd.it/a9ul1zo3evtc1.jpeg They can say all they want in the FAQ, read the actual study and you can see that they -absolutely- rejected studies for these reasons.
17. I’m sorry but no one is transphobic. It’s propaganda instilled in people to further create division and encourage classist warfare by the deep state elite. Battle of the sex’s, races, genders etc- are completely artificial and I will not be a mouth piece for which that I protest. I love you, although I don’t know you, and I respect you. I don’t care who you like, or who you marry; I believe you have value and are worthy of love and acceptance. What people are phobic towards is government agenda. Similar to uncanny valley; people just don’t like having doctrine shoved down their throat. You don’t call an atheist religious-phobic; but I can guarantee you there’s atheists out there who get a bad rub from watching a show and having lots of religious cues or hidden agenda etc. throughout. You and I might not care, but they do; and it doesn’t mean they’re religion-phobic; it’s just they get a strange knee jerk reaction due to their predisposition so programming - which they can’t be blamed for, just like no one else can- these predispositions are mostly societally constructed and for purpose- purpose being division. Also some understand corporations and government and media are pushing narratives - and NEVER ONCE have these governments or groups pushed a narrative where it was completely and utterly selfless, and everyone gained but themselves. No, they do it for their own gain; and dividing us is part of that. So long as we fight amongst eachother, call eachother names, trumper, magas, Kamala’s, blue team, red team, transphobic, cishet, dumb bitch, beta male; So long as we continue to play their game and fight eachother, the longer we play their game and lose, together. Better to stand up and join together; than succumb together. ❤️
18. Not propaganda, ironic of you you to say that though- considering it’s only mentioned on clearly biased websites. Here is the study that goes over 30 years and proves this to be true. It’s horrible, but it’s also a mental illness and should handled with care and not affirmation. I say this as someone with a trans sibling and cousins. This issue is very close to my heart, and sadly this is very much the case. You do not affirm the ramblings of someone who is going through psychosis and delusions of grandeur- this is a really cruel thing that we have tried to normalise. It’s very easy to sit there and agree with it when it’s not happening to you/your family. Trust me, I now know the difference. https://issuepedia.org/2011/02/22/Long-Term_Follow-Up_of_Transsexual_Persons_Undergoing_SRS I fear as time goes on and we get more longitudinal studies, we will be even more alarmed at the barbarity we are committing on kids right now; like this study which says children under 18 are the HIGHEST rates of suicide in the trans community: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10027312/ so here’s a shoutout to the corporations and political parties taking advantage of our suffering; LEAVE OUR KIDS ALONE.
19. I’m pretty sure, that you “knew” your gender at an early age. And it seems like you hit the jackpot and your outward sexual physical attributes match that idea of your self. Gender and sex are so complicated. There is a significant amount people who feel apathetic to gender, who strongly feel they have a particular gender or no gender. And there are plenty of people in the world who have chromosomes, or internal organs, different to the gender they live as, or hormones different to their assigned gender and they have no idea. You could be one of those and just not know.
20. Your study doesn't come to the conclusion you do and you have misunderstood it. It's assessing suicide risk overtime throughout treatment, not before and after treatment or the risk of having treatment vs not having treatment. Did you actually read the study? You really don't have to read far to realise that you have misunderstood this lol.
21. Nope it's basically being seen as a ring road for north Brisbane residents to access the Sunshine Coast without going into the Bruce because of the bottlenecks through bald hills, Nudgee, North lakes that have existed since Joseph played fullback for Jerusalem. You can tell why the community is up in arms, right?
22. Do you think that if a criminal is put behind bars, another one spawns in its spot and commits the crimes that the first one would have done? Lol. They aren't limitless lemmings, they can be stopped from committing crimes.
23. Your first paragraph makes a fair point, I’m not saying LNP are better on this front, that’s a separate issue. I was just making the point parents should be providing lunch for their kids, not the tax payers.
24. I will take your word for it because life is a lot harder these days than it was when I was a kid, so I can see this as a possibility, especially with the cost of living crisis.
25. I've seen projects halted because the union didn't think enough trees were being planted (that's between the developer and council). I've seen projects halted because the wrong bottled water was being offered. I've seen projects halted because the union didn't think the end colour was right. Unions are there to keep the workers safe and fairly paid. I will never disagree with that.
26. I know. Imagine asking that question and then people getting riled up over an answer that was on par with it. Almost as bad as getting worked up and hysterical about an election result.
27. The footy players quarantined when they came in. Queenslanders could return if they did the quarantine/had any mental discipline to do it. And yeah just cause they're Australians doesn't mean they aren't dumb or selfish. Yes that was really sad about the daughter with her dying father and was a really shit situation but there would've been a lot more funerals if we just let covid run its course before the vaccine. Also if NSW wasn't scared of "a cold" why did one of NSW's lockdowns last 107 days
28. That was not me questioning that was someone else, I simply replied - please read carefully. Is it really a meaningful vote if you include people who voted “because they have the cutest name”? I think this is an interesting topic to have an open discussion about - you should not be so close minded.
29. Yes, deaths at work should be prevented. Shame union officials care more about their own pockets than safety.
30. You can work a trade without being a union member. I can assure you that the union comes to site and strongly advise you who to vote for. Most rank and file members vote for who they are told to vote for. I was a PKIU, BLF and CFMEU member since I was 14. I’ve seen and done all the union have to offer.
31. Because there was no nice contracting position. It was a full time position. C'mon dude. Are you reading what I say?
32. OK, so you believe yourself to be in a position to design a better study? Sorry, but I put odds at less than 50% for that. And of course we are talking about the same thing. Step one is to interfere with hormones.
33. As the FAQ notes, it would be unethical to have the patients being treated not being aware about their treatment. This makes it unethical to perform and therefore unreasonable to discount studies for not being a double blind design. However, the blindness in question is about the patient being blind the treatment. The CASS report notes the other forms of blindness: > The term blind or blinded is used in RCTs. There are different levels of blinding: firstly, **if researchers are doing the assessments, they should not know which group a patient has been allocated to**. Secondly, the patient can be blinded so that they do not know if they are on the new treatment or the original treatment, or even on a placebo (dummy pills). Finally, the treating doctor (or team) should ideally be blind to the group allocation, so their treatment of the patients does not differ. The image you provide appears to be a screenshot form the [NICE evidence review](https://segm.org/sites/default/files/20210323_Evidence%2Breview_Gender-affirming%2Bhormones_For%2Bupload_Final_download.pdf#page=98). If you look at the detailed analysis of the first report in that list you'll find the lack of blinding is expanded as "assessors not blinded to treatment". The studies are being considered lower quality study because the *assessors* were not blinded to the treatment condition. Without that blinding it remains possible for the researchers bias to compromise the results. It is not unethical to blind the researchers in that situtation. This is significantly different to the claim about them being dismissed for not being double blind.
34. Your first link is comparing the general population with transgender population. We already know there is a higher risk of mental health issues in transgender population. This study is meaningless as it doesn't assess pre and post treatment (of any kind) among transgender individuals. You can't draw conclusions based on that. Your second link may find that there is an increased risk in children, but it also found an overall decrease and need to obtain more data - which is reasonable. You can't take one part and ignore all the other findings. I'm not getting any information from "clearly" biased websites. I have hands on experience, and a scientific background that gives me a good grounding in assessing the evidence available and the risks vs benefits. There is no conspiracy here as you imply, practitioners are trying to help people and right now people's lives are being politicised leading to more hurt. But you do you, I don't care.
35. > However, the suicide risk in transgender people is higher than in the general population and seems to occur during every stage of transitioning.
36. Yep. I would've thought that improving the nudgee bottleneck would be worth it more. I know the land around there is shit and swampy, but surely they could just like, expand that fucker into 8 lanes for about 20km and let it narrow down.
37. Erm yes, that’s exactly how it works. Jailing people (especially children) doesn’t prevent crime. That’s facts, friend. Poverty causes youth crime. Child abuse causes youth crime. Male violence causes youth crime. Jailing the product of the issues does not solve the problem. Personally I’m sick of men murdering women daily, but peoples belongings are much more important because fuck dem kids, right?
38. I can't comment on those specific instances and that sounds pretty egregious, but this hasn't been my experience.. I have seen examples of workers doing the right things, In spite of clients and management saying otherwise, because it saves people's bacon in the end. I have also seen unions used as an excuse for failed project delivery, despite all evidence to the contrary.
39. As a "rank and file" member, they may suggest, but ultimately people vote for who they want regardless.
40. The Miles Govt had an 'advisory panel' where they would 'consult' with the CFMEU on construction projects ie the union ran the Govt & essentially told Labor what construction companies would get the lucrative contracts at ridiculously inflated prices.
41. "making heaps more" I just assumed you weren't dumb and were taking into account that contractors must pay their own super and tax. either the monetary value of the remuneration package is higher after rehiring as a contractor, in which case why the fuck did they not use the leverage before, or the value of the remuneration package is lower after rehiring as a contractor, in which case: that's my point. The public service pays more to contractors in recognition that they actually save money by not having additional obligations to that worker like super, time off, employee benefits etc.
42. Absolutely. Undergraduate in biomedical science, post graduate in clinical physiology and at the pointy end of an MD in addition to work experience in the area. Nearly 8 years of having study design drilled into me does give me a pretty solid grounding to at the very least, recognise glaring flaws in studies, lol. And no, not the same thing at all. Hormone treatments are often the full extent of gender affirming care for many people and they will never have surgery. If you didn't spend all your time cherry picking dubious studies to confirm your preconceived notions - you might actually learn something new about the people's lives you are politicising for no good reason.
43. Repeating yourself doesn't make it any more true, if they weren't including control groups as one of their metrics, why did they bring it up so frequently? > The studies are being considered lower quality study because the assessors were not blinded to the treatment condition. Without that blinding it remains possible for the researchers bias to compromise the results. It is not unethical to blind the researchers in that situtation. This is significantly different to the claim about them being dismissed for not being double blind. Not in all studies, they would need to lay out the reasoning as to how it led to the results being influenced, it doesn't automatically make a study lower quality. That's an extremely unscientific way to assess research. For something like what they're discussing, it would be a difficult argument to make that the researcher being aware of of the situation would lead to bias having any impact upon the results, especially given the very noticeable and measurable results in a lot of the areas that the studied covered.
44. They should leave our kids alone. I’m not arguing over semantics; if we argue - they win. Fuck them for pitting us against eachother.
45. Yes, occurs at similar rates *during* their treatment *at the clinic* in the study. This doesn't mean it doesn't change *after* transitioning, it doesn't mean it isn't reduced from *before* starting to transition, and it doesn't prove causation because the study did not even look at those differences, so cannot draw those conclusions. It only proves that trans individuals are at a higher risk compared to the general population (which we know), and *this risk does not significantly change throughout their treatment*. The conclusion was that it is important to provide appropriate support to handle this risk - not deprive people of treatment that is proven in other, more appropriately designed studies to increase quality of life and mental health outcomes. You represented it as not decreasing *after* transitioning. This study didn't even asses pre-treatment risk/occurrence, or post treatment risk/occurrence. You misrepresented it. You are entitled to your opinion. But do not use scientific literature to justify your views. You have proven yourself to not have the ability to analyse or truly understand the methodologies and findings of the study (This is not something that comes naturally simply by having access to journal articles), but you're digging your heels in anyway. I think there is a word for that...
46. I feel like you're not understanding what I'm saying just downvoting immediately so I'll try and give an example. Brian is a normal guy, lives in suburbia with his family and is quite unremarkable. Every couple of weeks, Brian gets his tools, car or belongings stolen. He sets up a camera and sees the local bogan, BraeDon is the one stealing his belongings. He reports BraeDon and the police give him a stern old talking to. The next week, he catches BraeDon again, stealing from his neighbour, Steve. The police give him a REAAAALLY stern talking to. Anyway, the next day BraeDon is caught again stealing from Sharon, down the road. This time, BraeDon's really in for it. No dessert and straight to bed stuff. He ends up getting the sternest of stern talkings to. Eventually this continues until BraeDon ends up in jail for accumulation of about 200 crimes. Suddenly, Brian's tools stop going missing. Steve's house stops being broken into. What do we think is the common denominator? Perhaps if BraeDon was in juvie/jail after incident 1, perhaps Steve and Sharon might not have had to be victims of crime at all. So was a crime prevented by locking him up? And if BraeDon wasn't around, there's no reason to think another criminal would have magically sprouted out of the ground to commit those same crimes in his absence. Yes, there are usually multiple criminals in an area, but it's unlikely that another would go to the same areas and commit those crimes on top of their own crimes just because BraeDon left a void of his potential crimes. The net result is the number of crimes would go down due to lack of freedom/opportunity. Would you apply the same logic of "well if they are in jail we'll still have the same crime anyway so what's the point" to serial killers or rapists? There are others out there so we should just leave Ted Bundy to it - he did have a REALLY SAD childhood after all. Plenty of kids grew up in poverty and suffered abuse and didn't turn out to be dregs of society.
47. There's def problems in all areas. I'm just saying if unions focused solely on the workers, it would avoid/reduce the delays you've seen, as well as what I have.
48. I have been on a site where everyone was told they are a useless cunt and an empty vessel if they don’t vote the way they are told, it’s not really suggestion. Never been involved in the union have you?
49. No I think we can take it as read that most people vote for who they are told. That’s why there’s always people out there front with the little bits of paper so you don’t forget between the car and the ballot box. Most Australians don’t want to vote and don’t want to know about politics, so they vote for the simplest reason they can find or be told.
50. I'm a contractor dude. Different industry but I know my shit. It is worth way more and when I demand it is worth even more. Emergency/breakdown work is even more again. It's for numbers on columns dude. It will cost us more. It has every time. Trust me. The only winner is the contractor.
51. That's just not true. Failing to avoid bias whenever possible is unscientific. Here's what [a general article on the topic](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8308085/) has to say: > We blind because the potential for bias is everywhere. Bias can take numerous shapes and forms when people involved in a research study are privy to information about the assigned interventions. ... Differential treatment, attention, or attitudes toward subjects by a non-blinded healthcare team or other members of the research staff also pose a major threat to unbiased outcomes. Importantly, once bias is introduced from any one of these potential sources, there exist no analytical techniques by which to reliably correct for this limitation. ... > Blinding of data collectors and outcome adjudicators (sometimes the same individuals) is crucial to ensure unbiased ascertainment of outcomes. ... Although subjective outcomes are most at risk of ascertainment bias, seemingly objective outcomes often require some degree of subjectivity and therefore are at risk of bias as well. ... > This rationale strongly suggests that the blinding of as many individuals as is practically possible limits bias in clinical trials.
52. Who is they? Edit: it's not semantics. You posted studies that didn't reflect your claims and Chery picked data. Not semantics but whatever.
53. Cute fanfiction you’ve written there - but it all relies on the (incorrect) assumption that youth crime exists in a vacuum, and that bad kids are a finite minority rather than created by poverty, abuse and violence. Evidence (FACTS mate, FACTS not emotional stories) shows us that jailing kids doesn’t prevent crime. Brian’s tools are still getting stolen. Brian should learn to lock up his shit, or vote for parties who want to prevent crime rather than charge me (the taxpayer) to jail children. Call me when we’re actually jailing adult men for their adult crimes. Until then, lay off the fucking children.
54. I'm a financial member of cfmeu currently. I admit I've only been a member for just over 4 years now, but can honestly say I've not had that level of "suggestion" put to me. Mostly it's some delo/organiser having a dribble about some shit, most seem uninterested unless it's a site closure. That was working at Queens Wharf with 2000+ workers onsite at peak.
