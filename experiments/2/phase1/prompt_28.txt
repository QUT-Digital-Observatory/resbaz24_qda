Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. A problem that doesn‚Äôt exist‚Ä¶ for YOU. This very well could be a problem for other people, you know, people who own a uterus. But it‚Äôs not a problem for you, so why should anyone care right? Everyone should just shut up and stay home and not share their thoughts about anything I guess. It makes me happy that you are so pissed about people protesting, makes me want to go block traffic even more. It‚Äôs pretty weird that you‚Äôve stalked me but I guess I hit a nerve and you couldn‚Äôt help yourself. Btw do you often get angry at lesbians online? Is it because you know they won‚Äôt fuck you? I‚Äôm not actually a lesbian I‚Äôm bisexual, but that has nothing to do with me advocating for stopping the genocide because unlike you I am capable of understanding that LGBT+ rights aren‚Äôt really issue No.1 when you are being bombed in your home. Anyway I hope you continue to be mad at lesbians and protests. You really do sound like a grumpy old boomer it‚Äôs quite funny
2. >If you seriously see a fetus in the same light as a two year old, you are insane, sure a healthy fetus has the potential to become a two year old, but so does the egg my body decides to pass every once in a while. There are scientific terms for many subtle stages of a baby's in utero development, that doesn't stop it from being a baby. A foetus is not the same as an unfertilised egg. The egg will only become a born child with action. The foetus will only die with action, unless there is a miscarriage. So in fact the chances are diametrically opposed.
3. Killing someone is not healthcare. It is only healthcare when a person with an illness or injury is being euthanised.
4. It doesn‚Äôt exist because they never said that and nor will do it. You cant help but make lies out of everything where is the anger at lesbians?? Mentioning the word lesbian apparently is received as a hate speech to the simple. And you‚Äôre no bisexual if no one wants you you‚Äôre just un lovable
5. hate to say it bud but the fetus can‚Äôt live independently, the mother has to take action to keep it alive, literally why there are so many health checkups involved with pregnancies and checking development and why things like diets, halting substance use, and physical activity are so important. obviously there is a difference between unfertilised eggs and fertilised eggs but still neither of them are a baby. *edit legally there isn‚Äôt life until the fetus can live independently from the mother, that isn‚Äôt my opinion that is the legal requirement for life in australia, can‚Äôt kill something that isn‚Äôt alive.
6. holy shit, you managed to contradict yourself in just 2 sentences, congrats! 'killing someone is not healthcare, except for when it is' is not the brilliant insight you clearly thought it was. it's actually kind of a pro-abortion argument when you think about it, lmfao. god, the forced-birther brains trust clearly isn't sending their best, huh?
7. I mean you‚Äôre the one fantasising about me getting stoned to death. And yet I‚Äôm the unlovable one ü§£ü§£ü§£
8. bTW you saying youre thinking about them stoning me to death was the hate speech, not the lesbian part. Its crazy how dumb you have to be to not realise that
9. The pregnancy healthcare stuff is just to minimize the risk of problems. If the mother does nothing but keep herself healthy, the baby will 100% be born unless there is a miscarriage. So, no action means a new life. Versus an unfertilized egg, where no action means no new life. You can't hide behind legal definitions, the law says all kinds of untrue things. [Legal fiction - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Legal_fiction&oldid=1245886902) And the law permits all kinds of awful things too.
10. **Did you read the explanatory notes of the amendment? You didn't did you lmao ill help you out, no one is forcing births or canceling any abortions.... This is soley regarding fetus' as you say independently living outside the mothers post abortion.... I.e not fetus but >Babies<** **"**babies born as a result of a termination of pregnancy procedure. babies born as a result of a termination of pregnancy procedure.**"** **"**The bill removes any doubt that babies **born in these circumstances** are entitled to the same degree of medical care and attention as a baby born in any other way.**"** >hate to say it bud but the fetus can‚Äôt live independently, the mother has to take action to keep it alive This is very true as by definition the fetus is inside the mother, once the fetus is outside its not a fetus, now its a baby. And idk what argument your making as independent life soley means the baby has taken a breath. Laymans independent living? well,... Yeah um you'd struggle to find even a 5 year old that could live independent. Without action taken from parents... You know that's why he have criminal neglect charges against parents, because children require external care and attention or they well they face horrible outcomes. >legally there isn‚Äôt life until the fetus can live independently from the mother Well Yes that means the baby inhales the atmosphere once outside the body of the mother. The *"Under Australian law, a life is recognised at the point when there is* [*independence from the mother*](https://www.judicialcollege.vic.edu.au/media/837/file)*. This means the child becomes a legal person when the child can take its first independent breath, otherwise known as the ‚Äúborn alive rule‚Äù."* **So what you're saying is you agree with LNP and think the following is morally abhorrent. I don't think you read the proposed concerns lmao as, All they desire is babies that are alive outside of the mother to not just be left to die, You're saying so much about the dangers of pregnancy et.c but these are no longer a risk to the mother as the fetus is now a premature living neonate desperately clinging to life and being left to die (as alive = alive\[I'd hope you wont change the alive definition now again\])** A known case of a pre-viable baby born alive and left to die in Queensland is that of Xanthe.6 Unexpectedly born alive at 19 weeks after an abortion at the Royal Brisbane and Women‚Äôs Hospital, Xanthe was left to die alone for seven minutes without being held.7 In 2018, a study reported in the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology reviewed 241 late-term abortions without feticide on babies between 20-24 weeks gestation and found that more than half the babies were born alive, with a median time of survival of 32 minutes and one baby surviving for over four hours (267 minutes).8 *6 Jackie Sinnerton, ‚ÄúHospital failures pushed my wife over the edge‚Äù, The Sunday Mail, 6 August 2023.* *7 Ibid.* *8 Stephanie Springer et al, ‚ÄòFetal Survival in Second-Trimester Termination of Pregnancy without Feticide‚Äô (2018) 131(3) Obstetrics & Gynaecology 575.* [*https://documents.parliament.qld.gov.au/tp/2024/5724T411-9FFD.pdf*](https://documents.parliament.qld.gov.au/tp/2024/5724T411-9FFD.pdf) Every argument you've made is quite literally irrelevant to the actual amendment lmao....
11. Healthcare only applies to the ill and injured. You understand this? It is not a difficult concept. To simply kill a perfectly healthy person is just the act of killing. It is not in any way healthcare. Serial killers are not doctors. Do you understand? There is no force involved in healthy consensually conceived pregnancies, and no healthcare involved in the killing of such babies. You cannot tell the truth about your position for the simple reason that your position is infanticidal. Take a good long hard look in the mirror. Think about what you have become.
12. I know this must be the most anyone has ever talked to you. But don‚Äôt worry its only because your personality sux. Good talk
13. law, and biology buddy. a women ‚Äúkeeping herself healthy‚Äù is taking action. an elite athlete choosing to have a baby is going to lead a very different lifestyle then she normally does, as would many different women from many different walks of life. my mother took the action to quite smoking when she was pregnant, many women stop drinking, avoid raw fish and certain foods. I know many women who had to be hospitalised in the lead up to their births for many different reasons, if they hadn‚Äôt acted and gotten medical intervention many of those fetus wouldnt have been born. i‚Äôm a twin, my brother and i were born months premature via C-section as my umbilical cord was wrapped around his throat and he was lacking vital nutrients without that medical intervention we both would have likely died, and my mother would have likely never been able to natural expel our remains. shows how very little you know of pregnancy to assume that 100% of women who lead healthy lives give birth to healthy babies (unless they have a miscarriage), thousands of premie babies die in the NICU after they are born from a plethora of different things, SIDs is a fairly common phenomenon, as are developmental defects that are never found in screenings or on scans. pregnant women are taking actions literally every step of their pregnancy, i don‚Äôt see how taking a pill to kill a bundle of cells that haven‚Äôt existed for more then a month is an action but choosing to have your body ripped apart months early to hopefully save one of your dying fetus isn‚Äôt, i feel sorry for your mother that you seriously think pregnancy is a walk in the park as long as you‚Äôre healthy üòí
14. Are you a doctor? Because I can assure you the 'healthcare stuff' is a lot more complicated than you think. There is no such thing as a free baby. The physiological changes during pregnancy are dramatic, and can exacerbate or reveal underlying health problems in the mother. Not to mention the innumerable potential pregnancy complications which can put the life of both mother and foetus at risk. Ever heard of preeclampsia? Placenta praevia? Massive post-partum haemorrhage? GBS infection? If you answered 'yes' then you would understand that no baby is guaranteed until they are pink and crying. Denying adequate healthcare and bodily autonomy based on an argument of 'babies just happen' is completely indefensible from a medical (or any educated) standpoint. If the answer was 'no', then maybe you have no clue what is and isn't safe in childbirth. And just maybe you should shut your mouth about things you don't understand.
15. A baby that doesn‚Äôt have severe medical issues will not die naturally in 32 minutes. Babies terminated because they have severe defects not compatible with life should be allowed minimal suffering and their parents should be allowed to hold them and love them for those 32 minutes, not have them taken away and given forceful measures and hooked up to machines that will only prolong suffering and not give them meaningful life (if they are born without part of their brain or no kidneys etc). Just as it is cruel to insist on rib breaking CPR for elderly cancer patients, who can say they Do not want these measures but want to die peacefully.
16. Oh I know it‚Äôs been a good talk for you because you‚Äôre fantasising about stoning me. Psychopath
17. If I had to guess you‚Äôre probably a lesbian who protests for Palestinians but if you went there they would stone you to death. How many times would you like me to read the part where you fantasise about me getting stoned to death?
18. >I know many women who had to be hospitalised in the lead up to their births for many different reasons, if they hadn‚Äôt acted and gotten medical intervention many of those fetus wouldnt have been born. Highly reliable sourced data set, I'm actually amazed that someone with so much concern about these laws seriously didn't take the fucking time to actually read the explanatory notes of the amendment. >i were born months premature via C-section as my umbilical cord was wrapped around his throat and he was lacking vital nutrients without that medical intervention we both would have likely died Whats wild is LNP are actually advocating for people in your situation essentially but instead it would be phrased without the "C-section" and with "termination", Unless you think once you were removed from your c-section and needed healthcare but your parent said "nah we not want" you should be excluded health care and left to die. (again not forcing the life onto a mother... but just providing medical care to a pre mature neonate; like you were once apon a time) *This Guideline stipulates that in instances where a ‚Äúbaby is born with signs of life and survival is determined to be unlikely,‚Äù the guidelines state that ‚Äúactive treatment‚Äù is not recommended. The Guideline suggests a range of other best practices including the establishment of ‚Äúlocal procedures for the management of live birth,‚Äù including offering counselling and other services to parents, handling the baby gently and wrapping to provide warmth and offering parents opportunities to engage in care provision such as cuddling/holding. If parents do not wish to be involved in palliative care provision, the Guidelines stipulate that healthcare providers ‚Äúmay provide comfort support strategies‚Äù.11* *While the present iteration of the Guideline is an improvement on the previous version which stipulated that ‚Äúif a live birth occurs‚Ä¶do not provide life-sustaining treatment‚Äù, there remain ambiguities which require addressing. First, if a live birth occurs following a termination and the baby has no life-limiting condition and is on the threshold of viability (ie. after 22 weeks and 6 days) or older, it should be clearly stipulated that life-sustaining medical care should be provided to the child irrespective of parents‚Äô wishes.*
19. >I know many women who had to be hospitalised in the lead up to their births for many different reasons, if they hadn‚Äôt acted and gotten medical intervention many of those fetus wouldnt have been born. **Highly reliable sourced data set, I'm actually amazed that someone with so much concern about these laws seriously didn't take the fucking time to actually read the explanatory notes of the amendment.** >i were born months premature via C-section as my umbilical cord was wrapped around his throat and he was lacking vital nutrients without that medical intervention we both would have likely died **Whats wild is LNP are actually advocating for** ***people in that situation*** **essentially but instead it would be phrased without the "*****C-section" and with "termination"*****, Unless you think once you were removed from your c-section and needed healthcare but your parent said "nah we not want" you should be excluded health care and left to die.** (again not forcing the life onto a mother... but just providing medical care to a pre mature neonate; like you were once apon a time) *This Guideline stipulates that in instances where a ‚Äúbaby is born with signs of life and survival is determined to be unlikely,‚Äù the guidelines state that ‚Äúactive treatment‚Äù is not recommended.

20. >a women ‚Äúkeeping herself healthy‚Äù is taking action. Nope, it's just staying alive. If that's wasn't the case, then abortion wouldn't even be a thing. A woman who didn't want her baby could just do nothing and it would die. But that's not how it works. As long as the mother is healthy, the baby will be healthy apart from miscarriages. >an elite athlete choosing to have a baby is going to lead a very different lifestyle then she normally does, as would many different women from many different walks of life. my mother took the action to quite smoking when she was pregnant, many women stop drinking, avoid raw fish and certain foods. I know many women who had to be hospitalised in the lead up to their births for many different reasons, if they hadn‚Äôt acted and gotten medical intervention many of those fetus wouldnt have been born. There are no elite female athletes. You must mean professional female athlete. Yeah, so a woman's actions is going to affect the baby's health, but you're talking about stuff that damages the woman too. Smoking isn't healthy. Still won't kill the baby though most of the time. And talking about difficult pregnancies isn't relevant either, cuz that's very much the exception. >i‚Äôm a twin, my brother and i were born months premature via C-section as my umbilical cord was wrapped around his throat and he was lacking vital nutrients without that medical intervention we both would have likely died Okay, so you're again talking about preventing a miscarriage, not a healthy pregnancy. >shows how very little you know of pregnancy to assume that 100% of women who lead healthy lives give birth to healthy babies I didn't say 100%. Plenty of women have miscarriages. I've read stuff that suggests miscarriage is really common, to the point where early miscarriages often go undetected, since it happens before the woman realises she is pregnant. But for the majority of women, if they do nothing but live healthily, keeping themselves alive, then the baby will be born. It's not a possible baby, it is a definite baby, so you can't escape moral responsibility for abortion that way. >a bundle of cells Haven't heard that excuse for a while. Do you know why no-one is outside dermatologist clinics protesting anyone that goes inside to get a mole removed? Cuz a mole is just a bundle of cells, it's not going to grow and be born. >choosing to have your body ripped apart months early to hopefully save one of your dying fetus That's also not what we're talking about, that's a medical intervention attempting to prevent a miscarriage, not a healthy pregnancy. >i feel sorry for your mother that you seriously think pregnancy is a walk in the park as long as you‚Äôre healthy I never said that either. I know pregnancy is an ordeal and it takes a toll on a woman. My mum had 5 of us, and the last one required her to be hospitalised a lot. The doctors told her not to get pregnant again after that, cuz it would probably kill her.
21. You're acting like pregnancy is skydiving without a parachute, rather than a natural and essential process for keeping the species alive. You're not talking about bodily autonomy, you're talking about body destruction, of the baby. It's a big sticking point for the pro-abortion crowd, "My body, my choice." But the body of the baby is what is under discussion. Pretending the baby doesn't exist is insane. Recognising the baby exists and saying you have the right to kill it is insane. The only ways it can be a thing is when the pregnancy was caused by rape, or if there are medical issues. Even then, it's a sad thing, like euthanising a pet. So no, pregnancy healthcare is not complicated by default, anymore than any healthcare is complicated by default. You're hiding behind the problems that a minority of women experience, and also trying to say that only people with medical degrees can talk about the continuation of the species. So yeah, you're really not being honest here.

25. Can‚Äôt help but make lies up when its only a couple of comment ago. Read it slowly it might click . Ill get you some crayons
26. Where in that sentence does it say Im Fantasizing about you being stoned to death. With all due respect I am but I haven‚Äôt said that and as I said with all due respect I can say what ever I want
27. are you stupid? a misscarriage is also called a spontaneous abortion, a women choosing to end a pregnancy is an induced abortion. you literally did say 100%, and you seem to be straight up pulling stuff from your arse so you can try to justify why a miscarriage from things like alcoholism or substance abuse just doesn‚Äôt count in your book i guess??? i genuinely don‚Äôt even know why i‚Äôm arguing with someone so incredibly dumb that i almost feel like this has to be bait and i‚Äôve just been played like a fiddle, it genuinely scares me that people like you can vote.
28. Insane how you can't see your hypocrisy at play here... Your own mum, if she had gotten pregnant again, would be one of the many to require an abortion for medical reasons.
