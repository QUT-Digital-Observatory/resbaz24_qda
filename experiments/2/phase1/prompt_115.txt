Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Yeah, you've fallen for it, hook, line and sinker. No one in Australia can claim what you've just claimed with a straight face, or a shred of knowledge over media ownership laws in this country. The idea that you think there is a entity of "left-leaning media" shows implicitly that you are a gullible and very loyal consumer of right to hard-right media. The fact is, there is integrity in journalistic standards or not. This is something that used to exist across most journalistic platforms. John Howard changed media ownership laws and media reporting standards. [You can find a succinct summary of how he single handedly caused the issue we have today right here. ](https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/rearvision/the-history-of-media-ownership-in-australia/6831206) I can't possibly engage with you if you think journalism in Australia has had little or nothing to do with why we're in the shit fight we are in.
2. Not a boomer and a cppl generations short. But literally provided the evidence you wanted. Any rational person would think shit, maybe I'm wrong or at least doubt their understanding. But no, the answer is ok boomer like it's a perjorative. And you'll then go on to parrot the same rubbish elsewhere saying 'no evidence' thinking you have the moral high ground when in reality you wear Velcro shoes cause if they were laces you'd never be able to leave the house on time.
3. I’m not even bothered to read your full comment because it’s bulshit after the first two sentences. Go back and read the thread and see if you can figure out who and when youth crime was brought up. Then apologise for not reading the thread or understanding the context of a discussion you’ve just jumped into. If you can do that maybe we can continue but I won’t be holding my breath.
4. Wow. Electioneering during an election! Who woulda thunk it? That's why intelligent people use a healthy dose of skepticism during such times. Re racism. That's your take. You're welcome to it. I prefer to look at the amount of crime when talking about it, not the colour of the perpetrator. Crime is an issue in all the regional areas that had big swings and resulted in a change all Government. To trivialise it as "some regional areas" isn't ackowledging the impact this had on the result.
5. You misunderstand. "I can't possibly engage with you if you think journalism in Australia has had little or nothing to do with why we're in the shit fight we are in." I think the fact that you can't trust anything the media says, and none of them are impartial. That's the problem. I just don't understand why people limit that to Murdoch only. Nine, Seven, Ten, ABC, The Guardian, Murcdoch are all as guilty as each other. But for some reason if the Left don't get their way, it's "because Murdoch". All of the media a culpable. Also, the fact remains. Some people vote right for reasons other than Murdoch. Even if it's the "It's time" factor (that Gough Whitlam used to gain Government), or even issues that are actually Federal issues. You repudiation of a Left Wing media is confirmation that you are not being objective when making such as assessment. I think there are media organisations biased in both directions.
6. Why is your source a screenshot? Show an actual government source and I’ll read it mate. I’ll wait
7. You seem to misunderstand several things. 1- I have no interest in discussing youth crime with you. I do this for a job and spend my days discussing it with other people who actually know what they are talking about, why would I want to debate some person who has no idea what they are talking about…. For fun (?) in my free time? 2- I don’t give a shit about the rest of the thread. You said abortion access isn’t an issue. I disagree. End of discussion.
8. Impartiality is actually a feature of the ABC. You simply cannot lump them in with the rest of who you identified. The Guardian is one of the next most reliable after the ABC. If you read the link I just posted, you'd see why people immediately start talking about Murdoch here in Australia. It's also not a "left" issue... It's an integrity and accuracy in journalism issue. There is no way "they're all the same", Murdoch has poisoned Australia's society and statements like that just water down the damage he's done.
9. https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/townsville/queensland-crime-statistics/ Look at unlawful entry and unlawful use of motor vehicle from 2015. No opinions will be changed, cause despite you claiming LNP voters are the emotional and non logical ones, it's the other way around.
10. You seem to misunderstand a lot of things. 1- you’ve joined an existing conversation, not a new one, so your out of context ranting makes no sense. Like a drunk that bumps into your friend group on the street and begins carrying on about the government. 2- I don’t care what you do for work. 3- we currently have abortion access, so it is categorically not an issue. 4- it is currently not being threatened. 5- youth crime fear mongering was the original discussion point. Youth crime is real. 6- you are a an abortion access fear mongerer. Abortion access being under threat is NOT real. 7- what you *think* is a threat is literally a ‘but what if…’ it’s equal to the threat of a comet the size of Saturn wiping us out tomorrow. That is, it ‘could’ happen, but it’s so unlikely no rational person is panicking about it. Actually it’s less likely than a comet this size of Saturn hitting us.
11. I can't possibly engage with you if you think the ABC is impartial. Impartiality is a feature of the ABC's charter. Not a feature of it's journalism, or the collective group think of it's untouchable staff. I repeat. I agree Murdoch is biased. I don't agree that's the main reason people vote right. Blaming anything but their own opinions is the reason the Left never do an self-reflection, as they can't possibly be wrong.
12. Okay fair point. Wait so answer me this if you’re a fan of facts. Which party in Australia has achieved on average higher economic growth?
13. >Murdoch is biased What an understatement. The fact that you wilfully deny the impact of Australia's hard right media landscape as being a significant trigger for voting outcomes is ridiculous.
14. I honestly can't be fucked mate. you've done nothing but accuse anyone(not just me) that had a different opinion than you of being emotional, controlled by media and generally talking like somehow you have a clue. I did say no opinions would be changed, and despite this I doubt yours has. You just jump to something else. 'but but what about x' When presented that hey, you're wrong,you doubled down. When presented with a graph from police data you triple down. Finally when shown the actual link you go 'fair point' and shift topic to something else. How about you stop being emotional and controlled by media and do some of your own analysis. I doubt youre capable as you've already shown. Your entire attitude is exactly why Labor lost as you aren't alone. Just toe the party line. I really hope you grow up one day.
15. You do have an issue with comprehension. Something can be a significant trigger, and still not be the main reason for a voting outcome. A lot of people will vote right because of Murdoch. At any given election, there might also be other main reason(s) for an outcome. Like the main regional cities voting against an incumbent because crime is increasing in their area (Note: I said increasing in regional areas, not across the whole state). You only need a small number to switch the Government. So let's say for people voting Right in an election outcome (figures for example only) 20% voted because of Murdoch 25% Because of regional crime 30% Because of cost of living, just not happy with their lives, and want a change. Even if they aren't correct and some of these are Federal issues. 10% Because they are disengaged completely and that's the way my Dad voted The rest because they don't like the Greens or preferred Anna to Miles. That means Murdoch is significant, but not the main reason. And above doesn't list a bunch of other reasons people might want to change. The Murdoch factor is significant, but not the reason. Certainly not the only reason. I can't believe you don't think there is any other reason why people might have changed their vote besides "Because Murdoch".
16. You thinking there is no left leaning media in Australia is also ridiculous. "Because Murdoch", is a staggering lack of critical thinking and self awareness.
17. Labor swung to the left because Miles said fuck you to the coal lobby and corporate interests
18. I'm sure these ideas were being talked about amongst Labor left but the reason everyone is calling them green's policies is that the greens actually put them on their platform and marketed them. Having discussions about them internally doesn't count. Re housing - it's extremely frustrating that you either don't read your own article or you're being purposefully obtuse. Grace's position (as stated in the article) is that we don't solve the housing crisis by allowing developers to build high rises with 20% guaranteed to be affordable. All that does is gift developers a massive profit, skirts planning regulation and we STILL only produce a small number of affordable units. We need social and affordable housing. What is being proposed is actually just using the housing crisis to funnel money to developers.
19. >I think the main reason for the Green's abysmal performance Greens had a literal swing to them. Small, but positive. Meanwhile Labor got hammered, with a ~-6.8% swing. The seat count is just a result of how our TPP system works. Next time the same votes might get them 3-4 seats.
20. As someone who generally votes for the Greens I’m very happy that Labor decided to adopt their policies. This is a good thing. Greens pushing these policies for years is what lays the groundwork to shift public perception enough that Labor are no longer too scared to adopt them. This is a perfect example of what people mean when they say we need the Greens to pull Labor to the left.
21. Key point here. Unless demographics change significantly a party is not going to win regional Queensland by moving further left.
22. By what metric are you calling the greens performance abysmal? They didn’t lose any primary vote at all in an election that swung way to the right. Labor had a 6-7% swing against them and greens 0%. I think it’s tricky when people hold up the Labor left as a poster child for progressivism. Sort your party out and do the policies — you don’t get brownie points for internally murmuring about being good for 10 years then do it for 10 months and lose the election to LNP anyway. Your party has ages to do these policies and didn’t, it doesn’t really matter that people inside your party agreed with the greens, they didn’t advocate for it and spent the whole time shitting on greens publicly saying it was unrealistic
23. The Greens buggered themselves with the preferences. Their all out war on Labor isn't doing them any favours either.
24. Im sick of people giving credit to the greens for labor policy as if just having the dot point on their website means they got it past the line let alone moved it in that direction. Obviously its because the greens like to take credit for things they didnt do. But spose the way to gain voters is to blatantly lie to them repeatedly.
25. 80% of unaffordable housing also causes gentrification and pushes poorer people that already live there out of the suburb down the line.
26. It does actually fix the housing crisis, go look at mt Isa housing prices, it’s just supply and demand. You do realise around 35% of property developers and building company’s went bankrupt in 2023 right? The housing crisis exists in 7 cities, we need to build more dense housing. Building 14,000 homes would lower the cost for everyone by reducing demand and increasing supply Federal labor already set up a 14 billion dollar fund to build social and affordable housing. We can do multiple things at once ya know?? Also the entire post was stating where the idea came from. Tf you mean it doesn’t count if it came from internally??
27. >ABC: The inner Brisbane seats of Cooper and McConnel are among a string of target electorates for the Greens this state election as they vie to boost their numbers in Queensland's parliament. >The minor party has two sitting members, South Brisbane MP Amy MacMahon and Maiwar MP Michael Berkman, but it has also set its sights on Greenslopes, Clayfield, Moggill, Miller, Stafford and Bulimba. The issue is the Greens didn't do well in the seats they targeted, and no QLD Upper House makes their state PV fruitless. Incumbent seats: * Maiwar = -7.3% * South Brisbane = -2.8% Priority target seats: * Cooper = -4.8% * McConnel = -3.2%
28. ERM ACTUALLY there was -0.1% swing away. But the main point was that everyone exspected them to pick up cooper and mcconnel. They failed and scored thrid place, along with lossing south brisbane preeee bad on a FPV compared to 2020.
29. Swings aren't the only yardstick with which to measure a political party's performance. Did they not lose 50% of their mp representatives? Almost 100%?
30. As someone who’s conservative, I’m very happy to see Labor adopt the Greens policies. The truth is, the left side of Labor doesn’t win very often, and Labor moving further to the left is exactly what the coalition wants
31. Well the greens are free to compete in regional Queensland.
32. How so? The greens preferenced Labor on their HTV cards
33. You say that as if it's the Greens who are antagonistic towards Labor while Labor's seething hatred of the Greens couldn't be more obvious. Federally the Greens have supported almost every single policy that Labor has put forward, they've argued against the HAFF on the basis that it will be almost entirely worthless and stymie real progress by allowing Labor to claim that they've already legislated the issue.
34. You’d have a point if they were just “dot points”, but they’re fully costed and researched policies.
35. Private developers will never solve the housing crisis, because they will never sell a unit for less than the maximum profit that’s possible. They would rather hold off on building, keep applying for higher buildings, then drip feed supply at the end. Covid demonstrated that simple ‘supply and demand’ aint it. Its a lie peddled by property developers and their supporters (e.g. murdoch and the 2 major parties). During covid, demand was zero or near zero at times, yet house prices consistently went up. Even when rents weren’t really moving and vacancy rates were at record levels (e.g. airbnbs no longer profitable so likely becoming rentals or being sold). Only one economist in Australia predicted this - Cameron Murray. You should read his books.
36. You think that Labor left came up with cheaper/free public transport? That seems extremely unlikely, it's a pretty basic idea. Sure, I agree you build enough homes then prices will drop. I'd argue though that there's better methods that what is being proposed. Mandate some social housing and increase the amount of affordable housing. That gets us there quicker and everyone still makes money.
37. >and no QLD Upper House makes their state PV fruitless. That applies to all parties who don't form gov, including Labor
38. I assume your differences are because the vote still isn't complete. ABC is showing 0% swing for greens at the moment (for the whole state). The greens were expecting much better results so this is coming as a bit of a shock. Everyone seems to be jumping to point their fingers at something but it's extremely hard to know what caused it and in reality it's probably a constellation of issues. Id say a general positive was the number of people wanting to get involved in the greens movement. Unfortunately it wasn't reflected in the votes so we'll need to figure out why that is.
39. So if the Greens had an "abysmal performance", how did Labor do?
40. No offence, but have you considered politics thats not some jerk off between red and blue- and instead representative of voters and movements? Is it that crazy to suggest a good “Labor” party is one that stays strong to Labourism and the working class?
41. And Labor preferenced the Legalise Cannabis party because the greens weren't palatable. I'm not suggesting the Greens should try and fit in with the LNP/ALP duopoloy, but they need to change gears.
42. Their argument against HAFF looks really silly now though doesn't it. You can't stonewall forever. Remember the carbon tax? Honestly, the Greens don't know when they're born sometimes. You neogitate, you don't just say no for no.
43. Fully costed like the labor implementation labor braches have veen gunning for, at half the cost the greens proposed? Again, two parties can have the same general policy doesnt mean they did jack diddly squat to get it cross the line nor had any intention too. The greens would have blocked 50c fairs if they could have, thats all they've been doing.
44. True, and Labor also received a much higher swing against them. But the full picture puts it into context. Labor were in government for a decade, and were defending a PV of 39% & 51 seats.
45. The greens are well on their way to irrelevance in Queensland politics. Labor did roughly as poorly as you'd expect a government of 10 years to do.
46. It means they didn't get the votes where they needed to. But hey going from 1 to 1.4% of the primary vote in some other seat is real progress hey?
47. Labor abandoned the working class years ago and has become a party of the elites. That’s why they struggle in suburban and rural seats, which have a higher proportion of working class voters
48. Yeah I remember the carbon tax, the one that was passed as soon as Gillard got in and actually negotiated? Do you? The fact that the carbon tax is used against the Greens shows that those using it aren't acting in good faith. The timeline of events was that Rudd negotiated with the LNP to design a carbon tax that they would support, effectively neutering it to gain their support. The Liberals then knifed their leader and replaced him with Abbott, who categorically refused to support any carbon tax, so Rudd took that neutered carbon tax that was negotiated with the LNP and tried to force it past the Greens without any negotiation. Explain to me if you can why it's reasonable to argue that the Greens aren't allowed to negotiate legislation but must instead simply rubber stamp whatever Labor puts forward else they be branded wreckers, while similar standards are applied to literally no other party? I would also note that the HAFF was passed, you seem to be under the impression that it wasn't? But the Greens passed it after negotiating for an extra 3 billion in immediate dispersement.
49. Yes, I’m aware that Labor changed each policy to be essentially half of what the Greens policies were. Did you forget what you were talking about? And lol, Greens would have (and did) push for free public transport and would have accepted 50c fares. If Labor want to waste money that’s fine
50. If you're trying to inform us that Greens are a minor party and Labor a major one.. there's no real need.
51. Well thankfully Labor keeps on copying Greens policies, so I'm happy
52. And Liberal’s for the working class? I’m not a Labourist but they’re the better evil.
53. The same Carbon Tax that the Coalition ripped up. If it was passed sooner in 2008/2009 then they wouldn't have been able to. Remember that, the Greens teamed up with the Coalition to destroy an environmental initiative. I think the Senate works as a negotiating chamber, but the Greens are far too self righteous now. Have you seen the last two elections? The Greens went backwards, forgot the grassroots, and just acted like they had support when they didn't. That's a leaf straight out of the Morrison playbook. I'd also point out that the Greens have pretty much been a rubber stamp. Remember the NAAC, that failed toothless agency that does nothing, the Greens gave Labor free road to just steamroll that clowncar bill through parliament. How is that serious policy negotiation? I'd love you to explain where I ever said the greens aren't allowed to negotiate. Frankly, i'd love a hung parliament right now, Labor are a joke, the Libs are still a joke, and we need to hold these governments to greater account. Maybe if the Greens got their act together they would've won seats like Richmond, Wills, Cooper and Macnamara. But I digress.
54. Let me guess, you voted for the school captain candidate who said they’d replace the water bubblers with soft drink?
55. Labor shills trying to convince people that losing majority government is somehow less damaging than losing a few thousand Greens votes in Brisbane 😂
56. Well yeah they did: 2012 was the benchmark. * LNP had 78/89 seats - 87.7% of parliament * ALP had 7/89 seats - 7.9% of parliament Atm it's: * LNP has 48/93 seats - 51.6% of parliament currently * ALP has 31/93 seats - 33.3% of parliament currently Labor is significantly stronger in opposition this time around even if they don't get the last few seats in doubt.
57. This is a super fair Brisbane view, outside of Brisbane though that just takes us to the position we have now - a liberal government. The more the left fights amongst itself the less effective it is.
58. Nah you haven't. At the end of the day the regress of losing 50% of your representative completely cancels out any claims of progress due to non consequential swings. To try and spin it any other way is extreme cope. The whole point is to try and win seats. No get small unimportant swings in safe seats owned by other parties. On the subject of swings, if the same happens in the same areas at the federal election soon, Greens may very well lose a couple of seats there. They better start sandbagging MCM's electorate.
59. How do you explain the middle class seats voting for the Liberals then?
60. Your arguments seem disjointed, first you claimed that their arguments against the HAFF were silly, and then when I pointed out that the HAFF had been passed you argue they're a rubber stamp. To take your points in order though, you believe that if a less effective carbon tax had been passed a year or two earlier the coalition wouldn't have been able to repeal it? Based on what are you coming to that conclusion. Next you say the Greens teamed up with the coalition to destroy an environmental initiative, this simply didn't happen. There's not much more to say than that. Next, the Greens vote share has remained relatively stable or grown, up to 12% in recent elections. Your next point is somehow more absurd, within the same thread you're claiming that the Greens should have passed subpar legislation in 2008-9, that their arguments against the HAFF look silly and thus they should have presumably voted for it sooner? And that they're a rubber stamp allowing bad legislation through. To hold all of those positions simultaneously borders on the schizophrenic. Finally the NACC. Both major parties supported the weakened NACC, the Greens did not have the power to singlehandedly pass a better bill, although they did improve it along with the cross bench.
61. It would be cheaper to get rid of fares since you need to pay for the system, maintenance and enforcement. I don’t remember voting for school captain
62. Your first mistake is thinking middle-class and working-class are synonymous. Even then, voter base is not reflective of that party actually supporting working-class people. Specific economic and social policy is. Most people do not understand policy, they consume Murdoch slop and vote based on it. We all fall prey to living in our own echo chamber. The difference of what you do with that, how you criticise it… that is dependent on empathy and education.
63. Okay your just making nothing point and just rehashing what you said already. Your delusional if you think the Greens are doing well. They lost seats in the ACT, and QLD and are very much gonna lose seats like Ryan at the next federal election.
64. If people dont pay a tolken amount it becomes a lot more difficult to get numbers. To get the policy through quickly its best to do it as a 50c fair. Enforcement still have their jobs and its a whole lot easier now so whatever. Greens would have blocked it because its not free despite it being a 500% decrease in cost and a trial. The greens are just covert LNP shills maskerading as progressives, that is why they continue to vote with the lnp.
65. Would cost less than $10k to implement people counting software on the existing camera system. Weird that you’re saying they would have blocked it when they’ve openly supported the policy, but whatever makes you feel better I guess
