Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. The youth being worse off their parents is new. This is the result of capitalist interests capturing the state. The upper class and even upper middle is probably 10-15% of our whole population max. The gap between upper and upper middle is also quite large. Just under half our population is 45 and over, and many of those people still feel the squeeze, despite being better positioned. Elder care in Australia is infamously terrible. The pension has not kept up with inflation, the retirement age has risen over time. Healthcare is less affordable. Even if you own your home, a pension is no longer a viable way to retire without additional savings. A child today born into a rich family is not a boomer by definition. Venture capitalists and techn billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg are millenials. Rich or poor, wealth and social class at all levels are inherited. So no, generation and class are entirely distinct. Wealth has consolidated itself over time, nothing more. That boomers skew conservative at all is merely a symptom of a much wider problem. There's nothing inherantly boomerish about ragging on the youth. As I've said, generational tensions have existed since forever.
2. You might want to have a little look at how much public transport can cost a poor person mate. In Melbourne a day trip costs me over $10. That's per day, every day.
3. Can't do much worse than that? That's opinion though, maybe they can. Don't forget electricity bill subsidies too. And what was also going ahead school lunches, competitive petrol initiatives, lots of the table that won't happen now. I'd be keen to see how removing mining royalties for queenslanders, helps queenslanders. This is removing a tax on billionaires for our natural resources we can only mine once, how does it make sense?
4. We already know what they are going to do genius, give the money back to the mining corps.
5. Tbh, yeah. He shouldn't get to enjoy the prime part of his life (age 30 to 45) as a free man after what he did.
6. Yep I agree. I just pray enough of your generation read about the many failed attempts at socialism and realise .. when you centralise power and decision making you pave the path to authoritarian regimes and no amount of praying or begging will stop humans from taking advantage of those classed as lesser then themselves.
7. Ha. You are betting your life on it! No one will help a POS that has crawled over others to be ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù.
8. It's no use trying to bring logic and facts into the argument. It's crazy how critical people are but they don't even know what they are arguing on. They don't know the policy and didn't even try to look them up. When you provide the facts it doesn't fit their narrative so they just try to dodge and weave.
9. I'm not missing the point. You're assuming the status quo on abortion is defacto a 'reasonable position', which it isn't. You also don't consider the cultural elements of the election bringing abortion back into the debate, pr the green light that particular activist groups will take to start pressuring their conservative MPs to take action. Yeah, people worried that abortion bills are up day 1 might be catastrophising, but it doesn't change the plain fact that lots of money was spent by various groups to make abortion a topic for the election and that was not money spent 'for nothing' and their general concerns are valid.
10. That‚Äôs quite literally the majority or experiences, kids broke into my grandfathers and he‚Äôs paranoid now and made his house Fort Knox with 4 locks on every door, keeps a sword next to his chair as well now haha. Most people aren‚Äôt just getting something nicked and it‚Äôs all well and good in the long run, join any local Facebook group and I guarantee you there‚Äôs at least a few people constantly posting about break ins and posting security camera shots. I know the people down the street from me have been broken into 14 times (not an understatement). It‚Äôs unfortunately the reality of youth crime and I don‚Äôt even like the libs
11. We do. We elected a Prime Minister, didn't we? We elected a premier yesterday, didn't we?
12. Maybe other things outweigh that concern ? Most people cast their vote based on a wide range of issues not just one thing . Obviously a lot of Queenslanders don‚Äôt see that issue in the same light you do . That does not make them dumb or ignorant, just different
13. Strange they didn't implement it until elections were coming up ü§î
14. Ah yes, let's claim undone things as pure certainties to suite our agenda, that's healthy.
15. Do you think we should attempt rehabilitation? And if so do you think there‚Äôs any chance of a successful rehab if this person misses all the years of early adulthood and comes out late middle aged?
16. Who brought abortion into the debate? It was the ALP trying to find an issue to wedge the LNP on.
17. There are many factors that come into the picture when trying to use a forum such as Facebook for evidence collecting, however I'd like to park this conversation here, as at a certain point I don't think we will agree on some details when it comes to evaluating statistics and crime experiences. Rest assured, I don't wish for these events to happen to people, I want to find a solution that will be a net benefit to society that includes rehabilitation of former perpetrators back into society as positive-effect contributors. In the end, I think we want the same results, we just have a different methodology
18. Willingly voting for a party that bolsters the mega rich and harms the poor is pretty fucked if you ask me.
19. They kept it cheap up until then right? So you had the cheapest and then it got cheaper again before elections? The Libs would have already made it partly pqrivate years ago in the same position. Profit needs making then. Nothing gets cheaper under Libs unless you earn mid 6 figs.
20. Tbh, he's had multiple chances at rehabilitation, considering he's had 75 convictions already with each one of these involving more counciling and more rehabilitation. If those 75 attempts at rehabilitation have failed, then it's too late, and he didn't want to rehabilitate, so now he has to simply pay for his crimes. He destroyed the lives of a husband, 2 kids, and a grandmother who Emma Lovell was the primary carer of. We allow victims to give a victim impact statement during sentencing because the level of punishment needs to be appropriate for the impact on the victim.
21. You reckon the ALP sent out the flyers out claiming Labor are pro abortion up to birth? Bold strategy
22. And thinking the ALP with their mega rich donors are any different is of a similar standing. There is a very obvious reason why we yo-yo between the two same old tired and broken options in this country ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. because they are not much different to each other so it takes very little to tip the scales in favour of one or the other . This has been going on for the entire 42 years of my existence and with a bit of reading it‚Äôs revealed that it‚Äôs been going on for long before that too . We are not America and this ‚Äúanyone who doesn‚Äôt support my team is lesser than me‚Äù attitude that is creeping into Australia is pretty concerning. Not a lot changes in the day to day lives of the majority of Australians regardless of who is in power , portions of society benefit and suffer depending on whose in power but as a whole , things just continue on the same regardless.
23. Queensland public transport the past decade had been one of the most expensive in the world and was the most expensive in the country. It took the potential of losing an election for Labor to make it cheap. But hey, that doesn't fit your narrative.
24. You know abortion started becoming an election issue before that, right? And was it the LNP who sent those flyers around?
25. Except the ALP has been deemed the best economic manager a few times. In the world, mind you. The difference between ALP and LNP donors is that everyday residents actually benefit from ALP policy. LNP does absolutely fuck all, they essentially gut our public system in favor of privatization. You're 42, you know for a fact Newman completely fucked over QLD. Labor, federal, and state has done an incredible amount to improve our standard of living, yet it's thrown back in their faces. Please do not pretend these parties are remotely comparable to one another. It is a lazy and shitty cop out.
26. Did you really just say it "doesn't fit my narrative"? Yea mate, I sit at home crafting these tricky narratives on a whiteboard after work. Didn't just get a fact wrong.
27. When did I make my point around who bought the issue up? It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that LNP is weak on the abortion issue electorally because of the parties they work in coalition with. No matter who bought it up, interested parties put money on communicating in favour of making abortion illegal on the back of a labor loss. Keep ducking and weaving and changing the claim as much as you want, but those are facts from the conservative side of QLD politics
28. Well you just made it all up, so not sure what else you trying to do apart from deceive. >They kept it cheap up until then right? No they didn't, QLD public transport was one of most expensive in the world and was the most expensive in QLD. https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/sep/21/australia-public-transport-costs-queensland-50c-fares >So you had the cheapest and then it got cheaper before the elections? No it wasn't the cheapest, it was the most expensive in the country and one of the most expensive in the world. Then after 10 years when Labor knew they were going to lose the election they tried to buy votes by making 50c fares. Another source just in case - https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-13/should-public-transport-be-free-in-australia-train-bus-tram/103621040 So where are your facts that weren't wrong?
29. You fell for the scare campaign. The LNP isn't going to change abortion and the ALP only made an issue out of this because it was the only issue that was getting traction in the electorate. The LNP were blindsided and weren't prepared. which is why their response was so ham fisted. If we get to the end of this term and nothing has changed, are you willing to accept that you were deceived into believing a scare campaign? I also suggest you actually look into what changes KAP was proposing. They aren't all that extreme. The 2 key takeaways from the KAP proposal are: - Removal of social reasons for an abortion after 22 weeks, so you would simply need to decide before the 22 mark if your social circumstances aren't suitable to becoming a mother - Removal of the requirement that a conscientious objecting doctor refer you to another doctor, you'd still be free to find another doctor on your own, though.
30. See there go, bit of actual discussion instead of making it personal. Very impressed.
31. Ah yes ‚ÄòI fell for LNP being the party most susceptible to regressive abortion laws‚Äô Your copy paste response is something I already aware of and point 2 is literally how our discussion started. Did you reset your NPC responses in this thread overnight?
32. Excuse me if I done click on the show more messages to see what comments have previously been posted. Answer my 2 questions though. - Will you accept you fell for a scare campaign if your fear mongering turns out to be just that? - Do you think those changes are extreme?
33. You‚Äôll understand my position if you reread the responses, looking to understand and not just post your slogans. The fact you want to gaslight people into the idea that the LNP government is less susceptible to regression in abortion rights is so patently absurd that it‚Äôs embarrassing to both of us to dissect. Count how many times in the last month they didn‚Äôt full throatedly benounce the lies about abortion spread y their allies in the Katter party
34. When LNP was in power 12 years ago, they legislated to freeze the coal royalty for 10 years. And Labor changed that as soon as that legislation expired 2 years ago. And now LNP is in power again. RIP QLD
35. Absolute travesty. When you know that other, more advanced countries have the wisdom and moral maturity to share the wealth of their country's natural resources with all of that country's people it hurts even more. Sure, Clive Palmer and Gina Reinhart and the freakin' Adani conglomerate have the backing and the brazenness to establish these mining ventures - but what they are taking from Australian soil is in no way theirs and theirs alone. But it's far, *far* worse than merely watching our Country's natural resources being eaten up and exploited by the privileged few. With the Greens shooting themselves in the foot and taking their eyes off their one obvious selling point, the LNP in QLD have been given a licence to squander any progress the state had been making in the increasingly-beleagured transition to renewables and drill baby drill, as Gina is fond of saying. No wonder our Pacific neighbours have had a fucking gutful and are eyeing China as a legitimate alternative to Australia's rampant Eco-Vandalism.
36. Didn‚Äôt Crisafulli commit to keeping 50c fares? Let‚Äôs hold him to account for that.
37. why does she look like a temu-version of Melissa McCarthy.
38. "The LNP will not make any changes to revenue-raising *coal royalties*"
39. Real hard working Queenslanders will have jobs again. We don't give a flying f%$#ck about the train fares in Brisbane's commie-land.
40. Maybe if they spent that coal money on the coal communities instead of vote buying SEQ with 50 cents fares it might have been different...
41. Guys you are making the Australia sub look positive!! Take the L, accept that your voices are the minority for now, and play on, enjoy some sun, the beach, stop complaining!!!!! üçªüçªüçªüçª
42. Ummmmm... That's Magda Szubanski in that photo üòÜüòÜüòÜ. She's no mining mandate! But hey, don't let the truth get in the way of leftist rhetoric!
43. If you had a brain or paid attention to your own state you‚Äôd realise the coal price has collapsed and coal royalty rates are all ready back to what they were before Labor introduced the higher royalties for higher prices scheme‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
44. Oh no, the 50c fares that were buying votes in SEQ but useless to 90% of the state might be in danger boo hoo. Meanwhile the Bruce Highway north of Gympie is so poor a fucking fertiliser bomb happened a couple of months ago. But what do dead people matter when SEQ can feel good about themselves?
45. ...and it is the rural electorates that put us here that'll get the health cuts One term government here we go again :)
46. Completely non-agenda related question just curious if anyone knows can a government make legislation that can't be changed once they are ousted? Like LNP were in for one term why did Labor have to wait for the 10 years to expire to change that?
47. Gina owns Iron Ore mines in WA - how does the QLD election result benefit her bank account?
48. How have the greens shot themselves in the foot? Their campaign has been consistent for ages
49. Yes let‚Äôs go to China that has more than 1B tonnes of new coal projects in the pipeline as of now to add to their existing 3B tonnes of capacity. Compared to Australia that export less than 0.5B tonnes and haven‚Äôt increased capacity for 10 years‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
50. He's committed to keeping them (either for the 6 month trial or the term, I don't remember) AND scrapping their funding source. I believe him about the cut.
51. The LNP lie almost as much as his orangeness and they don't give a shit about being hypocrites.
52. > Let‚Äôs hold him to account for that. There's just one problem. How? This is what the right wing have learnt in the last decade. Aside from screwing up so bad in office that they don't get re-elected, there are literally no consequences to doing a bad job, giving mates backhanders, and generally being an evil cunt stuffing their own pockets with as much money as they can before ducking out with a hearty, "Fuck the rest of you!"
53. ‚Äú‚Ä¶in the first term‚Äù so I guess we will be talking about this again next election if they are true to their word. Interesting he only says coal, not ‚Äúmining royalties‚Äù I wonder if other royalties is where he‚Äôs planning to save his mining mates. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they force the relevant department to change the definition of coal.
54. It‚Äôs funny that you think they will stick to that. When have pollies ever done that? I can only think of one really and they voted him out last night.
55. Unless you're a healthcare professional, teachers, professors, town planners, and other jobs on the list of cut by the LNP government.
56. Unfortunately there will be no more coal money coming into gov to spend on anything North or South anymore. Basically only the mining companies, shareholders and their employees will benefit. The only good things is the jobs, but they won‚Äôt increase as a result of reduced royalties - same amount of mining, more profit for the business, less money to spend on Queenslanders. Both Crisafulli and Miles have talked about improving public transport up North, amid a myriad of other promises - hold them to it and they may very well need to keep the royalties.
57. Imagine getting mad that the Govt made commuting more affordable in a cost of living crisis.
58. And they‚Äôll be even less if they get reduced or scraped.
59. Oh no, how dare the government spend money in the area where 70% of the population lives?!?
60. We spend up to 70% more per capita in NQ/CQ than SEQ, and I would be the first to support QLD increasing spending in those areas if it‚Äôs not enough to build or maintain the infrastructure our regions need ($6+ billion is already allocated/budgeted for the Bruce Highway). The 50-cent fares were one of the quickest and easiest ways for the government to help millions of people, but it's certainly not all that needs to be done (and definitely not all that was being done). For reference: [https://imgur.com/a/iOFUfNI](https://imgur.com/a/iOFUfNI)
61. Well, maybe if labor actually gave a shit about us, we wouldn't have voted for the LNP üòí
62. And funding cuts - because no money - so more potholes after every flood from climate change.
63. No, you can‚Äôt - any law can be changed by the majority unless it‚Äôs to do with specific things covered off in the constitution which would require a referendum.
64. In very simplified terms, yet but if you are able to entrench the change through a particular type of constitutional amendment.
65. They really must see us all as just puppets on a strong, rightfully so
66. She and Clive will be opening up new coal projects https://www.inqld.com.au/business/2022/04/19/zombie-coal-clive-and-gina-fight-for-coal-projects-worth-18-billion
67. She is opening up new privatized prisons and is running incentive campaigns with judges to fill them up fast. Gina wants 150% capacity at her prisons.
68. Don‚Äôt bother these people are zealots. Just sit back and laugh at all the things they‚Äôre making up in their own head and them all freaking out over nothing really changing a great deal
69. Too much focus on Palestine, I think. At least the parts that make mainstream media.
70. Yea but China buys majority of our coal anyway doesn't it?
71. I reckon they will u turn on this when they realise they can‚Äôt run the state without them.
72. True, but let‚Äôs not make this a self fulfilling prophecy. If we all keep saying LNP won‚Äôt keep 50c fares, will get rid of royalties etc then we‚Äôre almost doing their work for them. I‚Äôd rather shift the dialogue to, ‚Äúyou said you would/wouldn‚Äôt and that‚Äôs what we expect‚Äù I didn‚Äôt vote for my local LNP candidate, but I will still engage with them politely now elected. They said it was fear mongering, so give them a chance to do the right thing, expect them to do the right thing and call it out if they don‚Äôt.
73. It‚Äôs not easy however giving up isn‚Äôt the way either. - Remain politically engaged. - use public interest disclosures if something is genuinely corrupt - support non Murdoch media - don‚Äôt be shy about your views amongst conservative friends - participate on in your union if relevant - utilise the 50c public transport - go to the media if you lose access to a public service - be a helpful citizen where you can. volunteer with or donate to homelessness organisations that are about to be scraped. If you know of a young person at risk getting involved in criminal activities and you can help them or their parent, do. Ask Gina and Co to help as well. - demand better from business and corporations. If you know of profitable businesses not appropriately paying workers or evading tax, dob them in.
74. Yea bro, LNP will also cause a nuclear war if they win every state also.
75. What is your position based on here, do you understand how the royalties regime works in QLD? Royalties are based on the market price of coal - if the price is up they pay more dollars & a higher %, if the price is down they pay a lower %. Currently the price of coal is $139/t which means they pay up to 12.5%. The 40% tier was achieved only when the price went to a once in a lifetime price. The amount of income for QLD would be exactly the same whether the changes labor made were in or not‚Ä¶the one time sugar hit is gone, that‚Äôs what paid for the one of things like $1,000 rebates etc. More on the royalties regime on the Government website if you‚Äôd like to know more. https://qro.qld.gov.au/royalty/calculate-mineral/rates/
76. To be fair, people in regional QLD with fuck all public transport do not give a shit about 50c fares.
77. So they‚Äôre going to reduce them from the 2013 mineral resources regulation. Wow‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
78. Oh no, how dare people care about where they actually fucking live. You are so out of touch it's incredible. You lose the election and still think you haven't done anything wrong. You lost *Mackay and Rockhampton*, that's how badly you fucked up haha Seriously, is there no introspection in the Labor party these days?
79. You think that the LNP or KAP gives a fuck about you?
80. I think you‚Äôre correct about business confidence, but if there‚Äôs no legal reason that prevents an incoming government from changing the royalties agreement then it should be changed. My gut feeling is that Labor were happy to forgo the royalties for whatever reason but decided to increase them with the end of the contract because they knew that the voters were getting agitated towards them. Maybe I‚Äôm being cynical, but I don‚Äôt think so.
81. It IS comparable to the take-over of Gondwana Lands though.
82. No they don‚Äôt they buy the majority of our iron ore(WA),they banned our coal exports and Japan and Korea picked up the slack. You probably don‚Äôt realise this but most of Queensland‚Äôs coal is for steel making. It‚Äôs NSW that produces largely thermal coal for power.
83. That's not how the LNP works, they legitimately broke the state last time, I expect it will be worse this go around.
84. If it comes down to 50c fares vs mining royalties, then they will slash services elsewhere. They get to have their cake and eat it too, then (keeping 50c fares while undoing the royalties).
85. But that's the problem. Historically they don't..they've had plenty of chances, maybe not in this state but elsewhere. And they fuck it up. Every.god.damn.time... pun intended
86. Well the federal lot does want nuclear power. I doubt a war, but a nuclear disaster wouldn‚Äôt surprise me at all. The mob that can‚Äôt even build a car park without stuffing it up want to play with uranium, yeah, nah.
87. Or it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not an idiot and know that most politicians/parties say one thing and then end up not doing it.
88. So you support pork barrelling? Since when did Bruz relocated to Queensland?
89. Ahh ok I knew they bought something from us couldn't remember what. I knew it was used in steel making too as a company I used to work for had dealings with blue scope... but thought that was only a small chunk of the coal market. I thought most of our coal mines here was exported to china
