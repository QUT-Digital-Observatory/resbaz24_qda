Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. Also votes from other polling booths from people out of area that need to get sent down, e.g people from Brisbane voting in a Townsville booth.
2. The problem is that in rural areas it's up dramatically. That's why the argument is pervasive among LNP circles in rural strongholds. Split it up by region and you see massive spikes since COVID for Far North and North West. Rural areas haven't recovered as well, so poverty and crime go hand in hand.
3. Yep and if the fool is elected,watch it grow like a weed in spring üå±
4. Just watch how quickly the commercial right wing media drop this ‚Äúyouf crimeee‚Äù narrative once the LNP move in.
5. What about compared to 10 years when Labor first came in?
6. Oh and is that the ACT and SA, our two most progressive electorates with the lowest rates! Might be something to this listening to those who validly study such things.
7. But this doesn‚Äôt fit the LNP and media narrative *screeches in Murdoch news*
8. Meanwhile ALP election material literally told us to 'cut' Crisafulli
9. My vision is a little colour-deficient, so that graph was hard to read, the colour choices were terrible. I shifted the colours and moved the labels to make it easier to read https://i.imgur.com/bJ5X6G9.jpg
10. Come Live in Townsville and tell me if youth crime is reducing
11. Bro fuck off with this city slicker stat. Come to Cairns and Townsville and these little cunts are getting away with everything.
12. If you notice in the last few weeks,, they changed the narrative from youth crime to crime
13. When I was growing up, I remember hearing that if I broke the law it was my parents who were going to be held responsible. Why aren't we doing that? Now I will say that some parents, despite doing their very best, still end up with shithead kids. But what we need to do is provide services that those parents can reach out to in order to intervene before things turn bad. If the parents reach out, and do everything they can to get the child help, then if the child still screws up we put them in age appropriate supervision. If the parents are neglectful, don't reach out and their children turn into criminals then the parents should be held partially responsible for those crimes. The LNP idea of "Adult Crime, Adult Time" has never worked anywhere. We need to find out what's gone wrong to allow these kids to get to where they have. Punishment at the end of where they end up isn't going to stop the crime from happening. We need early intervention and an onus on the parents to reach out for it. We also need to kill the racism behind this and acknowledge that if it seems to be coming from one particular racial community, maybe that community isn't getting the resources they need. Engage with them and ask them what could help!
14. Bro Crime per person is not a valid statisic. Even miles called david out during the debate. its a red herring
15. Its almost flat-lined over the last 6 years . Too little , too late .
16. Now show the data specific to regional areas. For example Townsville. [https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/townsville/queensland-crime-statistics/](https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/townsville/queensland-crime-statistics/) [https://redsuburbs.com.au/suburbs/townsville-city/](https://redsuburbs.com.au/suburbs/townsville-city/) It's especially more obvious when the crimes that are going up are crimes against property and person - Much more "in your face".
17. maybe in inner Brisbane sure but in rural areas mate youth crime is through the roof
18. How does this graph differentiate between stealing deodorant as opposed to having someone break into your house and steal your car?
19. Love a bit of Astroturfing. Just remember, it's an election not a revolution. So much angst in here. This sub is so not representative of the great state of Queensland at all.
20. I don‚Äôt really understand the argument here. Are we saying enough is being done about youth crime?
21. The reported incidences may have decreased however the level of violence, weapons used & damage to life & property has skyrocketed. The Police catch them, the idiot Magistrates following weak Labor laws just let them straight out to do it again, and they DO. Adult crime, adult time. No more pussy footing with these repeat offender thugs.
22. Felt good putting labor 5th lower than the Greens and One Nation ahhh
23. Youth crime is unironically falling because of computers and phones.
24. ALP probably should have waited until after the election to talk about negative gearing amendments‚Ä¶ no boomer offsetting their income with the 3 properties they bought for $100k each are going to allow that to be taken away.
25. Found this article and shared it with my sister who believes the 'oh no, let's lock up everyone because I fear for my house' hype pushed by the LNPs.
26. Then the issue is poverty causing youth crime, no? Policies that impact housing and food insecurity are going to impact youth crime. The issue is his solutions to youth crime is just detention and stronger penalties. Those don't touch the underlying issues which drive crime in young people.
27. This. Any chart that splits out Cairns and Townsville shows youth crime going up in those areas. And no surprises, that‚Äôs where the message of youth crime is resonating with voters, and where the seats look to be flipping.
28. Also, what is the crime being committed get parotted out and I do agree it's important information. I just don't see how anyone thinks prisons in their current form has ever helped anyone. And I get it's not about helping but punishing, I just wish it wasn't.
29. Where are you finding stats for regional Queensland? I can only find that the areas experiencing highest youth crime is Brisbane City not regional qld and the numbers of crimes have dropped. Can't find anything that show stats for regional areas only QLD as a whole. Would love to see.
30. I work in rural health across Qld and there is a serious lack of access to support for children in need, particularly around education, social and psychological supports. Once a child has committed crime, you have missed the boat.
31. Finally, I found a person on reddit who understands how the economy and it's performance have a direct relationship to crime. Well done sir.
32. This also is impacted by other factors though such as police resourcing. Cost of living pressures also drive both crime in general and youth crime as well.
33. It's not. \*Reporting\* of it in the local media, however, is through the roof. This is what has got people convinced that there is a crime wave- they keep being told there is, so they believe it.
34. They‚Äôll say it‚Äôs getting better because our jails are full of low level offences such as first time drug possession ‚ù§Ô∏è
35. As an ex-foster kid, I hope so. I am keenly aware how fast that narrative can be pointed at us by gasbags in power.
36. Someone to gaslight you by showing you stats and telling you it's because the news is reporting on it more so you think it's worse when it's not in 3...2...1...
37. Even the previous Major got away with killing someone with her car!
38. stop voting in conservatives who don't do anything to improve families lives. your problem will be sorted
39. Totally agree. While I don‚Äôt agree with LNP‚Äôs ‚Äúadult crime, adult time‚Äù. It‚Äôs so weird that people are being down voted because they are saying crime is noticeably worse where they live. My experience is crime is noticeably worse where I live in the Wide Bay/Burnett region and it‚Äôs more than just media coverage. It‚Äôs personal experiences or family & friends experiences (like car theft and business fronts being smashed) that I would have never imagined prior to 2020
40. The statistics are saying ALP has improved the LNP effort on youth crime by 30% in spite of increased ability for reporting youth crime, and substantial population increase.
41. I don't know what you think can be done about the 25% of parents who hate their kids and either abuse or neglect them entirely.
42. 30% down Karen. 30%. LNP create crime, death and misery.
43. Completely don't disagree. My point is that the places where this message works, crime *is* up.
44. Poverty is not relevant. The youth crime crisis is mostly children breaking into houses to steal a car for a joy ride. The spending on Indigenous services is extremely high but it hasn‚Äôt gone to the right places
45. https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/queensland-crime-statistics/# That's overall crime. I can't find the link that had youth crime specifically, but someone compiled it, with sources, a couple of weeks back.
46. Erh as someone who lives in regional QLD. There is definitely more crime. Local businesses constantly being broken into. Car theft. I know someone who had their car stolen. They were just getting out of their car in their driveway. It‚Äôs really based around motor vehicle theft. Grandma stabbed to death in front of her granddaughter in the middle of the day at a local shopping centre because of vehicle theft. Uber driver killed, again the guys were originally just attempting theft. I‚Äôm not saying I agree with LNP but it‚Äôs definitely noticeable the spike in crime in my regional area at least. I‚Äôve lived here my whole life and it definitely was not like this prior to Covid.
47. No, actually I've seen the separated stats, independent of beat up. Since COVID there's been a sharp increase in crime and youth crime in Far North and North West regions. The increase is real, but the solutions are economic not legal.
48. Jails being full is how we get private prison, very lucrative in America.
49. You come live in Townsville and we‚Äôll see how you go‚Ä¶ crime may be down elsewhere but it‚Äôs worse here
50. Um what? Both Cairns and Townsville have had Labor representatives for years (until now), and Labor has governed in QLD for 30 of the last 35 years.
51. But why would they vote for the party who is literally denying what is happening?
52. Crimes commited by type, violent, ect. legal reform isnt keeping the same community expectations from 30 years ago and changing the severity, but listening to communities to realise a red herring isnt real
53. Lol. Nothing to do with the hundreds of 000 phone calls that go unanswered, due to police shortages, or youth not being charged or recorded, except in the extreme, then let off
54. The stats are per capita so increased population shouldn't really play a factor.
55. So that's good enough then? Lets just leave it at that and stop trying to improve things?
56. Children who are bored because their parents are absent often due to work, or depression/alcoholism due to lack of work, especially in indigenous communities. You're really highlighting the failure to understand root causes.
57. *Using regression analysis, poverty, single parent families and crowded dwellings were found to be the most likely explanatory variables for juvenile participation in crime." From Household income, neglect and juvenile crime report https://www.aic.gov.au/crg/reports/crg-1795-6
58. Queensland has self defense laws solid enough to rival some US states with stand your ground laws. You have every right to "fight back" you just can't carry around weapons in public >.> You have every right to use a weapon to defend yourself if you believe your life is threatened. You just can't chase them down the street. It's really just tired and boring that people keep dredging up this "i can't defend myself" nonsense. You can. Edit: [Here](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-10-09/qld-alva-beach-stabbing-deaths-families-vow/100524446) Kid kills two larger, fully grown men with a knife and the coroner's report even throws into doubt whether the second guy even made it into his home. Kid wasn't charged because he acted in self defense.
59. Move to the US where you get less police protection and get to shoot your gun.
60. I live in Townsville. I agree and am making fun of the people who tell us our eyes are deceiving us.
61. ALP might as well be a conservative to me mate
62. can I have a statement from an ALP member denying North Queensland crime?
63. no idea who that is. your references must be as outdated as your views
64. Alleviating poverty, teaching kids about consent and providing a better environment for kids to grow up in will all help, not enough is being done and I absolutely endorse anything that helps.
65. Also bored because theres nothing for them. Even sports are hard once you get over the range, the distances for games ect. Its not an easy fix but arresting them all and charging as adults seems to be a terrible idea
66. 9 years of labour government in QLD, why have they let those roots dig in?
67. They could‚Äôve been charging for graffiti & now don‚Äôt‚Ä¶who knows. Stats can always be manipulated‚Ä¶violent crime committed by youth could be up, whilst underage drinking it down‚Ä¶who knows from such broad stats.
68. It's only been three years of COVID recovery... That's where the spike began despite LNP nonsense.
69. Never said it couldn‚Äôt - old mate was saying read the graph for the answer‚Ä¶depends on the question‚Ä¶
70. Yep they just choose to show people the whole pitcure, this is from the report the graph is taken from. And the 2021-22 Queensland Crime Report showed a 13.7% increase in the number of children aged 10 to 17 being proceeded against by police, compared to the previous year. The total number of youth offenders reached 52,742, the highest number in 10 years.
71. Hey! we are getting it well done. Now back to the OPs point "city slicker stat. Come to Cairns and Townsville" He's suggesting this stat is worthless when there is huge crime increases in these areas, which is being ignored, because people are throwing this number out saying no actually crime is down. I mean the fact that this needs to be explained just means you are either really, really slow. Or disingenuous. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt Oh and if you want statements. Capalaba MP *Don Brown* claimed on Facebook that *youth crime* is all a "media beat up" But you can also just see the shilling posts on this sub daily saying that youth crime is down and not an issue.
72. So, I'm watching Channel 7 from outside Toowoomba for a few months last year and started to get really worried about the "youth crime crisis" that was reported nightly. I even considered buying a security camera. Then, one night, the head of police in Toowoomba comes on the news to say police data showed youth crime in the region had dropped by 20% over the past year. The news immediately returned to the presenter who, once again, said there was a "youth crime crisis". I then looked up the police data and saw youth crime (and other crime) had consistently fallen by 50% over the last 20 years. I hate being conned.
73. Literally because the media keeps pushing the narrative that it is. Be cynical of news outlets. Question not just the story but WHY they're doing whatever story. They're very politically inclined.
74. Technically, the raw total number of crime victims *has* increased. However, during the same time frame, the population has also rapidly increased. And although more people, in terms of raw numbers, are being effected by crime (LNP lens); crime victims as a percentage of the total population, has actually decreased (Labor lens), and looking at it as a percentage, is largely agreed to be better metric. A reductive example would be like looking at the fake statistic that 1 person in village of 10 people is a victim of crime in year 1. As a percentage, 10% of the population is effected by crime. By year 3, 20 more people move into the village, bringing the total population to 30 people. Another study is done (by the LNP) and it is then found that now 2 people in the village are effected by crime now. The LNP\media narrative is technically correct when they say the ‚Äònumber of people effected by crime‚Äô has doubled, or that the raw total number of people effect by crime has increased. But more examination is needed, because population has grown rapidly. Now 2 in 30 people are effected by crime (which as a percentage is only 6.67%). Ipso facto: the rate of crime in terms of the total population or per capita (per person) has actually decreased. It said that ‚ÄúAlthough artists use lies to tell a truth, politicians use the truth to tell a lie.‚Äù This is exactly what the LNP and their media allies are doing. They can technically spruik a truth ‚Äúcrime **numbers** (but forgetting to include as a raw total number) *are*, in fact, higher‚Äù. But in reality, it‚Äôs completely disingenuous. Because we all know most people would assume they mean crime as a percentage of the total population - which as I understand for Queensland population, has decreased. **TL;DR**: Although the raw number of people effected by crime might have increased, crime per capita has decreased (and is a more sensible metric). Source: Public sector data analyst
75. There are maybe half a million people in this state outside the SE corner affected by increased crime rates in general (Mt Isa, Townsville/surrounds and Cairns/surrounds). This subreddit is mostly SE QLD where there isn't any change or spike in crime so lots of posts on here saying it's all made up. It doesn't help win people over by consistently gaslighting FNQ and NQ where there is an obvious spike in crime RATES. [https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/queensland-crime-statistics/](https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/queensland-crime-statistics/) I know my (labour) MP (michael healy) who I have spoken with on this issue (after sustaining multiple break ins caught on camera) is aware of the issues and equally frustrated. Youth are an easy target for media as well, but I have been victimised by kids and adults alike, predominantly theft, attempted robery, vandalism and threats of violence walking home from work. There are inadequate resources to deal with the issues up here. I think this is due to the nature of being regional and remote - it is hard to get the specialist services up in these areas and the cost to deliver it up here is too great for such a small number of people. The resources available in Brisbane and GC are much greater.
76. We are dealing with cookers. Try having an argument with one.
77. This happened a little while ago with the ‚Äòice epidemic‚Äô. Does anyone remember that? Media and politics painted a picture that drug use was so out of control and ice was taking over the suburbs and citys, but in reality the group of people actively using drugs was actually decreasing but the amount those who were actually using was increasing (probably for many factors but tolerance is a big one). I see this ‚Äòyouth crime crisis‚Äô the exact same. Misinformation being skewed to paint a certain picture. It‚Äôs just fear mongering. If people did their actual research rather than buying into headlines we wouldn‚Äôt be falling for this crap. DV is a big one where reporting has significantly increased and our understanding as a population has improved in the last 5-10 years, but where is the outrage of this issue? People are so out of bent about a fake youth crime crisis but are not batting an eyelid over the countless women, children and men who are battling DV everyday. (PS very high majority young people who offend experience DV in some shape or form so maybe if we switch our focus *maybe* we might be able to help these kids from going down a life of crime, because let‚Äôs face it noone actually wants to be in and out of court and correctional facilities).
78. I have two mates in Townsville who have been broken into three times in the past few months. In all three cases items were stolen (car, electronics), the criminals either haven't been caught or when they have, they have been released. This is with security camera footage of youths with weapons, entering property etc. These events certainly makes it feel like in some parts of the state it is increasing. It's almost an unspoken part of being in North Queensland, a when rather than if, you will be burgled.
79. Statically it‚Äôs down state wide but you do have pockets in QLD especially in the north where it is a local issue. I do know people up in cairns who run businesses and have break ins, cars stolen etc. It is a genuine issue for regions like that. Couple that with some high profile cases, the Facebook group effect and you can easily paint it as an epidemic. At the end of the day, reporting on crime creates an emotional response. Especially when you give victims airtime. Statistics aren‚Äôt as powerful as a grieving woman. Mind you, it‚Äôs a complex issue. With deep seated social issues. The NT have being trying to solve it for years. The LNP are really kidding themselves thinking it‚Äôll be fixed in 100 days
80. How about leave your soy lattes in the city and go experiment the beauty of the youth aboriginal crime in north Queensland? Then tell me if it's down.
81. The qld media has been fabricating youth crime waves since the 1800's, it's just a thing they bullshit about.
82. People say media but I disagree, media is following a trend of awareness. Today people are perpetually online regardless of age, they‚Äôre in Facebook community groups that give them access to thousands of peoples experiences, so when someone is impacted by crime, instead of being limited to the people they personally know, they have the ability to tell thousands of people at once. So instead of hearing about negative events from exclusively friends and coworkers, you hear about it from complete strangers. So people are more aware of the amount of crime, but are making a false comparison to their historical awareness, but without recognising that the primary difference is access of information increased, not the actual crime. I don‚Äôt blame folk for not making this connection. For example, last year we had an issue with Qantas cancelling a flight, then rebooking my partner, but not our one year old onto the next flight then tried to ask if the toddler could make alternative travel arrangements, I was able to post this to reddit and over a thousand comments generated. A decade ago I‚Äôd of only been able to complain to those I knew, a much smaller outreach
83. Because the small percent of serious offenders are committing serious violent crime, repeatedly.
84. I wonder if there is an increase in youth offenders being in presentence custody and or sentenced to detention?
85. LNP-leaning media, eg. Sky News, pushing an agenda. Here's a link of actual crime stats: [Queensland Police Service release latest crime statistics for 2023/24 financial year - Queensland Police News](https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/news/2024/07/26/queensland-police-service-release-latest-crime-statistics-for-2023-24-financial-year/)
86. Referred to as a Moral Panic. It‚Äôs essentially the media (in this case Murdoch owned) pushing stories that influence the public to believe a certain negative or threatening narrative. In this case it‚Äôs about youth crime which benefits the LNPs stance even though crime overall is down. More frustrating is their proposed hardline approach costs more on a dollar per person basis than preventative and rehabilitative programs do.
87. Basically the total number of crimes committed is going up because the population has increased. However, the number of crimes per capita is going down
88. Because the media, which is complicit with the LNP tells them.iy is and they can't be bothered looking at the actual statistics
89. What's happening? The news report exaggerated or even made up topics to create a culture war so you are less likely to care about real issues such as housing, and billions being funnelled out of Australia to oligarchs
90. Yeah police just get sick of chasing, charging and watching them get set free, stop catching-stop the numbers
91. Depends on the measurement taken. Crime per capita might have decreased. But crime in total might have increased. All depends on how much the population has grown between results. It's one thing to say "crime has fallen by 20% per capita" but the population has increased by 200% (numbers I'm using don't reflect any actual data, just using as an example).
92. Is it down evenly across the state? If I live in a 11th floor apartment in Brisbane with a secure basement garage my exposure to the kind of crime being talked about is very different to living in a Queenslander in Mackay. I genuinely have zero idea on the facts here and the media beat up is primarily a scare campaign but is there some aspect of some people‚Äôs lived experience making it seem like things are getting worse for some people in some areas, maybe? When you are the one who buys a dud product the fact that you are the one in a thousand who were unlucky is not much comfort when going through the refund process. Again I have no idea and no barrow to push but maybe there is some interesting story hidden behind the wall of BS the media are feeding us. Or maybe not.
93. Because there's hundreds of youths cruising around the local suburbs on stolen motorcycle. So it's very visual. They are also all repeated offenders, so the perpetrators are down dramatically, but the recidivism rate is much higher.
