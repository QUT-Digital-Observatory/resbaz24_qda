Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. Yawn, looks like Labor are getting worried, trying all angles 🥱
2. To be fair the person referring him is Cameron Dick during an election campaign. You also need practically no evidence to refer someone to ethics committee. I’ll be interested to see the outcome nonetheless.
3. What better time to shine a spotlight on something... When everyone is paying attention? In fact, the bigger question is why hasn't anything been done about it before now? Oh, maybe because no-one was paying attention because it was quietly swept under the rug. But I suppose that's secondary to "why now" huh...
4. Probably like what is happening in the US with these late prosecutions against Trump - there isn't much in it but political point scoring. I have referred this/I have filed these charges, etc
5. How exactly is this post astroturfing? Value judgments aside, how does it meet that definition?
6. Sad LNP supporter wringing his hands and having a teary while throwing around baseless accusations and name calling. More news at 6.
7. Late? They've been prosecuting him for years. The only reason they're still going now is because Trump's entire legal strategy has been to do everything possible to delay them until after the election. He can't exactly cry about it when it's his fault it hasn't been sorted already.
8. Because a WordWordNumber username account doesn’t like this story, and they are definitely a real and genuine human and Queensland voter.
9. No those late charges - there were new ones that Smith bought just before the cut off for the election and there was a new one. Edit: may actually not be a new one but just reinstate charges that were previously tossed
10. Exactly. That was my initial point. Nobody cared about it until an Election came around. Labor would have been sitting on this for months just waiting for the right time to leak it.
11. No not at all. It's just being used as more ammunition in an increasingly ugly Election campaign.
12. Those aren't new, that's the secret documents case that just had to be refiled because the judge overseeing the case was also a big Trump fan and made a ruling that was just straight up terrible law to have the case dismissed.
13. To be fair, they've been banging on about it for the past couple of months. People just don't care for some reason, but they clearly think it's important enough to keep bringing up. The only real question is why if they've been banging on about it for so long did they only just refer him.
14. Agreed. But like I said, it's the perfect time to do it for a plethora of reasons.
15. Lol.....pretty sure we know the answer to your last sentence. Have a great evening.
16. Never fear, the Federal election is not far off! He can throw his hat in and have gone for the trifecta then!
17. Probably 800 cause he was the only independent. Sad is we don't have more independents running.
18. Humour me this? I thought certain things would exclude someone from running for office? Character, criminal history, those sort of things?
19. In the meantime you can read his 10 page book here to keep you busy https://www.amazon.com.au/BURN-BOATS-SHANE-CUTHBERT-ebook/dp/B0877386R6/ref=mp_s_a_1_6?crid=2JJZKAHXS53WU&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Zo4tRyhweTjcI1L9upawVHppz237OnWwCrnv2w3xn4MeDAdO8_yM4OVcFci_MN_8ov3ccyKqUtaoU9Xk-2A438_4XjgPTEuNp0C3EjvOOjEycr_-octFG-vEjP5w0YCrblzK9W7lOJ0WHoLvH5nG6BUq9f4kuXJPxnOSGD-DfT8p5aNa_b15tpXOpKq33P1Lxwmf2TpBNS4oclfAofIG_g.uRb4jM9l7gIBsbTD_j4O552LO5glweagUmqhgJkXg10&dib_tag=se&keywords=shane+cuthbert&qid=1730083359&sprefix=shane+cuthbert%2Caps%2C344&sr=8-6
20. Yeah, honestly, there were quite simply not a lot of options for the seat of Cairns. I heard he was reusing his signs from the last council election lol (Sustainable!) I volunteered handing out how to vote cards on 4 prepoll days and never saw or heard a peep from him, no corflutes or anything. So I can't imagine he was actually trying too hard this time.
21. According to the Parliamentary web site: "Persons presently not eligible for election to the Parliament include undischarged bankrupts, prisoners, Commonwealth parliamentarians and persons convicted of certain offences under the *Electoral Act 1992*. So, pretty limited rage of exclusions.
22. Just...wow... And apparently he's now a Harvard Graduate. In Justice and contract law.
23. As it should be. Can you imagine how easy it would be to become a dictator if all you had to do was make up a charge and have someone barred from office forever.
24. So not a cyclist? I fuckin hate cyclists. Think they own the road.
25. Wish there was more control over the graphs. Would be good to see a 'per 1000' trend as opposed to 'total count' trend (which will just scale with population growth). Might suggest accessing the QPS data instead, which take into account proportionality over a time-scale, as well being able to group by demographics and types of crimes.
26. Even with the decline in 2024 that has been reported. Qld has has an increase for the past years. Saying crime is in decline is like having a cold year and then people calling off climate change. And at the same time the rate of [offensese against a person increased](https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/news/2024/07/26/queensland-police-service-release-latest-crime-statistics-for-2023-24-financial-year/). Particularly for Juvanile crime. Honestly I don't really care about property crime. Yes people steal my shit, I feel a bit violated but I can buy it again. What I can't to is buy away the PTSD from the assult my wife went through. It is a bit of a [simpsons paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox) that yes, crime is down, but the crime that really matters is actually up. https://preview.redd.it/4fuj1j7od3xd1.png?width=1580&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5fb51d6166edbdcfed5aa2bbe8c2f73a57b7dee
27. Didn't even have to fire up R Studio. See [https://redsuburbs.com.au/lgas/cairns/](https://redsuburbs.com.au/lgas/cairns/) Similar to the state average violent crime is up everywhere which is alarming. Why is that? Cairns stands out in all areas as having dowble the crime normalised for population. The decrease in 2023 doesn't make me optimistic when looking at the 5 year trend. The line of best fit is like a plane taking off. If it was revenue growth the sahre price would be through the roof.
28. Best not to start the graph with the COVID dip though
29. Mareeba beats Cairns for everything except property crimes: https://redsuburbs.com.au/suburbs/mareeba/ Yarrabah is predictable: https://redsuburbs.com.au/suburbs/yarrabah/
30. You can see that is the histograms in the second row. But you are right, it is a better figure for comparison and gaining insight into what trends are happening. Would be good to see that over time.
31. I can let you know with 100% certainty that the reporting of crimes has changed especially in the domestic violence (DV) area. Previously, police would attend an incident of DV to investigate. If there was no criminal complaint of assault or wilful damage from the male/female aggrieved (victim) then the police will only proceed with a DV application to have a DV order out in place which is a civil matter and the reporting of that in the police database doesn't reflect the nature of the incident that occured. There would be no record of the violent crime or property offence that might have occurred that went unreported. Fast forward to around 2022ish a directive was issued that all incidents of DV that police attend MUST report the incident regardless of if the victim made a formal complaint. Police would proceed with a DV application and then create occurrences for the assault/property damage thereby recording them as statistics.
32. Population has increased and police laying more charges. What matters is crimes per capita and you'd have to account for changes in the charges being laid to know whether crime was actually worse.
33. Domestic abuse got reclassified as assault. Or rape as appropriate
34. There have been reclassifications of serious crimes. I get you are hurting, that’s totally normal. Traumatic events are difficult, it’s part of the process to have a hardening of your heart. I hope that you can try to focus more on the good things. It takes a strong person to remove personal pain from a complex issue. That will take time. Consider reaching out to community groups that do positive work, nothing will fill your hour heart more than actually helping some who is struggling. Endlessly looking for the one statistic that supports your argument, while actively ignoring the dozens of other metrics that disprove you, is an endeavour of self indulgence. This very report you have shown us here today shows a downward trend in two out of three categories of crime. At some point do you lend any weight to the downward metrics? Why do only the upticks matter? I hope you get some peace in the future, and I actively extend a hand to come and help within the community. Graphs and figures aside, you can help to make the community safer and kinder through your own efforts.
35. Go take a look at the other comments with 20 year data.
36. You can clearly see that n the QPS stats for 2022 and 2023. When looking I considered those to be an anomaly when considering 20 year trend.
37. Population has increased no where near that rate. Unless England has sent a convict ship again with their hardest criminals and settled them in Cairns it’s impossible for that change to be attributed to population increase. Does anyone know if cairns police practices are so different to other Australian cities to attribute to the cairns being double the Australian average as shown in the histogram’s with crime per capita?
38. “Why do the upticks matter”; Because the line of best fit is at about a 45 degree angle. Like I said if we have one cold year do we decide climate change is a hoax? My initial point was that cairns feels like crime is disproportionatly higher than other cities. The histogram shows it is double. Explain how the histogram showing crime per capita as double that of the Australian average is actually incorrect and cairns has the same crime as elsewhere.
39. Not arguing, just pointing out your pic in the initial post was flawed
40. My point wasn't that it was different from other jurisdictions, rather looking at comparisons to past cairns.
41. I’m not coming after you brother. I have no doubt that you “feel like cairns is more dangerous”. And that is a feeling. You are absolutely entitled to a feeling. It’s important to understand that [the red suburbs website is a business.](https://redsuburbs.com.au/blog/crime-api/) Its objective is to make money. The entire algorithm will be designed to inflate and emphasise differences. Draw striking comparisons and create a little dopamine rush when you can show a “big red spot” over a particular suburb to another. Hence, you go out and pay $2000 a year and you receive an online tool that can validate your fears and preconceptions. Your feelings are important, but this website can only bend facts so far. Please don’t pay for the subscription, it’s designed to make you afraid and to seperate you from your money. I hope you get some peace, and I hope you get back to a sense of saftey. Qld and Cairns itself is a tremendously safe place, and you deserve peace. But for now maybe working on being calmer and unwinding day to day is more important. Edit: looking forward to you smacking that downvote button. Always a highlight of our chats ; )
42. Yeah the the main point of the pic was the histograms
43. Do you have any evidence of that reclassification? Id like to investigate further.
44. The thing about it being a safe place, it is strange that most times I go into town I see a fight or people stealing shit. One time some indigenous drinking threw a bottle at my toddler. I fill up my car and people in the servo are tweaking out and struggling to wait in line for one person. Go to get pet food on a sat morning and police are moving on a group of drunk people at 8am. Just walking from dinner at a restaurant and some indigenous dude having a phychotic episode about the russian federation. On the way to drop kids at school there is a guy that camps out at the phonebox throwing shit at cars or just failing about most days (obvious drug phychosis). I feel safe. I'm a big guy. People don't mess with me. This is not about me feeling unsafe at all. It is undeniable that you can see a disproportionate rate of uncivalised behavior in cairns. I have never seen so much police activity in my life. I've lived for many years in the centre of Sydney, Bangkok, and London. I've woken up to some crazy shit outside my window. But it was a couple of times a year, nothing too much. Bike stolen once but never had to buy security cameras. Here it is pretty consistant; people run through your yard to escape cops, leave your door open for wind and someone tries to come in. Part of my ADD brain enjoys the freak show. My point here is that people who say Cairns is just like anywhere else are lying to themselves. The day shows that.
45. For starters always look at the values to orientate yourself. Then make a mental model of the change over time. [It is easy to skew a line on a chart](https://www.amazon.com.au/How-Lie-Statistics-Darrell-Huff/dp/0140136290/ref=asc_df_0140136290/?hvadid=712260449409&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=2093696931193425556&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1000347&hvtargid=pla-458238280732&psc=1&mcid=dcc3496b54e03cdcab7dacaac08d41b7&gad_source=1) you are correct. What algorithm are you refering to? You mean whatever they use to create a logistical model? If I look at other places I lived the model seems to[ show low crime and a decline](https://redsuburbs.com.au/suburbs/eastwood-nsw/). How does their business model survive by just trying to get people in low socio-economic areas to pay an exorbidant rate? Seems unsustainable. You can ease your worries about me losing money. I'm a software engineer with 25 years experience and 2 post grads in data science, I'm not going to pay for something I could do myself.
46. I know some violent crimes had been reclassified, but I don't practice criminal law in Australia and I haven't seen any specific numbers.
47. Your day shows that. Your day, your perception, your feeling, fair enough. But, the figures are going down.
48. Then why are you leaning on a site that has an undisclosed [sophisticated algorithm](https://redsuburbs.com.au/blog/what-skews-and-distorts-suburb-crime-statistics/) “How does Red Suburbs handle these skewed and distorted suburbs? We use a sophisticated algorithm that identifies and puts a rank cap on such suburbs. This means that we do not rank them higher than they deserve based on their actual crime rate. We also provide detailed information about each suburb, such as its population, area and types of crimes reported. This way, you can analyse each suburb in depth and think about what factors can affect its crime statistics and drive its numbers up.” We have no idea how the site comes to its conclusions.
49. I’ll look into it. The jump in 2022 and 2023 looks like it could be attributed to that.
50. Every time we go into town I see some shit pretty much. See shit in edge hill, Whitfield, M suburbs. I don’t get out to beaches or down south that much. So I’m primarily around inner suburbs of cairns. Funnily enough I haven’t seen crime at Raintrees, just drunken antics.
51. As per the police stats website they are down for the quarter to june 2024. That does not mean a downward trajectory when looking at longer term but we all hope that continues. But again that is irelevant. We are talking about per capita incident rate compared to other cities.
52. Just for September and October this year in Cairns - 6 children aged 11, 8 children aged 12, 8 children aged 13, 10 children aged 14, 18 children aged 15, 14 children aged 16, and 6 children aged 17 on a total of 303 charges. Armed robbery with violence, break and enter, stealing cars, driving dangerously, and drug and weapon possession are the main charges. The figures are going down? Really?
53. https://preview.redd.it/nnd35lavb6xd1.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=485db67f82d295dafb0c189e60d57eecda99bb82 See from 2019 to 2020 crime was down. I'm sure there were articles written about it and you keep saying it on reddit. But then 2022 was up from both of them and 2023 more again. Crime rate will vary, just like yearly weather will, but the long term trajectory is what is important. As I said before we don't have a cold year and then decide global warming is defeated. [https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/queensland-crime-statistics/](https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/queensland-crime-statistics/) This is rates though.
54. But I'm not looking at the ranking so this is irelevant.
55. https://preview.redd.it/pgapwbw9e6xd1.png?width=1890&format=png&auto=webp&s=24f67cd958b377f80385adf0eb39fb195baa5488 Looking at rates rather than numbers and Cairns rather than QLD. 2024 is less than 2022 and 2023 but higher than previous years. It is not clear how the rates are calculated though. It is hard to get real population data as well. Looking at numbers it is a definite increase. But we are trying to normalise to population here so that is not relevant to look at. [https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/queensland-crime-statistics/](https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/queensland-crime-statistics/)
56. Have you considered a move to Rye Park? I hear it’s quite safe.
57. Like the weather, I prefer to look outside at real life. 16 cars stolen on the weekend, nothing to see here.
58. I'm not looking to move. You keep ignoring the per capita offence rate compared to other cities to support your world view. Why is that?
59. [three minutes to explain why crime seems worst than it is for you. have a good one mate.](https://youtu.be/jOjIAiJCNIk?si=jLCn-LhEllP4i4U_)
60. I haven't got any yet, but I don't want any. I wonder whether they're targeted - did you register with any party, perhaps by responding to one of their 'surveys'?
61. All mine have been from the Liberal Party. So annoying.
62. i've had them from both sides, how do they get our numbers?
63. Liberal party sends me emails without an unsubscribe link. I don’t know how they get away with it.
64. I haven’t received any, I wonder if it’s because I voted early?
65. I wish they’d change the laws, so they can’t call you and be annoying, I also would like for them change the laws to say if “I don’t want to vote” because I prefer not to vote for these idiots but apparently it’s mandatory
66. I feel the same way about political advertising. The labor ads have been constant on TV - I'm so sick of them. And considering they can use OUR money, I think it's disgraceful [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-02/qld-mps-use-taxpayer-funded-allowances-for-billboards/104419392](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-02/qld-mps-use-taxpayer-funded-allowances-for-billboards/104419392)
67. Definitely not. I would never associate with LNP, and that's where all the spam has been coming from.
68. Nope. I hate politicians. bunch of over paid bullies that only look out for themselves.
69. I have got a couple. I didn't see them cause my phone automatically classed them as spam and blocked them.
70. I had a representative for Ally King (ALP member for pumicestone) actually ring me last night.
71. It's Governments. They know our numbers and all our personal information. It's probably from the ATO. I do know that some years back when they updated privacy legislation and created "Do Not Call" registers etc that they specifically exempted election political messaging from political parties from any opt out provisions. I assume it was created at the Federal level and probably propagated and adopted down through State and most likely Local Council level. Something like that. The main message is they can spam you with election messages and recordings and you have no recourse to opt out or complain.
72. i voted early but i've received them since i voted from both sides ...
73. same with mine, but it keeps that little icon up the top saying i have a new message.
74. well lucky us lol but thanks for the informative reply! :)
75. Don't know what you mean by "beggars can't be choosers", it's a wonderful place.
76. It's completely fine and an area a lot of people love loving in. Lots of hospital staff and retirees.
77. Oh no a fairly high income area, high levels of home ownership, with decent accessibility, close to all amenities *and* the beach. What a terrible place to be forced into. Personally I would rather live in my car than live in such a place.
78. I lived there for a few years, it's ok albeit a bit boring. And yes, the biggest issue there is parking (and travelling via Nicklin Way, I hate Nicklin Way with a passion).
79. The parking is absolutely horrendous and the fact residents have to pay for a parking permit otherwise you'll get a fine from Sunshine Coast Council
80. Ok great. Sorry, I wasn’t casting judgement, I was more referring to how built up it is in the area.
81. A parking permit to park on the street? Do you know what that’s worth?
82. You can check out the Birtinya community group on f/book, it will give an insight. Street parking during the day is the biggest issue because of the hospital.
83. Yes to park on the street ridiculous I know and with the parking permit obviously doesn’t guarantee you a spot to park on the street so essentially paying to maybe get a car park every afternoon Last time I paid for it in June this year was around $47 from memory you have to lodge online application with council I believe the area is truely overpriced especially with the recent crime in the area we choose to move away
84. Since they made the whole area 2p I haven’t had any issues parking since getting a permit. Bit more annoying when friends or family are visiting though.
85. Oh right. I haven’t heard about the crime. What specifically?
86. This guy has the worst photos for his placards. Always looks constipated.
87. "located a shovel, axe, gloves, duct tape, ropes and a cadaver bag."... Let's not jump to any conclusions.
88. I remember this guy! I reported him to the electoral commission for saying he was running as an independent when he was actually a candidate for Fraser Anning!
89. > Police allege they found weapons and camouflage clothing inside a car belonging to Mr Jessop. > It is also alleged that during a further search of the vehicle officers located a shovel, axe, gloves, duct tape, ropes and a cadaver bag. And he was given bail! What was hus excuse? He got the Halloween weekend wrong and he was getting ready to go trick-or-treating?
90. Off topic but relevant to the sub: I met a guy today that calls it "shine shine coast" and that was incredibly funny
91. The cashier at Bunnings: “Got a little project for the weekend hey?”
92. consider me completely unsurprised next you'll be telling me he's anti-vax and promoting crypto
93. *bro day dreaming about projecting a 2x4 into his neighbours head* : Yeah mate, something like that!
94. I've only been herping once up here near crystal creek. I'm not reptile nerd and am not very knowledgeable on the subject but my partner and I found 6 different species of tree frog and various other frogs, geckos, snakes and a few other interesting critters including a Coremiocnemis tropiix in the middle of eating a small tree frog.
95. I googled it, so apparently "Herping is the act of searching for amphibians or reptiles.[1][2] The term, often used by professional and amateur herpetologists, comes from the word "herp", which comes from the same Greek root as herpetology, herpet-, meaning "creeping". The term herp is a shorthand used to refer to the two classes of ectothermic tetrapods (i.e., amphibians and reptiles).[3]" Heaps of geckos hang around near my outside lights, I'll leave it on Might see some goannas or a croc if you hike the swamp at pallerenda, been a bit dry though
96. BHP black headed python and spotty is a spotted python I believe.
97. You put the what in the who now? Glad commenters commented!
98. Here I was thinking you're after some kind of dr*gs 😂
99. Out at the JCU is a good place for snakes. Plenty of carpets not sure about Bhps though. The town common is another one out at Pallerenda. You would have to walk in there.
100. OP is asking where's the best place to look at wild reptiles. Herpetology certainly isn't a new field haha.
101. I thought that too - sure if you rooted around Thuringowa you'd get herpes!!!
102. I have seen a few posts I think were on here and Facebook about a few regular herpers up here who are posting their reptile finds semi regularly.
103. Just exposing my ignorance to the world then. Hepatology, got ya. I just assumed, being Reddit, I just assumed it was a sex thing that I didn't understand.
104. That was my first thought too, I only even know about it because I found one of those legless lizards in my back yard once and went down a google rabbit hole.
105. I killed many a herptile in Red Dead Redemption 2
106. Kirwan is fine....If you live on the correct side of Thuringowa drive.
107. Then my experience of moving up here 5 years ago and living in West End, and now Garbutt, is that there’s no difference really between here and anywhere else I’ve lived in Australia. We’ve never had a break in or any property damage so 🤷‍♂️
108. Your first mistake was thinking Kirwan was Central. Central to what!?
