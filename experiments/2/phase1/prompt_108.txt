Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Yeah but I’m an 80s baby I’m not a plastic surgery, steroid filled gym junkie. Tbh it’s been hard growing up here & having a European family, trying to keep up with the trends when my family couldn’t afford it. I don’t even have a single tattoo. Never been married, no kids, I’m a sad case lollll
2. Yes, not all, much higher quantity though. Usually evident when watching sporting teams compete…
3. "I love Hitler, I have drinks with him every Sunday" (this is a joke, I am not saying the LNP are Hitler-esque, but man... people and their politics, hey.)
4. The LNP is the party of equal opportunity - the women are at least as awful as the men.
5. Objectively wrong information and also irrelevant to my comment regardless. White young men have had a moderate swing to conservative, literally everyone else that isn’t that has shifted even further left.
6. That’s strictly in America and even then is using warped data (per capita by state rather than overall). Gen Z may be slightly more conservative than Gen Y, but compared to Gen X and the Baby Boomers are still strongly leftist as a global population, but also specifically in Australia.
7. You don't live on the GC, so it's kind of a win for them too.
8. Yeah okay, that makes sense given Europe’s shift, America’s shift, south America’s shift, and the fact that the ALP’s vote isn’t growing. But keep on underestimating conservatives and insulting those who have a different view to you, it makes it so much easier
9. Of course... I'm currently in Canberra, so I get the best of all worlds. Each year I get to choose to visit GC, Brisvegas, or some other place like Townsville/Cairns... I usually choose Townsville. The weather is warmer and there is a lower tourist density.
10. Tell me you live a sheltered life without telling me you live a sheltered life.
11. How is it the fault of the victim? Stupid question.
12. Is it just me or is the OP just a DH trying to stir up trouble. Appears very disrespectful to me.
13. Can you please take, more or less of the drug/s you are currently on.
14. The problem is, you guys actually believe that the only reason Labor lost was boomers. In reality, Queensland has a sizeable percentage of young people who vote along conservative lines. The reason you don’t realise that, is because most of the time, if one of them comes out as a conservative, the ever intolerant left like you will socially ostracise them. This doesn’t come into consideration when they go to the ballot box though
15. You seriously believe a sizeable majority of Regional Queensland went to university?
16. See this is helpful I just find the reliance on the government to stop this wild I just got dogs and a carport
17. Yeah us kids of tradesmen and healthcare workers renting in flood zones are living the dream
18. I don't think OP realises how much the kids have evolved over the years. A decade ago they were only getting in through unlocked house doors and stealing the car keys and whatever else they take a liking to with no gloves or masks to hide their identity. Now, at least up here, they are covered up and use gloves, and bring tools and weapons with them to bust through locks, even cutting and/or removing window security screens. Would also be highly likely that youth crime is being under reported, possible severely, when they do everything they can to mask their identities, unless they admit to any other crimes they've done when being caught for one, which I highly doubt. But of course. It's my fault my house was broken into and our cars stolen apparently. Both our cars were abandoned, luckily not torched, and they never caught the ones that did our place, at least last time I requested information.
19. They do teach economics though, and to protect your assets
20. Which is why so many of us are paying private security to patrol our neighbourhoods. Super normal state.
21. Australia is bought and sold by wealthy and powerful lobbyists just like the USA.
22. So basically this sets up Dutton as the next PM :(
23. Perhaps now is a good time for that royal commission into Murdoch media ownership????
24. if only Albanese had some power to try to change the circumstances of what companies could do in terms of campaigns, alas he is only the prime minister and powerless to change anything.
25. If you are a battler and voting with the big mining , business and industry groups, then you get what you deserve
26. If you use “Australian minerals council” and “nonpartisan” in the same sentence without a punchline, **you’re the fucking joke**.
27. Good, the country is going to shit with the direction labor is sending it.
28. All this while the Union movement fund the ALP campaigns
29. Albanese is already in the pockets of mining corporations. The fake competition between liberal and Labor is just a containment strategy designed to trick people into thinking there is some difference between ALP and LNP when both are puppets for mining companies.
30. Does Sky news do all your thinking for you. The ultimate in outsourcing.
31. Funny, it wasn’t external advertising that convinced me to vote LNP - it was the social media crap that the last premier was posting all over Twitter.
32. Albo is cooked. Miles was useless too but at least he was semi likeable.
33. >Australia is bought and sold by wealthy and powerful lobbyists ~~just like~~ from the USA. Ftfy
34. A man I worked with for many years often said that Australia has the best politicians money can buy.
35. If so, then might be time to buy shares in mining companies and Murdoch owned media. If you can't beat 'em, might as well have some of their money in your own pocket.
36. This is true though right? He doesn't hold a majority government in the senate and thus can't actually pass laws the greens don't agree with. (I don't know much about how the senate works, what things can he do without the need to go through the senate?)
37. An unemployed former airline CEO in your corner. Now that's amore.
38. Funny... because it's LNP that wants to scrap mining royalties. Not Labor.
39. Both parties have their faults. But Labor is objectively better than LNP in the department of being influenced by lobbyists.
40. Are you saying that you would vote for whoever regardless of policy if you don't like someone's social media
41. Awesome how you put so much effort into looking for, reading and comprehending the various policies the political parties were offering, allowing you to make an informed decision before voting. Oh wait, you didn't do any of that. There are soooo many stupid people around it's not funny.
42. Okay... But my social media was flooded with LNP adverts. So, I'm not sure how Labor was any worse 🤔🤷‍♀️
43. Sometimes, it's best to keep your mouth shut and let people wonder if you're a moron. Instead, you chose to remove all doubt.
44. You are right about the senate numbers, except the Greens literally introduced a bill over a year ago for the same subject - https://greens.org.au/news/media-release/greens-introduce-bill-murdoch-media-royal-commission
45. Democracy only works if people know what they are voting for.
46. 16 years from now? Sounds like a problem for a different government.
47. He will commit crimes again, and be imprisoned by a private contractor owned by Crisafulli's children.
48. Only "blue collar" crime. Wage theft, environmental vandalism, corruption etc will all still be rewarded as per LNP doctrine.
49. Yeah that is pretty much it. When your young, and have come from a fucked family, you pretty much lack any sense of a future or really what you should be doing with your life. Thus far more likely to make bad mistakes and fall into wrong crowds etc. So then being thrown into jail, where you will not learn to move out of that cycle, yeah what the fuck do you do when you get out, and have spent your youth learning only how to be a bitter criminal from the others, as well as becoming even more fucked up from the shit that happens in prison. "Tough on crime" approachs dont work in isolation, but that is often what they do because it feels good. Your just putting the problem away out of sight, and kicking it down the can and often making it worse. People dont often tend to avoid crime because they think of the consequences of getting caught, because they dont think about getting caught or even care till they face them. You need to give people a reason to be better, and a future that seems obtainable. Otherwise what is the point, live fast die young. So no, it wont. And there will be a lot of abuse cases from these kids being put places they shouldnt be. Guarantee, Would not be surprised if a donner owns some private bloody prisons.
50. It won't. There's no evidence that increased sentencing reduces likelihood of reoffending. QLD already locks up nearly more kids than NSW and Vic combined, and our juvenile offender rate is just a high
51. I am not on any political side or advocating for the policy but let me try and explain it as I see it. 1) this is actually more of a ideological viewpoint. The punishment is the deterrent as well as being an actual punishment for an offender. So the “adult time” puts off those who may do crime in the future - because they don’t want the harsher punishment than the current one. I am not saying it works compared to anything else. Just saying the view behind it. 2. you’ll need to wait for the policy and legislation to see what the actual punishments are. Presumably it’s an increase in prison sentences and starting earlier - so less juvenile detention centres and more prison I would guess & longer terms with less suspended sentences. Although as far as I know you have the separation of powers here, so the judiciary still decides what punishment an offender receives but I presume there will be changes as to more severe punishments available. Once again before anyone jumps on me - I am not advocating for anything. I have not said anything about rehabilitation because as far as I know that’s not part of this policy. I am not advocating for LNP or Labour. Just trying to answer OPs question.
52. They'd have to repeal a bunch of sentencing legislation that says, among other things, jail should always be a last resort (including for adults). They'd also have to hope that the courts feel the same way. We have this little thing called separation of powers that basically means the government can't just tell the courts what to do so there are some checks and balances
53. In reality the LNP will lift the max sentence for a bunch of serious crimes, which sounds good to its base, but achieves very little as judges will still have their discretion. There are very few sentencing options open to the childrens courts - detention, probation, parole, and restorative justice/conferencing - so kids need to commit a heap of offences before they can hit the bench mark for detention. It gives the impression of a slap on the wrist but the truth is that most kids are scared straight after their first interaction with the courts. There are hundreds who are not scared straight and I think there should be a middle ground, like community service or mandatory GPS trackers, that can be applied to kids who do commit serious crime but don’t hit the benchmark for detention. As for murder, most children who commit murder are truely messed up children who have been abused from birth and come from seriously violent homes. The need intensive support during and after detention. Locking them for most of their 20s is inhumane and only serves to create a worse criminal. Do yourself a favour and search the Supreme Court library for children’s court of Queensland rulings for murder. They are some of the most depressing stories you’ll ever read.
54. I think most of the children they see in youth crime are repeat offenders. They will be given opportunities to rehabilitate and earn an education in “detention centres” is what I heard. I know grown ass man that have gotten away with crime after crime until finally the judge had enough and put them in jail. So I don’t expect that a kid that does one wrong thing will end up in a detention centre for a whopping sentence. It will depend on the charge severity and the history of the offender.
55. They come out, reoffend, and go back in for another stint. Easy. I think we need some more severe punishment for kids running around stealing cars, breaking into homes armed with machetes and whatnot. Those kids need attention. Do they need to spend their entire lifespan (up until that point) behind bars during critical developmental periods? Probably not. We need better intervention, and suitable 'punishments' that will shape better future citizens. Forced volunteer work, job programs, civics classes, assistance with education, alternative approaches to education, practical classes for trade skills, how to earn and generate money (legally). As many point out, these kids come from less than ideal backgrounds. I don't think anyone is expecting a kid stealing a loaf of bread to do 5 years in adult gaol, but people want results. In these days of social media, being a little thug and stealing someone's car, while recording and posting to Snapchat is seen as an ideal for many to pursue. People expect change. You can point to statistics all you want, but youth crime is very prevalent, people are intimidated, lots of young people have respect issues. Go sit in a year 9 class and tell me there isn't a problem at the moment. These issues are caused by the environment though, so we need to build a better environment to raise young people. Putting them into a much worse environment is not going to help. Shit inputs = shit outputs.
56. You're assuming that Liberal voters have even thought about the long-term consequences of their vote.
57. The point is that the current approach towards 14yos who intentionally do really horrible things isn't working, and people feel that justice is not being served. More importantly, there seems to be a perception among "off the rails" young teenagers that they're more or less untouchable from a legal standpoint. No-one *seriously* thinks that a 14yo who engages in some run-of-the-mill shoplifting should be thrown in jail for years and years. It's obviously intended to refer to very serious crimes where it should have been obvious, even to a teenager, that it was not only wrong but likely to cause someone's death or serious, life-altering injury.
58. But the LNP said they won’t change the law. They didn’t specify which law. So no laws will change? What kind of government prevents themselves from passing legislation. What a farce.
59. People voted for a change. They think a magic wand will make all the bad stuff go. Let’s see how it all looks in a year though.
60. It won't work. It's a short-term band-aid approach aimed at winning votes. Punitive measures have little deterrent value. To be honest, free school lunches would have a larger effect on reducing juvenile crime long term - it keeps kids engaged at school, one of the key drivers in reducing offending.
61. >It feels like a recipe for creating hardened criminals, even predators Sadly, justice professionals have known since the 80s/90s quite definitively that this is exactly what it does. Its not at all controversial, this is settled amongst people who spend their lives studying and working int the justice sector. They obviously aren't going to be voting for this. Don't be fooled by the LNP election campaign: nobody actually believes it will actually work. So-called "tough on crime" campaigns aren't about solving crime. Never have been. Its about perception and campaign branding. They're just about getting cynical politicians elected. Nothing more. And you still have these absolute suckers and losers falling for it nearly every election cycle despite the mountains of evidence it doesn't work. Exact same campaign was just run by NZ's National party a little while back, and it worked there too (to get them elected that is). They're currently in govt absolutely slashing and burning the public service ... you're next QLD ... So if you want to know how QLD will do ahead of time, watch how NZ does under a carbon copy of QLD's govt WRT their approach. Hell, take a look at the US throughout the early to mid 90s when they tried a similar experiment via Clinton's Crimes bill. Remember: noone can claim top be tough on crime if they're laughably weak on poverty: your central key driver of crime And who is the biggest weaklings in Australia when it comes to poverty? The LNP *by far*
62. Today the libs announced a budget black hole and cut 200 million from Queensland Police, you got what you voted for, enjoy.
63. You’ve forgotten the “for profit” prisons in the hands of private companies, I’m sure it’s a system that will work well and have the offenders best interests at heart…../s
64. It won’t because even adult time is just people being let off numerous times for serious offences. Magistrates refuse to be governed or told how to run their courts so the LNP can try like last time but it’ll probably result in the magistrates collectively telling them to fuck off
65. I can't believe Australia politics have fallen the winner has the best fear mongering instead of promoting the best policies. I vote but fuck it's hard to remain positive
66. There's a fair bit of detail on their website: [https://online.lnp.org.au/youthcrime](https://online.lnp.org.au/youthcrime) When the link above become unavailable [here's the Internet Archive version](https://web.archive.org/web/20241004065525/https://online.lnp.org.au/youthcrime). I'm not an LNP voter. I believe they put too much faith in the open market to deliver efficiencies and innovation. But the information on their own website does not align with the simplistic "adult time adult crime" slogan. In the run up to the next election we should check whether they've implemented each of the bullet points on that page and whether that's had a positive impact on the lives of everyone in Queensland (even the criminals).
67. Every expert I've heard has said it is a terrible idea. But as you say it seems great if you want to create hardened criminals. The current government will be retired by then though.
68. Overreporting on violent crimes creates fear in the constituency. Using a simple slogan that reflects an intuitive, but wrong, position that harsh sentencing is the most effective way to reduce crime appeals to a sense of justice that most people can respond to and helps alleviate the fear that was created by a media that manfucatured teh consent in the first place. Your opponents rely on expert advice and research into the causal factors to crime, but because you have already done the ground work to weaken social services, and the idea that the government should do things for people as 'socialism', they aren;t able to commubnicate the complex ideas that lead to better outcomes in a snappy slogan AND they have to try and dispel the fearmongering resulting in a less compelling position when it gets covered by the media. You win the election in large part because of this 'tough on crime' stance that actually is less less effective at reducing crime, but that's ok because your real goal was to become the government to deregulate and enrich businesses under the guise of a 'productivity comission' which is just a euphonism for letting businesses profiteer without worrying about livable homes, climate change or workers rights. That's how 'adult crime, adult time' works.
69. You’ve hit the nail on the head. 50+ years of research out of the US *alone* has proven emphatically that ‘tough on crime’ only makes crime worse. Referring to ‘youth crime’, a combination of diversion and rehabilitation is what works. ‘Tough on crime’ wins votes and fills prisons, it doesn’t reduce crime.
70. Its a breeding system for hard criminals. So what happens is a child/young guy makes a poor choice (or a few) and the liberals lock them up in an school that teaches them how to be actual hard criminals. Those hard criminals eventually get out.. 1000x worse crimes and more of them and it scares the racists fuckwits so they continue to vote LNP and its a vicious cycle. The ALP had all time low crime and it was progressing lower but that doesnt help LNP win elections.
71. It's not supposed to be dealt with by then, silly. It's supposed to win them power *now*.
72. Theyre hoping labour is in gov at the time, so they can blame this wave of hardened criminals on them
73. Its only for aboriginal kids! Wealthy white kids who get fueled up on dads drug cashe will get suspended sentences and time off for good behaviour
74. Prisons are just factories that produce‘better’ criminals. But the conservatives won’t mind that - they just be able to run on law and order ad infinitum
75. The research says that it doesn't work. It buys votes from the ignorant.
76. Well it won’t. It’s a dog whistle to those who like a law and order (almost Trumpian) approach to the complexities of life or who are comfortable with imposing penalties on the less fortunate. It meets the needs of those who struggle with change and think simple, one line solutions work for complex situations. It’s in breach of our obligations for children as a signatory of the UN convention on the rights of the child, it will unfairly impact the less fortunate, able, rich in society including First Nations children. I could go on !
77. My understanding is we are reintroducing public beatings of children. That’s a paddlin’.
78. It's a really good question when you consider Crime was historically low under Labor.
79. Tough on crime policies simply dont work, they enrich companies like serco and GSL who lobby government. They also provide convenient platforms for right wing governments to campaign on. It has been proven that every dollar spent on crime prevention (community welfare and support, family support and intervention) reduces downstream costs by 17 dollars. Some crime is inevitable, but addressing the cause of crime is cheaper and societally better than locking up kids in places they will only learn how to commit worse crimes when released It seems there is no government tough on environmental crime, wage theft, fraud, or other white collar crimes. Why not?
80. Studies show that shorter sentences focused on rehabilitation are far more effective for young offenders than longer jail terms. Programs offering education, mental health support, and life skills training greatly reduce the risk of reoffending, while longer incarceration only increases this risk by disrupting their development and exposing them to negative influences. Emphasizing support over punishment is a proven way to help these young people build better futures and reduce crime in our communities.
81. This question assumes that the LNP actually has a workable policy. Adult time for Adult Crime won't work.
82. It’s absolutely criminal to be treating children like adults. I understand that the children we are talking about have committed some pretty abhorrent crimes, but you’re absolutely right. These kids will go to prison & come out better criminals. I don’t know what the solution is. I’m not smart enough to figure that out, but the fact that our lawmakers are ignoring decades of research & data that states that lowering the age of criminal responsibility is bad makes me think that maybe I’m smart enough to be a politician.
83. ‘Straya a brutal colony still. We have only recently witnessed the Northern Territory police and jailers treating young children like animals and the Queensland government already wants to take us back there. And the Queensland people just gave them that right.. Having said that the northern territory are also going back down that path. The people of Northern Territory gave the government that right as well.
84. Oh do you think anything is going to change under the libs? The only thing that will actually change, is the reporting of youth crime. It is going to go very quiet very soon.
85. I have no idea why they were pushing this as one of their main selling points when the country has so many issues rn. Why not focus on lowering the cost of living or something we can all relate to 🤦🏼‍♀️
86. Harsh sentencing is not about reducing crime, it's about increasing votes and increasing clicks.
87. It's just bullshit. The crime "crisis" was made up, or at least grossly exaggerated. Youth crime has dropped significantly over the past decade. Of course, very few people obviously bothered to fact check the bullshit fear mongering the LNP and crapitalist media put out in order to gain more power, so here we are. Even if there was a crime problem, the LNP wouldn't do anything about it. All the Libs and Nats do is help their big business mates screw over the public more than they already do.
88. TL;DR every criminologist in the world knows punitive measures don’t work and populist nonsense is only supported but conservative, braindead idiots
