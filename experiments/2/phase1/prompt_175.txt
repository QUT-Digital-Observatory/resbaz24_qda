Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. Labour got what they deserved. Will the liberal be any better? Yeah, we'll see in 4 years.
2. Damn looks like buying a abandoned house in Japan is happening sooner then I thought won’t be able to afford rent now come next week
3. I'll need to learn Russian because Crisafulli would sell our state to the Russian interests sooner or later. It'll come handy.
4. I’m a Laborite all the way, but even I’m getting the popcorn out.
5. This, I hate the result, I live in NQ, but this is democracy. We are the only state that has more population living outside the capital then within it, the regions hold power and they are swing seats now. Towns turned Blue that didn't even go in the Newman landslide, this is a very big lesson that ALP should take a lot of notes on.
6. This is an all too reasonable reply which doesn’t fit here. The campaigning on these pages has been an embarrassment with foot soldiers making any discussion impossible. Hoping things get a bit more reasonable. No matter the colour of the party, a decade is long enough. Unfortunately scare campaigns are now the standard - so much so that people believe them because they are repeated enough
7. 100% correct answer. The people here complaining about the end of the world don’t seem to realise there were a bunch of people who felt the same way last time Labor won. Both groups are guilty of catastrophising.
8. Yes but can we all survive that long? And if we manage to, how long will it take to recover?
9. Pretty much. Once Dave's on TV and we'll known, he will be hated a lot more. There's a lot of reasons why they played a small campaign.
10. Inevitable. But, alas. Not as bad a loss as expected a month ago, and people will hate Dave I reckon pretty darn quickly.
11. Curious, deserved? Why? Honestly, we had a government that did a steady run of policies to tackle the cost of living crisis in a manner that didnt drive up inflation (cutting costs of things like energy, transport, rego, could have been free school lunchs that would pull a ton of kids out of poverty and allow them to be far more productive citizens as they grow up, etc) rather than just throwing money as a stimulus, and seemed to make all the right moves other than not owning a media monopoly and liquifying any suspicious looking youths on sight. It was expected they would lose, but not really a good reason for them other than vibes.
12. Not even a leftie, voted LNP my whole life until Campbell Newman fucked the state. Labor are the most centrist and balanced party. Greens voters are what I would consider “lefties”
13. the explosion of the housing market happened entirely under the labor government...
14. It's all entertaining watching people cope about things they care about. But the knowledge that people will unnecessarily suffer, die, and we will atrophy as a state and not have nice things, is a bitter pill to swallow. Politics matters and there's a lot of reasons people care about it. Which includes general empathy for others, and understanding what you get from a decent government. Personally making/saving an extra 3 to 4 this year because of ALP policies, massive reduction to public transport costs, not paying power for months, tax cuts, and pay raises to help catch up with inflation. Not to mention a job that almost tripled my income because of their policies. (And put me in an amazing workplace, and able to be a lot more social now). Compared to the LNP, when we almost lost everything as a family because of their cuts.
15. I really hope they do learn from this. There were just swings everywhere. It was really not the question of who of the two was better really but ALP campaigning wasn’t any better. If anything they sounded more fear mongers than their counter parts. At least they stopped bringing Russell’s story as campaign material. I wasn’t seeing in my YouTube ad from last couple of weeks or so. It was that crying woman which tbh wasn’t an easy on ears as well but yeah at least it wasn’t as uncomfortable and the person was still alive. My heart breaks every time I’m thinking of the man and what happened to his son and his family. Anyway, not seeing much getting changed but at least a reminder the world is for people and people living in it. If you cannot calm a common person’s concerns, someone who sells better would do that. Whether they do anything effective or not, it’s a separate debate and only time can tell.
16. Yeah I was really embarrassed and quite annoyed at the scare campaign ads from both sides. Far out every new YouTube video can’t be started without the ads. I’m glad the ads would be gone at least now.
17. Yeah it won’t be ideal, I bet Coles and Woolies will lower prices now making people think lnp is doing it, just so they get more tax cuts and remain a duopoly
18. They failed to properly communicate exactly how they were going to deal with many tough issues and after Palascuk flatly abandoned them, Miles' bribery campaign is too little and too late. People must be asking why now? They see a fractured, stale and indecisive party and the conservatives flatly exploited that. It's too little too late for them. As someone that's firmly planted far left, they've done nothing but piss me off. As for youth crime, the system is in much worse shape than we are led to believe publicly (not just talking about crime). None of them, including federally, are doing what's necessary on that front. And now over the next 4 years we can enjoy the fostering of a generation of career criminals and more serious crime in the years to come. Labour deserved to lose because they have failed real progressives and now everyone will be reminded of what that looks like. Federal labour is no better right now either. We live in tough times, incrementalism is not what people want to see. They want wholesale approaches. People think they are going to get that changing parties. Good luck with that.
19. I’m more getting at that it doesn’t matter who is in charge none of them will do a thing to benefit anyone but themselves
20. Which was massively set in motion by policy's pushed under Howard. And repeatedly hindered by cuts to things like Taff, which broke the pipeline of tradies that would reduce costs of construction and address a limiting factor in all state construction. We need people who can build shit. Government actions can take decades to really take effect, but its snowballed since then. Just like a lot of issues in the western world stems from the 80s when we fucked up our tax systems for rich people.
21. Bro, that's the dumbest take I've seen today. How does state LNP affect national tax? Why would Colesworths even bother lowering prices when they could just their buddies in the media to just skew the stats to suit the LNP?
22. It’ll effect public perception giving the news bs to report while they ignore the inadequacies of the lnp
23. Fooled me once, shame on you.... Fooled me twice....? Let's see what happens now. Are we going to see a Newman 2.0?
24. Well a fair amount of us in the health industry that aren't full time and contracted should be really worried right about now. The irony of all of the country people who contribute SFA tax wise,who are flown down at astronomical cost through RFDS etc fucking us is not lost on me
25. Fuck me dead. We are in for an absolute treat with this one.
26. I don’t know how anyone looks at the LNP and thinks, that’s the party that represents me and my values. The only thing I can think of is “ I have what’s mine and I don’t care” it’s apathy as long as it doesn’t affect me.
27. I'm just thankful that I was able to have an abortion 20 years ago. I fear for the women of today.
28. So another public service sector culling ? Followed by contract employment of government jobs by crappy recruitment agencies.
29. This election has actually enraged me I have never been this pissed off before about an election like this Queensland just let a slimy short greasy Italian version of Newman into power say good bye to the surplus we are in and the current plans for greener Queensland you may as well just send him your money now
30. honestly devastating as im going into uni for nursing and paramedicine after school next year
31. Given that entities with connections to Russian state apparatus have donated to Crisafulli's campaign, one with Putin instead of Newman is also applicable.
32. At least we know that Queenslanders will kick them out on their arse if they do it again.
33. I want my $1000 electricity royalty cash taken from the boomer aged pension to pay me seeing they wanted the coal companies to have it instead
34. Well the next four years are going to be tough. Just hope they get the venue for the Olympics right. Because the current plan of using Ballsac stadium will be an international embarrassment. Sure, give ball sac a coat of paint and a minor uplift, it’ll be a good venue for training before the event, but as the home of the athletics, it’s a terrible option.
35. I’m from Sydney. I can’t for the life of me, understand why Queensland voted this piece of shit in. Hopefully he sends a message to the rest of Australia, reminding them of the reasons not to vote for the LNP in the federal election.
36. Lol the insanity in these posts today. No wonder you lose elections if this is the mentality of the voter base
37. Crisafooli me once shame on you, Chrisafooli me twice shame on me.
38. If the LNP does make awful decisions would it be possible for the federal government to possibly force us into another election?
39. How is Reddit so jammed with Left wing loonies. The sweetest victory is seeing the greens get 0 seats and all the tears on reddit. Just amazing
40. You are mixing two shows together just like the Meme
41. As someone who supports labor, im surprised how we behave like Liberals when we lose. Accept defeat gracefully and focus on being a good opposition. Don’t let your personal beliefs, egos and opinions get in the way. Grow up.
42. Really see that labor voters taking the democratic election loss well.
43. Give him a chance. Most of you were in primary school when Newman was in. Stop following reddit and your your own brains
44. ALP shocked that repeating “Campbell Newman” like a stunned parrot for months didn’t distract from their miserable term in government.
45. Its all one One big scam anyhow. Fake jobs all of them. Unlucky if u work for state , grab that lawnmower and start mowing lawns.
46. The only thing I can be thankful for is not working in the public sector but this is definitely horrendous news.
47. They see Brisbanites having affordable public transport and think they deserve a six lane highway to their front door in bumfucknowhere
48. Preach, colleague. I work in a large Brisbane public hospital and this describes so many of the regional and rural patients (and their visiting families) that I meet on the wards. Really lovely people on a personal basis 90% of the time, charming to interact with, usually full of impressed praise at the level, quality and compassion of care they receive and awed at the medical resources that get deployed on their behalf - and so often with a bone deep hostility to Labor and a baffling paradoxical commitment to bringing in an LNP government that would at best severely neglect, and at worst badly gut, the very system that's helping them. So goddamn frustrating.
49. That is a perfectly valid point I had completely missed.
50. From working in polling, LNP voters are mostly old people who shout racist abuse to Asian polling staff, and immigrants who barely speak English who take their political advice from ACA.
51. That’s exactly what it is. People like my father who claim “I’m retired so I get free fares so 50c fares don’t affect me” $1000 energy rebate? He couldn’t even tell you his last 20 energy bills. They just get direct debited as he has more than enough money in retirement it doesn’t concern him. Same with the rego discount. “Free school lunches? Why would I vote for that that doesn’t affect me?”. He’s built a life for himself and been successful in the military and property investment and now he’s retired with more than enough money to last generations. None of the policies affect him. So he doesn’t care and just votes for who he’s always voted for. LNP
52. Or someone who served his country and now works on our family farm near Roma. The liberal party can get in the bin, but the nationals have always represented me and my values. It's easy to just throw hate, but you have no idea the absolute havoc this shit labor government has caused for myself and my family out here. You talk about apathy? How about some for us out west.
53. Contract employment through crappy recruitment agencies has been happening for years now. Nothing new
54. Punctuation? Come out west and see the shit that labor had caused. The bullshit beaucracy has caused havoc on our farm and many just like it. Fucking loved seeing Miles put on his ass tonight.
55. Fuck off city slickers of Brisbane. All might be nice and well in Brisbane but up North it’s a shit show. Let’s go LNP
56. And in 4 years, you might graduate under a different government. Don't let it get you down. Your career will withstand many changes in government.
57. As someone about to graduate from paramed stuck to nursing way easier to find work way more grads then jobs for paramedics and I don't expect QAS to be having massive hiring sprees soon
58. You’ll be fine. You don’t have to stay in QLD. You’ll be able to live and work anywhere.
59. You do the national registration after you finish paramedicine and can work in any state
60. Don’t postpone your life due to reddit Chicken Littles. The world will still be turning after your degree and you’ll be in a much better spot.
61. If its any consolation, i have just had a conversation with my current paramedicine mentor (on placement atm) about this exact thing. He started uni when libs were voted in last time and of course a bunch of jobs gor cut. By the time he graduated, labour was back in and rebuilding the healthcare workforce so there were plenty of jobs around.
62. If this is truly devastating, consider a different career for all our sakes.
63. Only if the new voting model of Cris isn't so FPTP that you are doomed.
64. That’s if he’s the next Newman. He might want to be the next Joh.
65. nope you are doomed. In fact by the time the decisions are made Dutton will probably be PM.
66. Not at all, the writing was on the wall ages ago. I was expecting something like 60-70 seat majority for the LNP.
67. Well you'll be taking the Public service cuts real well soon, don't you worry. your own stupidity will come back to bite you.
68. And he was 2 days away from selling Energex to Chinese investors if Newman got elected
69. I was voting age. I remember. In fact, I'll never forget what a shitshow it was. And I'll never forget the peak of all bumper stickers: "Can Do is a Can't".
70. I could add the N part of LNP and include old Joh if you want from lessons not learnt, but 100 days make that statement again.
71. The old Australian voter saying "give the other guy a go." Great way of viewing politics..
72. Maybe you were, how do you " your your own brains"?
73. Yeah. Public health was at breaking point a decade ago and now with rampant large family immigration and the inevitable lib cuts it's going to be so much worse. I hate how little wealthier lib fans with private health insurance care either. "Just don't be a nurse/doctor/etc". Yeah ok who's going to do it then mate. Sorry some of us care about other humans and aren't in finance or charging $200/hr as a tradie.
74. It's hard. The Bruce needs a massive overhaul up north. Neither the Libs or Labor are doing dick about it in the last 12 years. But hundreds of millions on infrastructure on top of the over a billion already sent to tourism operators in bailouts? bit of a tall ask I think to taxpayers.
75. This is literally the best way to describe so many rural voters. How the fuck do they expect 4-6 lane highways to literal towns of a few thousand. Browse facebook for an hour, so many of them are ego-y as fuck.
76. The Bruce Highway north of Gin Gin is straight up dangerous.
77. It's nuts. Like you got RFDS flown down for what should have been routine surgery in Bundy Base but now your in Brisbane. And it's Labors fault your local Katter/LNP/ON member for xyz years haven't spend billions expanding the hospitals up there.
78. Legitimately it's insane. They are all elderly, or unemployed and live on benefits, in deadbeat rust belt towns that died decades ago, and hold on to their glory days and watch sky news. They cost actual tax payers such insane money to keep going to, and the vote against the people that keep them alive.
79. Genuine question from someone in the suburbs who admittedly is often apathetic to people outside greater Brisbane (just being honest). What havoc?
80. I hate no hate, and just don’t understand how you vote for a party of no morals, no values, and has no plan for anything. When I see a party making great steps forward in renewable energy. Using royalties to get people back on public transport ( due to large interstate migration and roads full) and paying for free lunches for kids and energy bill rebates, I see that all as positives. I don’t understand how people see a negative in the ALP. They are trying to make the state better. Then the LNP just have zero plan except to make abortions illegal again and strip back royalties, which leads to reduced services.
81. You wont be loving it soon enough when LNP sucks us all dry like a leech looking for its next prey
82. What’s happened out west under labor that’s been so bad
83. Im from the Gold Coast but anyway. LNP voters got all excited about some buzz words an Italian greasy Man made but that man has already fallen back on his plans as he has nothing but the name he is an essay with a fancy title but blank pages miles long. LNP come in with some bright shiny neon lights and sucked Queenslanders up in them like Las Vegas on a Friday night
84. You're in for an absolute shocker when youth crime doesn't immediately dissipate, and your dwelling up north is still being neglected by the state.
85. LNP isn't going to do shit for you. They're going to reduce mining taxes and then who has to pay for that difference? ALL OF US. The LNP hasn't come into this election with any budget or even clear policies and the rural people ( who 100% Labor needs to do more to assist) don't think of the bigger picture.
86. doing the double at acu (hopefully), paramed the dream but will also have nursing as backup
87. He can’t install FPTP without calling a state referendum and imo he doesn’t have the balls for that
88. Dang. Would there be any possible way to overturn the government if we all wanted to?
89. yeah, overall Labor did a great job in this campaign to turn it around, very much hoping Miles stays on as Oppo leader and comes back again next election to take another shot
90. Oh yeah, everybody else’s fault Labor lost… the majority wanted the fuckwits out, just accept it
91. I was a nurse when Newman was in. Where you? Or see you following reddit rhetoric? Btw no nurses I knew lost their jobs
92. No nurses were sacked under newman you twit. I have a good friend that is a nurse and there isnt a nurse in the state that wants a job and cant find one. Newman never sacked anyone. They were redundancies and almost none of them from frontline staff. Australia has a disproportionate amount of people employed within the health industry relative to other OECD countries. Its not that we need less nurses, we need less bureaucracy and administrators.
93. Sorry that was my bad I’m having a few drinks in celebration 🥳
94. Somehow I actually doubt it. Feels like astroturfing rather than bots. So many accounts under 2 months old with negative karma
95. That's what pains me so much about people working in health or education or emergency services. Dismissive people just write them off "get a better paying job" or "just don't try to live in affluent areas if you can't afford it" and then suddenly there's no staff in these affluent areas. No nurses, no teachers, no police. Because why would they want to spend hours commuting because they can't afford to live near work? People want to help people and do a damn good job of it. At least pay them what they're worth!
96. And with the cut to mining royalties it’s def not going to happens.
97. >on top of the over a billion already sent to tourism operators in bailouts This storm season should be an interesting one for FNQ, let's see how LNP handle it...
98. How was Labor not doing dick about it? They literally spent $12 billion on the Bruce Highway Upgrade Program since 2013 and had just committed to increasing their funding yet again. As of this year the program has delivered: - 120 new bridges - 66 new and upgraded rest areas - 489km roadside safety barriers - 72 township entry treatments - 247km wide centre line treatments - 100 new overtaking lanes - 204 protected right-hand turns - 73km of highway duplication - 8 flood immunity upgrade projects completed How is that “not doing dick”?
99. Those mega-wide highways often bypass the little towns, which in itself wipes them out further…
100. Like, theres a few pot holes but people make it sound like the kokoda track. I've done the whole length twice this year, its fine.
101. Maybe the speed limit should be adjusted to make it safe for the conditions.
102. You have never been out of the city have you
103. I live in "one of those rust belt towns" that provides the food SEQ eats every day. Our local economy contributes 100's of millions every year to QLD's economy. I'm also a long term public hospital worker. Since Covid we've been inundated with thousands of people moving from Sunshine Coast, Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. House prices have doubled. But the Labor govt didn't fund out HHS, dragged it's feet doing anything and put in an incompetent Board to manage the service. We prefer to be treated locally, but the methodology is to fly people to Brisbane. So blame the government, don't blame the people here. Oh, and btw, 5.4% swing to the LNP in the Brisbane local government area. So it's not all regional QLD. Edit: Peak Reddit. Down votes despite facts.
104. Specifically to my issues? Changes in the export rules mid season, so we don't know what our livestock will be valued at. Water regulation and drought assistance. Constant changes and cuts have happened. It's an awful stress.
105. Adding on, not pertinent to me, but allowing overseas conglomerates to overtake and undercut the dairy industry. Look, I'm not saying that what will work for me will work for inner Brisbane. But you can't just pretend we don't exist or marginalise our contribution. Labor have always been a disgrace to the agricultural sector at a state and federal level.
106. All the issues you listed don't really matter here. Belittling who I vote for also isn't a good way to try and express your point. Labor won't ever win out here, so maybe that's why they ignore us, who knows. But you asked why I have my views. Simply sweeping all LNP under the rug and saying no values isn't a fair shake either. If only we could go back to NP.
107. Then you can appreciate what it's been like out west. I'm already there buddy.
108. I think you mean the fuckwits wanted them out. Had it the other way around
109. Yes its everyone fault they voted in a incompetent newman era politician.
110. I was sacked - sorry, *made redundant* - by CN. Frontline mental health.
111.
