Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. You are correct in your statements. Looking at the directional trends will add additional insight. Look at what happens to the unemployment rate just before a recession. And The number of people unemployed for over 27 weeks is increasing in the same manner it has in all prior recessions: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UEMP27OV 27 weeks is significant as it’s the time period of when unemployment runs out.
2. Not to mention the so called "Land of the Free" has also used conscription before, including in wars where the security of the US itself was not at threat, like in Vietnam.
3. Which part … you said we are getting invaded I’m telling you we are not.
4. Our best line of defense is our coast line dude… you don’t think the RAF wouldn’t take out the boats with thousands of troops on it or shoot down the incoming jets with paratroopers ??
5. In my head if I get pulled up if I tried to tap SOMETHING I have a card to play
6. It most certainly is...and I've said that for years. Ruffled the religious zealots feathers on many an occasion. It's the Conservative way...they hate people who progress , especially career women. They want to be pregnant and controlled so they don't show their lack of intelligence.
7. You’re stereotyping again. I suggest following The Bulwark to expand your horizons. Tim Miller is an ex-Republican campaign manager for presidential candidates. He’s married to a man. Has a child. He supports the rights of undocumented immigrants. He hates MAGA. Sarah Longwell is a Republican. She is married to a women. She has a child. She did a town hall with Harris. She hates MAGA.
8. I’ve not said anything. You said inflation is due to wars. We’ve had rampant inflation here yet we’re not at war. Hence the contradiction.
9. You clearly don’t understand how small our Airforce and Navy is without US support🤣
10. Cool. Two people with some level of basic common sense, hooray. You’re not getting it. Not being a Trumper is the sociopolitical equivalent of not sticking forks up your nose as dinner etiquette. It means they’re not a total blathering moron. It doesn’t make a person *smart* or *decent*. You can be six kinds of idiot and/or asshole without being a Trumper at the same time. I don’t *like* conservatives, I don’t respect them, and I don’t agree with their “philosophy” that amounts to nothing more than advantaging their in-group and disadvantaging the out-group for no reason whatsoever beyond “I wanna”. I don’t believe at this late stage that they’ve come up with anything more novel and insightful than that. If they’re conservatives but not Trumpers, goody-gum-drops. Hooray. *I am not obligated to take the rest of their crap seriously.*
11. Maga...extra horrible... Conservatives....the START of MAGA. MAGA didn't pop up out of nowhere...they are Conservatives. There were many disgraceful Conservatives before Trump and MAGA. All deplorable human beings. Mitch McConnel, considered 'a conservative' now but only because he doesn't quite want to lynch minorities on the street.
12. The inflation is happening because of energy security. Australia does not refine its own oil. Russia is a huge exporter of oil which the democrats are trying to defeat with sanctions
13. Yeah it’s not huge but the alliance is an unbreakable bond.. You clearly don’t understand how wars are fought in the 21st century - but that’s ok. Agree to disagree and let’s move on
14. I applaud your comment. So true... Conservatives ...the ass end of morality...
15. Sad you have so much hate that you feel the need to stereotype a huge segment of the population and assume you know each of their “philosophy” based purely on a preconceived image of them. I hope we as a society can get past this extreme tribalism both sides are developing.
16. Of course there were horrible conservatives before MAGA like the Tea Partiers wanting to take away Obama Care. But you again, many doesn’t equal all.
17. > the alliance is an unbreakable bond I’m sure Ukraine thought the same too. But it still comes down to you don’t care about how bad Trump’s Ukraine policy is simply because you don’t think it can happen to us. Real conservatives want to protect democracies around the world.
18. I do too. To do so, we would need to get rid of conservatism. Conservatism plus time and power equals fascism. People fascists hate: Academics, Anarchists, Blacks, Communists, Disabled, Ethnic Minorities, Feminists, Homosexuals, Intellectuals (that’s me!), Jews, Muslims, Socialists (ooh I’m in there too!), Transgender, Union Members. People antifascists hate: Fascists.
19. Preconceived ? The PROVE every point by themselves. There is no preconception. Believe them when they clearly show what they are.
20. Actually it does include all if they don't step away from voting "Party above Policy" , which is a Conservative law. Oh, I don't like Hitler but I will vote for his party.....get it ?
21. If you’re so blinded that you think all conservatives == fascists then there’s really no point continuing this discussion. Have a good one.
22. Again with the stereotyping. You know there was a time when progressives were against stereotyping.
23. You didn’t even read my comment. You just *assumed* that was what I said. I said, conservatism turns into fascism given enough time and enough power to accumulate. Which is historically how it has always gone. Do all conservatives go along with it? Of course not. *But most do.* Because ultimately conservatism is nothing more than “the law should protect but not bind me and mine, and bind but not protect others”.
24. Do you not understand what I wrote ? "Believe them when they clearly show what they are....."
25. Who is against higher coal royalties? More taxes for them means more services for us! (or lower personal taxes, both good)
26. It's that 20% or so that say 'no difference' that's the killer
27. Interesting that 59% of KAP voters support funding for abortion services and pregnancy termination care.
28. What's the link to where you got these, pretty hard to read.
29. These read well. Though there's nothing about crime, nor the credit rating consequence of paying for these. People now just want a change of government.
30. It's why LNP has gotten over 4 million in donations to slander the labour party. They have been promised tax breaks which will equal more debt for qld
31. It's not free money, it's *our* money. It's taking *our* cut of *our* resources and giving it back to society. It's taking the cream off the top of the insane profits of mining companies and feeding the kid who's Mum didn't have enough to buy lunches that week, or cutting public transport costs so Grandma can afford to go to her appointments *and* eat a healthy diet for her heart issues. But by all means QLD, go ahead and vote back in a Government which has proven time and time again that they don't care about that. They don't care about you unless something is in it for them.
32. Qld isn't in debt.... Without the mining royalties, there will be debt in the future.
33. Are we not already seeing it in Queensland with the policies that have already been rolled in by Labor being funded by coal royalties?
34. Yup, it’s literally why these COL measures and consequently Miles’ popularity have surged. In 2012 Campbell Newman immediately implemented a ten year moratorium on coal royalties. In 2022 it expired, and the Labor state government reformed the tax legislation to increase coal royalties leading to over $15 Billion in revenue directly funding COL measures. The pragmatic effect on individuals day to day living is likely why the attack ads by the QLD Resources Council haven’t worked.
35. The coal money is already gone - the prices have fallen & we won’t get $22b or whatever it was when they went crazy…the issue is if we bake in spending that amount all the time we’ll end up being screwed. It’s like getting a massive bonus one year & assuming it’ll happen every year.
36. Oh no are the coal companies going to be sad and go away? Sounds awful, I can't wait for my children to breathe clean air about it.
37. Spending coal royalties on COL measures is investing in ourselves and will increase overall productivity long-term. More so, it’s been our years of strategic investment into Renewable projects which will yield ongoing revenue and job creation long-term. There will always be growing pains with fluctuating prices in coal, delayed Renewable projects, red tape etc., but the ALP’s strategy is sound. The LNP’s strategy of less taxation on coal, extending coal-fired power stations, and Nuclear fantasy is not sound.
38. I don’t think you understand the comment. QLD has always had coal royalties, what happened more recently was the government increased the % royalty over certain price thresholds which due to the surging price of coal brought a massive windfall to QLD. The current market price of coal has significantly declined as such the royalty they pay has significantly dropped I.e. the government won’t get $22b or whatever this year….its got nothing to do with politics, its simply the market price of coal driving the outcome… The issue is if the government assumes the windfall will continue every year (based on a once in a generation coal price), they’ll over commit on spending & create a significant deficit.
39. To be clear I’m not advocating coal companies paying less royalties - I’m simply saying based on the existing royalty framework they pay based on market prices. The market price has fallen significantly, as such the amount they pay QLD has fallen. If the government spends it like they’re going to receive the record amount every year, they’ll overspend as the revenue will drop off. That’s the reason they’re doing mostly one off stuff like bill credits etc, but if they make it recurring we’ll likely see issues in the future.
40. Yes, if we go back to historical prices for coal, which seems likely, royalties will be the same as of 2012. So really we should probably switch to a sliding scale |**Price per Tonne**|**Before 2012**|**2012 - 2022**|**Post-2022**| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Up to **A$100**|7%|7%|7%| |**A$100.01 - A$150**|10%|12.5%|12.5%| |**Above A$150**|12.5%|15%|15%| |**Above A$175**|\-|\-|20%| |**Above A$225**|\-|\-|30%| |**Above A$300**|\-|\-|40%| # Summary: 1. **Before 2012**: The rates topped out at **12.5%** for coal priced above A$150 per tonne. 2. **2012 Adjustments**: Increased the top rate to **15%** for coal above A$150 per tonne. 3. **2022 Changes**: Introduced three additional tiers for prices above **A$175**, **A$225**, and **A$300**, with the highest rate at **40%**.
41. For sure, but the one off COL measures like $1000 electricity rebates, $200 Fair Play sporting vouchers for kids, 20% discount on car rego etc. are paid by the coal royalties windfall. So it’s not baked in. The 50c PT and free school lunches etc. are going into the debt. That’s a different debate on long-term investment in ourselves v increasing debt.
42. Thanks for taking the time to post the actual info.
43. No worries, when I initally read your comments I instinctly disagreed, though then I thought to myself, wait I myself don't actually understand the differences over time in the tax, I should research them. And yeah, mate you are correct, so it's kinda shitty people downvoting you :(
44. All good - facts & anonymous internet posts don’t always go together…ha
45. Yep pretty much and once you get to negative 3 or 4 people will just downvote you without even reading what you’ve said most of the time, oh well such is life.
46. $8m rent per year in today's $? The yield should be reasonably low, considering the risk... 7 - 9 % per annum at most? At 8%, this would value the building at approx $100m?? Lol. That can't be right?? This all looks very, very fishy indeed. I wonder who is involved in the deal, on both sides?
47. Something weird going on with this tenancy... who owns the building and who do they know in the QPS?
48. The landlord paid $45m for that site just over 3 years ago. They will be laughing!!! This site is a dogs breakfast, I can’t believe they’ve locked themselves in on this deal to be honest.
49. "the contract was signed before a funding source was identified". Huh? Maybe Police works differently but in other government agencies and departments it is illegal to go to market, much less sign a contract, unless the budget is locked and loaded. It should never have been signed off and whoever signed it is fucked... Well, maybe not fucked but in trouble. Well, not much trouble, just a stern talking to. Probably not that stern. Actually, never mind, it's probably their wife's commercial property and everything is hunky dory tickety boo... Win win, good for the tax payer.
50. That’s precisely the level of competency Ive encountered in the public sector
51. I'm still very confused about this deal. Who signed off on it? And - who benefits? On the face of it, surely it would make more sense for the govt to buy land and build at a new site? Yet they are going to pay up to $240m in rent over the next 20+ years.....???
52. Which commissioned Officer is close or related to the building owner?
53. Something the article also misses is govt departments use accrual not cash accounting, so it’s not a $100 million hole this year, it’s a $100 million divided by 15 hole per year for 15 years.
54. The fact the CCC is looking into it suggests there is something fishy going on, perhaps with the owner of the property and links to the QPS?
55. Well they were up 200M revenue from infringements last financial year, so looks like we’re getting more fine increases boys and girls to cover this fuckup. $500 fine for 4km/h over the speed limit anyone?
56. I was actually angry when I saw this on the news. Like literally really pee’d off about it. Surely those numbers are wrong, cannot be right. Stones corner $8m a year rent, has to be a joke? Does the site belong to a politician? My bloods boiling thinking about this, I’ve never pulled the “my tax money” etc but this story is absolutely hit a nerve, I’m super super pee’d that they’d spend this kinda dough on rent. Common, no one with half a brain would pay that much for that little in return. What a joke…
57. Convenient timing this dropping when it did, right before media blackout too
58. Are people suprised that bosses in the QPS make shit contract deals?
59. I wonder if my local state member of parliament signed off on this
60. Kind of crazy the hoops of documentation and approvals people need to go through for meager amounts when getting loans or applying for rentals while someone just signs away $116 million without anyone knowing.
61. Why doest the government own buildings to support government services
62. How about the gutter. That are not heroes, they ruin lives and destroy families. Why should anyone even want to care. So mote it be
63. Find savings?? They mean find more efficient ways to fine us and pay for the kient that way lol
64. Sounds like a good thing for criminals, even more effort will probably get diverted into handing out fines.
65. Surely they should be purchasing the building for that kind of money. Why didn’t they just rebuild on the existing police building in stones corner.
66. As a valuer I can assure you that is complete baloney. 65 mill max at 8% not accounting for other detriment factors to value. It’s more like 5.2mil a year or 80-90 mil after 15 years accounting for reviews.
67. I can see the cost being that fairly easily. It's got to be a pretty big building as it is going to contain all the officers from Coorparoo, Annerley, & Dutton Park stations as well as multiple smaller units. It's going to house several hundred officers, all their vehicles, specialist units and will also have lockup facilities. So you're going to be looking at an expensive and large building. It's also going to be on logan road itself as well which will make it more expensive. For a comparison the block of land the super cheap auto is on there sold for $8m back in 2016
68. I, for one, am shocked that this has happened and tarnished the reputation of such a fine and upstanding organisation.
69. Exactly, this has happened before, need to dig deeper on this one and connect the dots
70. There you go. Follow the money? Who paid for it, and why.
71. Used to work in that building, it would leak every time it rained
72. I have heard rumours that they have the *money* to pay for it but they did not have permission to enter into borrowings and agency borrowing needs to be approved separately. A lease is a type of borrowing for in accounting.
73. Would the contract even be valid? You surely can’t sign on behalf of an organisation without following its rules. Surely this will be litigated
74. The QLD State Government gets the fine money, not QPS.
75. The state government sets the infringement amounts, and the state government gets the money... and Labor has been quietly sneaking them up for decades. Right under your nose..
76. Lol my mate works for their department. I also work in public service but my department has little revenue, like most departments. He reckons his office is swimming in random lazy workers because of their income.
77. Unless you live in the Morayfield district, unlikely they had anything to do with it.
78. I'd heard rumours of them taking over the Griffith University Mt Gravatt campus, that would have been a heck of a lot more logical and cheaper than this
79. Where are you getting those figures from? I'm going with 1) the rent per year in that article, and 2) an estimate of yield between 7 and 9% ... For me, that's 8%. Your figures are very different, but you haven't provided any clear reason as to why.
80. 8% for a 15 year lease to QPS in stones corner sounds a bit soft don’t you think? 555 corro sold ~8.50% and that has flood risk and much shorter WALE. I think SRG House is being priced at ~8% in the market and that’s in strathpine with development land.
81. There is nothing in Stones Corner like that. I wonder where they mean? Or your summation of the set up won’t be close.
82. It's also a legislative requirement that all fines from cameras need to go into road safety initiatives or rehabilitation for those injured in traffic crashes.
83. The left hand puts money in, the right hand takes money out.
84. And it's revenue so it does not factor in the costs, which leave the final figure in the sfa vicinity. But hey 'revenue raising' gets clicks and that is the only thing the media care about.
85. QPS Commish - “I am the QLD State Government”. Probably.
86. >quietly sneaking them up Don't think there's been too much quiet about it. Fine increases have been widely publicised.
87. The figures in the article are wrong. I’ve seen this lease and unless they are paying another 3 mil in rent for car parking (which they aren’t), these figures are wrong. For context, the actual rent is $725/m2 over 7,266m2 if I remember correctly and is reviewed annually.
88. Wouldn’t be 8% just hypothetical, but can see it in the 7’s first sure but 8%+ in the burbs is where it’s gonna plateau now I think.
89. There’s some corporate offices just on the corner where Logan Road goes left, and the main road becomes Montague Road to go north to Old Cleveland Road. Big car park behind it that you access off Cleveland St. I was moving stuff out of there for a customer months ago.
90. I'm going to guess that it is going to be a new build / purpose built. Which is going to add to the cost. Here are previous stories about this Talking about the station mergers - [https://annerleynews.com.au/major-shake-up-as-annerley-dutton-park-police-to-merge-with-new-stones-corner-facility/](https://annerleynews.com.au/major-shake-up-as-annerley-dutton-park-police-to-merge-with-new-stones-corner-facility/) and sorry for the FB link, but it's a scan from the an old newspaper article talking about the location [https://scontent.fbne11-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/402888514\_1114350843271587\_1484928849083725020\_n.jpg?\_nc\_cat=102&ccb=1-7&\_nc\_sid=bd9a62&\_nc\_ohc=R1tXODf2zLoQ7kNvgG3gUR8&\_nc\_ht=scontent.fbne11-1.fna&\_nc\_gid=AbHs6T89QrwKaJTkOVDZVZh&oh=00\_AYBIZjhd-73qojQZKYKIOe9KGprPGEAOXTJEtaspBi8Y5g&oe=671EAB6D](https://scontent.fbne11-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/402888514_1114350843271587_1484928849083725020_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=bd9a62&_nc_ohc=R1tXODf2zLoQ7kNvgG3gUR8&_nc_ht=scontent.fbne11-1.fna&_nc_gid=AbHs6T89QrwKaJTkOVDZVZh&oh=00_AYBIZjhd-73qojQZKYKIOe9KGprPGEAOXTJEtaspBi8Y5g&oe=671EAB6D)
91. Surely they'll realise that revenue increases on camera fines means they're not changing behaviours. Needs to be some sort of feedback to drivers to change behaviour in the moment.
92. So more cameras then. "speed camera ahead - for road safety" signs make a bit more sense now. It's justification for the spend ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
93. Channel 9 not getting figures right to bash the govt? :o
94. If that is the correct starting rental figure, it only takes (a journo or anyone else with a calculator) punching in $5.2 * (1.035^23) to quickly get to $116m… it fails to take into account the time value of money or government stumping up the cash now ($70? $80m?) to go and build a semi-purpose built office facility themselves. NPV of that 23 year cash flow is $80.46m at 7% discount rate. Capitalising the starting rent at 6.5% cap rate gets you to $81m. Developer is already in for $45m for a leased office investment - another $3,000-$4,000/m2 (?) fit-out for police (maybe there’s a portion that’s incentive or rent free) and I can see it making sense, though it does seem like an economic rent without any other info. Depends on what their original “budget” was. Would be an interesting one to model completely.
95. Plus have to take off incentives from that 725 of say 35-45%.
96. Ok thanks. I know where you mean. It’s not ideal though.
97. It is. All of the previous tenants had vacated by June this year to make way for QPS.
98. >Queensland Police has signed a lease for $116 million over 15 years to take over the building Meanwhile.... >I'm going to guess that it is going to be a new build / purpose built ???
99. I agree. There is no shortage of offending behaviour that would be detected by simply putting more police on the road, with the benefit that pulling someone over shortly after the offence has a greater effect on prevention than getting a fine a month later in the mail.
100. They have changed behaviours. They say it in the current budget. Fines revenue actually dropped last financial year so they're getting more cameras to get revenue back up. https://preview.redd.it/1oigb0bi2nwd1.jpeg?width=2235&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a54dd3a4f9d2afbc4bc23d57b597c68c9377c1e5
101. 15%. Will also have to consider the fioout costs too!
102. What a terrible deal. Prime suburban stock was around mid 600 with 40/45% incentive. $725 almost net is more than most tenants paying in A-grade CBD stock
103. Sounds more like they want the government/taxpayers to invest in it.
104. The Bakries won’t even fund a reasonable squad, why would they fund a stadium. They’re notoriously bad investors.
105. No one talks about the fact it already has a tenant - Brisbane Strikers? Who also released (admittedly delusional) plans to redevelop the grounds themselves? And FQ have also released an AI sketch of a wildly optimistic proposal as well? Until the three parties sort out who is running the show then no one is building anything. Oh and while I’m on a rant, Roar has a long track record of not paying their bills. Why would the Qld Govt sign up for that? When the Roar folds and the Bakries fuck right off then maybe we should do it for the next, proper, owners.
106. I’m a massive A-league fan, but I’m quite sure the owners of the Roar themselves are the biggest stumbling block when it comes to investing in a stadium. Secondly, I don’t blame state government for not necessarily trusting the Roar in this situation when they’ve been unable to pay their players during two separate seasons. I’m not a roar supporter as I grew up elsewhere and already had a team, but if they want articles like this to not come off as victimisation, they should continue to work towards repairing their reputation with fans, which includes RESULTS on the field. You’ve still got some work to do Kaz and Zac, no one’s trusting your bosses just yet. Like I said, grow a competitive team again and you might get away with this article.
107. Roar are allowed to invest, they just don’t have the money to pay for it..
108. lol the roar owners pulling off a bait and switch "publicly fund stadium or we leave"
109. Would they ever consider going back to being Queensland Roar at all? Country Bank stadium in Townsville and Cbus Super Stadium at Robina seem like the size they are looking for, and limited games at all three venues may draw bigger crowds overall.
110. Our local club who is incredibly affluent and attracts high level funding every election, is a disgrace with the president overtly party aligned to LNP. This president has promoted the promises of only one candidate and sent multiple political messages out to all members and followers. Football association needs to pull their head in. I love football, but man the association and clubs are wack.
111. Unfortunately it’s not the late 2000’s & no one cares about the roar like they used to.
112. Make them play at the Scaffolding Stadium in Nathan. How long could it take to throw it up? May as well get a bit of use out of it before they rip it back down in 2033.
