Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. I like how I explain why they aren't and you just... Ignore it and re-iterate. Passive investing is the practice of investing ETFs. ETFs are investments in many companies to form a fund that the public can invest in. ETFs are not a gamble, unless a large number of the largest companies in the world collapse. If that happens, we have bigger problems than an investment portfolio. All you're telling me is that you aren't knowledgeable enough about investing to be talking about it. If you're not an idiot, your money is in a bank that is covered under the $250k government guarantee. If a bank fails, you will get your money back, provided you are not, as aforementioned, an idiot. Have more than 250k? Use another bank. Quite honestly though, the government won't allow a bank to collapse. I imagine it would cost them a lot less money to save a bank than it would to reimburse potential millions of Australians. Why are you even talking about investments? I feel like you think it was some form of addition to your initial statement, but it just kind of resulted in you being shown up, so I'm not sure what your goal was?
2. Enjoy that old hag ig I hope you like maggots cos ur cookie is 6ft under
3. Well it’s not a fucking horse now is it? Of course it is human if it is inside another human. It just doesn’t have human rights therefore it’s not murder to terminate.
4. Do you think anyone will ever care about your books?
5. Born alive doesn’t mean born not viable, and to present it other wise is an outright lie
6. You keep talking about 20 weeks. I'm asking about all pregnancies. It's horrific to kill a healthy baby, don't you think?
7. '"If" a mother decides that they are not fit to be a mother, for many reasons, and the pregnancy wasn't planned, they may decide it is better to end the pregnancy.' This is the only relevant paragraph. If someone feels unfit to look after their own children, that is a serious problem. If they then think the solution is to kill their own children, it is an even more serious problem. Defending the autonomy and liberty of infanticidal parents is beyond bizarre. We don't do it with paedophiles. No-one is out here claiming they have "bodily autonomy" to hurt children. So why do it for the parents, those who should be the most protective of their children? Infanticidal people have no place in a sane world.
8. The cells are a baby and the incubators are mothers. Funny how you want to dehumanize the baby by callling it mere cells but want to humanize the mother by not calling her an incubator. Cells in an incubator or a baby in a mother. It's one or the other, be consistent.
9. Good grief. Pregnancy does not cost women one of their kidneys and half their liver. I've heard a lot of terrible and desperate pro-abortion arguments, but that is actually the most absurd. Congratulations.
10. The discussion is healthy babies conceived consensually. If you are fine with killing such babies, you don't need any excuses like medical issues or rape pregnancies.
11. No, pro-choice is about killing babies and cloaking that horror behind notions of personal freedom and liberty.
12. My point is that those statistics do not separate out babies born alive that have conditions that are not compatible with life - you asked whether I would support a bill that made a provision for that and I would, but there is no evidence that babies who would otherwise survive are being born breathing and left to die. Even in the document you linked it says: There are almost always severe circumstances leading to a small number of women who choose to terminate a pregnancy after 20 weeks gestation. Which implies there are few, if any, healthy pregnancies being terminated after 20 weeks. There is zero evidence that this is happening. I would also say that if you look up the current clinical guidelines for babies showing signs of life following a termination, they are reasonable and sensible. They include discussion with the parents beforehand what they would like to happen, ie should they perform intervention or not. Introducing a bill as suggested would mean doctors have no choice. Also it means that doctors may simply refuse to perform the termination for fear of what might happen, leaving the woman to carry an unviable pregnancy to term which would cause serious mental harm.
13. You realise its a crime to buy any restricted medication online without a prescription... right.... And even if you have a prescription, you need to inform border force of your import. As for :people can't afford it, well people sometimes steal things because they cannot afford them, the laws still apply. If they dont pay for the costs of their elective treatment, someone else has to... I will also add that you had a single example from 2010, 14 years ago... doesnt seem like its a common conviction.
14. I’m not an LNP voter… in fact I didn’t vote at all. 🤣🤣🤣. I’m just a bystander in this state watching the meltdown on these subs today by people who got absolutely sucked in by the scare tactics created by each other. Which culminated into today’s Chernobyl. It was even funnier them trying to defend themselves. It will be just as when Boomers keep thinking Dutton is doing a great job, he wins election and Aus goes through 3 PMs in the space of 12-18 months again.
15. Yikes. “Unless a large number of the world’s largest companies collapse”: so you admit there is risk of that, no matter how small. You reckon if the Chinese invaded and our banking system collapsed, they’d be like oh yeah, nah, we will pay it all back to you. Again, minute risk, still there. You brought up you don’t buy product on what it could be in the future. You open up that term deposit, it says in 12 months you’ll get 4% more… there is still a risk you lose it all. And you know I have a point here. I’m literally talking about the safest thing you can possibly do to. Everything we buy, we buy in the premise of what it could be in the future or out of pure necessity.
16. Did her job that she didn’t lose not require her to be alive?Is she a Labor minister?
17. So a foetus doesn't deserve human rights even though it is human?
18. if you think that is what they will stop at doing, you need your head read.
19. This is just galactic levels of bullshit. The only way to get a late term abortion is if the fetus has abnormalities not compatible with life. You think these ladies are waking up one morning, 30 weeks pregnant and deciding, actually no, I don't want this, and getting abortions? Cause it does not work like that.
20. Technically, no. But the law is never good at legislating these things because medicine is complex. Do you provide life-prolonging care to a baby that will only ever survive on life support? Is that really morally okay, to prolong a life full of pain and suffering? Technically, the law would require you to because it is 'life saving' treatment. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. Do you put a neonate on dialysis even though it won't survive long even with the treatment? Isn't it better to provide supportive care, comfort, relief and a safe place for the parents to spend a short time with their baby? Leave this to the well-establish medical practice guidelines that already account for this. No need to legislate medical procedures that are already medically and ethically sound, and if there is a question about the ethics, the decision is referred to the courts anyway so no need to legislate it with meaningless shite.
21. almost like i’m talking directly about a bill you responded to about 20+wk abortions🤯. I don’t think abortions, especially before 10weeks are killing babies at all. do you think fertilised eggs at fertility clinics are babies? do you think fertilised chicken eggs are chickens? I’m not against abortions because i know the research and the research says outlawing abortions doesn’t stop abortions it stops safe abortions and criminalises miscarriages, and non-viable births. i’m not against abortions because it is a woman’s right to choose when, where, and who with she wants to have a baby with. i’m not against abortions because i know forcing women to raise children(sometimes children born from rape)they don’t want is a nightmare reality and not one i want to live in. i’ve made my stance very clear, on early and late stage abortions for both medical and personal reasons, im not sure what else you want me to say quite honestly.
22. See this right here shows the misogyny inherent to all pro-forced-birth arguments- you are equating a tiny, non-sentient blob of cells to a living breathing adult human woman. And referring to pregnant women as 'incubators' unironically is pretty fucking disgusting!
23. No it doesn't, generally. But it forces them to grow a placenta and use that, as well as the rest of their body to keep someone else alive. Although kidney and liver failure are both known complications of pregnancy. So I used what is known as a metaphor to draw a comparison to the fact that there is no other situation where a person can be mandated by law to donate their body to someone else to keep it alive. Because God knows you don't understand empathy.
24. The point and you have been totally missed just recognise that maybe women should be able to do as they need to do whether that means they abort or not ffs and conservatives should stay the fuck out of women’s uteruses!
25. > Yikes. Ignoring what I said again. > "Unless a large number of the world's largest companies collapse": so you admit there is risk of that, no matter how small. There is a point where the risk is so unbelievably, incredibly small, that it's not even worth considering. Where we get to the point where if it did happen, we'd have much bigger problems. That's one of them. > You reckon if the Chinese invaded Here we go. > and our banking system collapsed, they'd be like oh yeah, nah, we will pay it all back to you. I mean, first off, that's not the Australian government anymore. If you're invaded by a foreign power, shockingly, they aren't going to resume business as usual. I don't know why you think this is a valid point. > Again, minute risk, still there. Minute risk of you getting shot the moment you step outside every day, too. Do you still go outside? Mhm. > You brought up you don't buy product on what it could be in the future. Yup. > You open up that term deposit, it says in 12 months you'll get 4% more... Shitty rate, but yup. > There is still a risk you lose it all. If the bank collapsed. See previous comment. > And you know I have a point here. You... Tell yourself that... > I'm literally talking about the safest thing you can possibly do to. What? > Everything we buy, we buy in the premise of what it could be in the future No. > or out of pure necessity. Sometimes, obviously. I... Don't understand what your point is. It's muddled words trying to make a point. It doesn't make sense, it's not logical.
26. She’s not dead. Just to me. I’m gonna go abort my 12 month pregnancy now
27. Lmao you're pathetic.Go to school buddy, learn a thing or two.
28. >I don’t think abortions, especially before 10weeks are killing babies at all. "Killing babies is fine because it isn't killing babies." >I’m not against abortions because i know the research and the research says outlawing abortions doesn’t stop abortions it stops safe abortions "Bad things should be legal because people will do them anyway. Research shows people rape and murder regardless, so let's make it legal and safe to do so." >i’m not against abortions because it is a woman’s right to choose when, where, and who with she wants to have a baby with. "I'm not against women killing their babies because they can choose to get pregnant". >i’m not against abortions because i know forcing women to raise children(sometimes children born from rape)they don’t want is a nightmare reality "Killing babies is fine for people who want to kill their babies. Also sometimes pregnancy is the result of rape but I don't care about that because I think consensual pregnancies can also be killed."
29. >misogyny No. There is nothing hateful about not wanting babies to be killed. There is everything hateful about wanting babies to be killed. It's not about the sex of the babies either, both male and female babies are precious. >pro-forced-birth No, we're talking about consensually conceived healthy babies, not rape pregnancies. >you are equating a tiny, non-sentient blob of cells to a living breathing adult human woman. No, you are equating a baby with a tiny, non-sentient blob of cells, like a mole to be removed. I am being honest. Women are not incubators and babies are not clumps of cells. Stop hiding behind dehumanising medical language.
30. I do understand empathy, that is why I am viscerally horrified by the deaths of healthy babies conceived consensually. It's also why I despise the arguments that try to justify such a nightmarish act. Your metaphor was simply a lie. We are talking about healthy pregnancies, not ones where either the baby or the mother are at risk. No good sane person thinks it is possible to kill such babies.
31. Someone doesn’t like being proven wrong…. Hahahahahahhaha. Good luck out there Big Fella. Let’s hope those risks of yours don’t end up biting you in the ass, wouldn’t want to be buying something in the premise that it only may come into fruition now would we.
32. Someone doesn’t like being proven wrong…. Hahahahahahhaha. Good luck out there Big Fella. Let’s hope those risks of yours don’t end up biting you in the ass, wouldn’t want to be buying something in the premise that it only may come into fruition now would we.
33. Oh another made up lie , do you want to have a rally for dead mothers now? See you’re in a battle of wits completely unarmed. I am pro abortion and in your case I think it should be compulsory
34. we will never agree because we fundamentally disagree on the concept of conception. we will never agree because i will ALWAYS prioritise the women giving birth over the possibility of a child, you don’t seem to even consider the mother at all. you compare having an abortion it to murder and rape without the consideration of what pregnancy does to a woman’s body and soul, and you don’t care that illegal abortions out of desperation frequently kill the women attempting them because you don’t care about life, you care about forcing women to be incubators. outlawing abortions for personal reasons over medical reasons makes them harder for people who medically need them, which you seem to care about but not actually because all the research suggests any abortion bans make medically necessary abortions significantly harder to access. you care about the potential life but not actually because i have seen very little protest from the pro-forced birth community to increase community services to help new mothers and to fix the foster system. With domestic violence on the rise in australia with little being done about it by our government, one of the worst things i can imagine is banning abortions and forcing more children to grow up in violent and broken households. nothing you say, no pathetic attempts at poking holes in my beliefs will get me to change my stance on this.
35. Mate, thankyou, for so been openly honest how you view abortions, because your real window into area alot of us don't understand, be a sexist prick who only view women in the window of making babies. Cheers
36. Good thing there's no baby to kill in any of those examples then :)
37. Are you playing dumb on purpose, or are you actually just this stupid? You're a misogynist for wanting to take the right to reproductive healthcare away from women. Literally nothing to do with the sex of the babies?? 'Forced birth' refers to forcing pregnant women to carry a foetus, that they want to abort, to term. Whether or not the conception was consensual is completely irrelevant to that discussion, keep up No fully grown babies are being aborted, when will you people stop spreading this obvious lie? Late term abortions only make up a tiny fraction of terminations (literally 1-2%) and are only done when the foetus is incompatible with life or the mother's life is at immediate risk. These abortions are almost always on wanted pregnancies- no one is suffering through 5+ months of pregnancy just to change their mind and get an abortion on a whim. Over 90% of terminations are done before 14 weeks and at that point, the foetus is closer to a mole than a fully grown baby lol. Have you ever seen a foetus at that stage? Not to be crude, but it's literally a blob with vague limb and head shapes that is indistinguishable from animal foetuses at similar stages. If you think that's equivalent to a live newborn baby, you need to get your eyes checked because they're completely different. I know which one you'd save from a burning building if you were forced to choose, and it wouldn't be the foetus.
38. The mothers life is always at risk with pregnancy, though. That's the point. Pregnancy is dangerous, even when it goes well. Me? I had a textbook healthy pregnancy. And then in labor, my daughter got stuck on my pelvis and had to be manually pulled out of my body by a doctor, causing me to haemmorage and nearly die. Which was unfortunate because it triggered a post-partum pre-ecclampsia seizure. Which again caused me to almost die. So now, remind me. Why is it okay to force a woman to use her body to keep someone else alive - when in no other situation that is legal or okay?
39. Again you and the point make a huge leap yet again but go off on wanting to control women’s bodies babe.
40. It’s crazy you’re still talking to me and can’t detect a troll when you’re talking to one. I brought up cum on a cookie and you think this is a battle of wits? Regardless I’m glad I changed your mind and you’re now pro abortion!
41. >you don’t care that illegal abortions out of desperation frequently kill the women attempting them because you don’t care about life Whose life? >ALWAYS prioritise the women giving birth over the possibility of a child It's not a possible child, it's a child. Why is there a conflict when the mother and baby are healthy? >we will never agree because we fundamentally disagree on the concept of conception. We do agree that it is unforgivable to kill a baby. That is why you are trying to pretend that an abortion is not the killing of a baby. Funnily enough, no-one is just outright saying it is fine to kill babies, cuz that would be insane to everyone. But fudging around with the issue and lying, that makes it okay, that makes it all better. >outlawing abortions for personal reasons over medical reasons makes them harder for people who medically need them Same as how euthanasia is tricky cuz awful people will take advantage of legal euthanasia to kill old people who don't want to die, either cuz they can't be bothered caring for them or want to take their money. Funny how awful people ruin it for everyone else. >the pro-forced birth community That's a lie, we're not discussing rape here. If it's rape or there are medical issues, fine. But when it is a healthy consensual pregnancy, there is no force. You're using exaggerated language because honest language means you lose the argument. >With domestic violence on the rise in australia with little being done about it by our government, one of the worst things i can imagine is banning abortions and forcing more children to grow up in violent and broken households. Your solution to protect children from domestic violence is to kill them? You cannot be serious.
42. Humans need to eat, sleep, find shelter and have children in order to stay alive. Having babies used to be considered a good thing, not a curse. This bizarre antinatalism that has taken grip of society is only going to end badly. After all, it's not like those aborted babies are going to have any rights or choices, since they died in the womb. People like you who only view babies as a clump of cells to be disposed like a bag of rubbish are not sexist, so what is the word? Something bad. There must be a word for that. Homicidal? Ah! Infanticidal. You are infanticidal.
43. Why? Are you against killing of babies? You just made 2 pro-abortion posts.
44. >You're a misogynist for wanting to take the right to reproductive healthcare away from women. Literally nothing to do with the sex of the babies?? It is not healthcare to kill a healthy baby consensually conceived, any more than it is healthcare to kill a healthy elderly person who want to live. And it is "literally" nothing to do with misogyny. Any man involved in the infanticide is awful too. >'Forced birth' refers to forcing pregnant women to carry a foetus, that they want to abort, to term. Whether or not the conception was consensual is completely irrelevant to that discussion, keep up Forced birth is forcing a woman to get pregnant, aka rape. When a woman has consensual sex there is no force involved. You're using these dishonest terms to try to justify the killing of babies for no reason. If parents try to kill their 10 year old child, and they are prevented from doing so, we don't refer to that as "forced parenthood". It's just unbelievably dishonest language from your infanticide mindset. >No fully grown babies are being aborted, when will you people stop spreading this obvious lie? I haven't said anything about fully grown babies. Stop being dishonest. >Over 90% of terminations are done before 14 weeks and at that point, the foetus is closer to a mole than a fully grown baby lol. A foetues is never anything like a mole. No-one is protesting dermatologist clinics, trying to dissuade people from having their moles removed. Again, just constant dishonesty from the infanticide mindset.
45. So you think that haemorrhaging during delivery and then having a seizure is things going well? That's not normal. Most women do not experience that. You had a bad experience. It sucks, and it is good that you survived. If you knew then what you know now, that you would haemorrhage, but with no guarantee of survival, would you still have gone through with your pregnancy? Was your daughter worth it? You talk about force, but we're not talking about rape here, only healthy pregnancies conceived consensually. And of course you seem to be overlooking the fact that if everyone keeps aborting their pregnancies, there won't be any people left soon. For now abortion cultures like Australia are keeping their populations going by importing people from non-abortion cultures. What happens if the whole world adopts the same attitude? Where are we going to import people from then, other planets? I suppose we'll find out soon.
46. Was never not Im just not going pretend a protest for a problem that doesn’t exist isn’t being attended by complete and utter fucktards . If I had to guess your probably a lesbian who protests for Palestinians but if you went there they would stone you to death. Time to check back in to the mental health clinic Ivy
47. i agree with the accepted scientific term that a fertilised egg is an embryo once implanted in the uterus walls, that embryo is a fetus at the ~10 week mark, and that this fetus isn’t a baby until it is able to independently take its first breath outside the womb, which funnily enough is also the Australian governments legal timeline. in no cases on abortions do i believe a baby is being killed. you see a healthy 8week pregnancy in the same regard as a 20week pregnancy and that makes zero sense from a developmental and biological standpoint. sure i’ve used baby to refer to a fetus, but from a biological and legal standpoint they arnt the same. If you seriously see a fetus in the same light as a two year old, you are insane, sure a healthy fetus has the potential to become a two year old, but so does the egg my body decides to pass every once in a while.
48. Shocking! Local woman cares about her right to access reproductive healthcare!
49. You’re more than welcome to carry to term when you get pregnant mate.
