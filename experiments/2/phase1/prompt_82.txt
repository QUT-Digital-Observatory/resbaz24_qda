Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Ahhh you seem to have your parties mixed up bro. Bloody NPCs these days, you lot really gotta get your shit in order. Can't provide facts, can't provide policy can't even provide an explanation but yeah nah our grandchildren are paying for it. Go home your drunk
2. Well, millennials surpassed them for the largest voting group in 2021, so we can live in hope. Although experiencing the average intelligence/disinterest in politics of my generation, it's not much of a hope.
3. Boomer here. There’s no chance I’m voting for a party that will restrict women’s reproductive rights and refused to release its costing before the media blackout. Some of us actually have a soul.
4. Local government is more direct involvement with people though Development approval, buses, libraries, pot holes on your street, fluoride in your water, all these are the council's responsibility Yes there are over laps but for me I would hand policing and healthcare over to the federal government and delegate the rest to local councils The issue is there is a such a huge disconnect between governing the people in Brisbane vs someone in Roma. State government has out grown what it was created to achieve 120 years ago
5. Ah yes we've heard I'll vote for trump if he cracks down on youth crime so many times..
6. I wouldn't be doing it properly if I saw no difference between the candidates. Compulsory voting is wrong
7. I think bloke above forgot to put in a /s
8. There's also supposedly a hole in their budget they just released and mention of making cuts to public services so there's a very high chance of it happening again.
9. I think that QLD and TAS are the only states where using an ambulance is free. And the rest of the country probably wishes it was the same for them.
10. No, you're incorrect about that. Their plan was to keep code 1 and code 2 for the QAS.
11. Last time I got an ambulance was in SA and it was like $1500. That was like 7 years ago. They actually can't do anything if u don't pay or force u to pay and many people just don't.
12. I watched Steven Miles bench 100kg. Ain't no way he could be a bad leader, that man is built to carry Queensland.
13. Exactly. I believe once voting starts all costings should be available, policies viewable, ads/campaigning stopped. Let people sit with all the information and vote over the course of a week or two.
14. It did. Many people who voted early or postal voted for the LNP wanted to change, particularly when all the abortion stuff started hitting the media
15. You know why the government still relies so much on external consultants though, because Newman sacked a shit tonne of public servants back in his day, and we haven't been able to hire them back to keep getting the work done so have to pay triple the price to get the same work done. I would know, I'm working for a contractor who's doing so because it's an open market to exploit 🤷 if we don't someone else will. The issue if you cut all that is that there's no one and no money to actually pick up all that work, that's already not got enough staffing to get done so we will just go further backwards, into debt while also cutting funding to other important state government programs or initiatives. How anyone could actually vote for this waste of space wanker is beyond me. Miles is the first premier we've had in a long while who is a straight shooter and gets to the bloody point. Isn't pussy footing around the curly questions and has not only proven early on he can deliver fast and effective reforms and programs that benefit everyday queenalanders.
16. Labor has constantly kept its costings updated on its website with each pledge made. Unlike LNP with its campaign of slogans, not policies. At least Labor are upfront with their spending, and how in 3 years the books will be back in the black. Much of the borrowings will be going toward much needed long term infrastructure which is a good thing. Infra becomes an asset which outweights the cost of the debt. Borrowing money to provide tax cuts (as LNP will do with its plan to reduce mining royalties) reduces the ability of the state to pay back debt and provide for other needs, such as infra. Labor builds, LNP destroys. Look no further than NZ where the idiotic National Party (LNPs cousin) has destroyed the NZ economy by cancelling every infrastructure project, and borrowed billions to pay for unnecessary tax cuts. Their health system is also borked. LNP will follow the same pathway in QLD if elected.
17. 100%, true that costing were part of that for Labor. They also had tangible policies instead of vague ideas. The costings aren’t a surprise from the LNP. “Just make it something people won’t really understand and that we can fob off when questioned.”
18. The vote was to add recognition of, and ongoing formal role in policies and laws affecting Indigenous Australian to our constitution, not the specifics of it. This meant the government of the day could spend a lot or a little on it, but it had to exist. They weren’t hiding the cost, it didn’t exist yet. It’s telling that even now, you didn’t bother to try understand it.
19. Part of the reason consultancy spend is so high is due to the cuts they made 12 years ago to a lot of highly competent public servants who probably went to B4s and charged them 3-4x their then salaries as externals They've made verbal overtures into setting up an internal consultancy of some description, but meh, hopes are not high
20. The way u wrote those sounds like the NBN all over again 🤦
21. Not Christian but may God have mercy on us all in the next few weeks.
22. GC is wall to wall conservative or ‘independent’ if they don’t want the LNP stink on them.
23. They were all greens and now they are way too far left radicals. Labor becoming a mix of themselves and greens really
24. >Ron De Santis Who is that? >voting him in He hasn't been voted in. Do other Australian states not have the LNP?
25. I wonder whether the predicted landslide meant Miles was able to take the risk of being honest.
26. You should never judge a person's competency by what they look like. Love him or hate him Miles is an incredibly competent person. He has a phd, worked in the union movement, started his own business, and absolutely shot up the Labor party ranks. Miles was only voted into office in 2015. He was the environmental minister who developed our climate transition plan. He was health minister and deputy premier during covid, during his time in this role he led the decriminalisation of abortion.
27. The fact you're comparing "smug twat, barely competent " and "child predator" as two evils, rather than one slightly irritating and one evil, says a lot about you.
28. Queenslander Here. The state needs a shakeup. Youth crime maybe looked at as a small issue, due to lack of action it has impacted numerous people particularly in the regional centres ; 3 women killed by a 'youth' joy rider in a stolen car in my LGA. The govt reaction is to change the speed limit from 80 to 60km. Another woman was killed by a speeding driver doing over 160kms in a 60km zone. A night you can hear the cars speeding, you can see the rubber marks on the road, lack of action by govt to investigate and stop, until you count the special task force which arrived for 3 nights around 3 weeks ago. Govt unaction, resolved in the death of 4 woman in my LGA due to joy riders. A friend who owns a small business, the business has been break into like 5 times in the last 6 months - 10 x thousands in glass replacement, 10 x thousands in unsellable stock, and the last time they stole a packet of toilet paper. These offenders are released and re-offend. This is a single mother, due to this had to close her profitable (before the breakins) business. You can drive out of my regional town and see 3 burnt out cars and more write out cars (stolen cars, increases our insurance). A kid working to save up for a new scooter, it gets stolen (numerous stories every week). So youth crime is visibly higher in the regions.
29. Yeah, that's exactly the experience my wife had too. For the singular ALP and the single greens person there were at least 10 LNP DnD 10 ON people out the voting centre EDIT: 10 LNP and 10 ON people, not DnD
30. As least Crisafulli has held a job outside of politics. Are there any Labor politicians that have done that?
31. All from the same bucket that our tax goes into, so don’t be fooled, we pay for it one way or another.
32. Haha, clever buddy. Problem is I’m the one paying massive amounts of tax to supplement dole bludgers like you. It’s me paying your power bill and rego. So yeah, you’re welcome.
33. Our bill jumped up and extra $200 this quarter and we have used it way less than the last one. Last quarter heater was pumped heaps. Didn't get much use this quarter. Next quarter AC will be cranked 🤷 Still a far cry from the bills we had in SA but they are still jumping up
34. Causes property prices to go up tho as people spend more $
35. I’m old enough to have experienced life under Joh, Qld is vastly, and I mean vastly, different. The CM has greatly diminished in its influence. Those of us either in the unions or with the ALP hardly even consider it anymore.
36. And Newman just reinforced that, by reminding us of the worst excesses of the conservatives here. Borbidge was never popular enough to hold on, and Springborg toiled but was never going to overcome that as a National. The LNPs problem is that QLD Labor has quite a few tendencies they would agree with normally, but can't because Labor bad, and in order to oppose them, they have to go further. The irony of the nominally centre left party drifting slightly right of centre being bad for the nominally centre right one is that the LNP achieves a lot of what it should want to do by having Labor elected... Except for winning elections.
37. Yeah what the fuck are we thinking. Burn and destroy.
38. I think it came from the Fitzgerald Inquiry history more so than Murdoch’s papers. People saw how corrupt JBP’s government became et such a long period and they have long memories. The unfortunate part is that while long service can corrupt, that doesn’t necessarily mean it will. In this case, it hasn’t.
39. We get it - and I wouldn't put it past either major to run a scare campaign late on a federal issue for a state election! Labor is the natural party of government in QLD because it's actually quite a conservative Labor party, helped by the fact that the LNP atttacts those right of centre with reactionary ideas here. You'll hear the word restore a lot with the LNP, rather than create.
40. Why cast a donkey vote and risk voting for someone whose values you don't agree with? Just draw a line through the paper and be done with it. I used to feel the same way about compulsory voting until I saw how hard some groups in other countries fight to make it so incredibly difficult for people to vote that they just don't bother. Compulsory voting means that the government also has to make voting accessible. I'd rather that than the alternative.
41. Na they are saying the opposite. Just all the people who arent dumb fucks know it's coming regardless of what they say
42. 2 plates bench should be requirement to even be considered for any leadership role. 1 plate for the ladies.
43. Do you have any actual evidence, not opinion, that backs up your claims?
44. Your contention is simultaneously that we can’t afford to rehire but can afford triple rates to external consultants? Absolutely the quality of thinking I’ve come to expect from your sector.
45. I’m also one of those contractors doing work for the state because there is no FTE for me - and I regularly do overtime. It’s a raw deal for me and everyone else. The labour hire company treats me like dirt, it’s so demeaning. I’m always holding on hope for a proper contract but with budget cuts now the LNP are back I feel more hopeless than ever.
46. They definitely were hired back. The ability for the government to operate hasn’t changed. Let’s be honest please.
47. I'm not saying the Newman cuts or the proposed LNP cuts are net good, but cuts do have their place from time to time. Generally, their best use is to force managers to make inefficient processes more efficient, thereby removing the need for so many bodies. If cuts are too swift / too strong, then it can have the inverse effect - lots of things fail at once, the smart people leave, and management needs to pay contractors who are disincentivised to optimise.
48. I am not trying to defend or demean either party here, just according to your initial logic Labor to should be excluded from the ballot also. Both parties do this because they get beaten over the head by the media and the other side if they do. Likewise, opposition's are loath to do it earlier because until caretaker mode anything they submit to treasury can be requested under freedom of information requests (essentially allowing the government to access there intended election policies before the election). This means that increasingly opposition parties from both sides don't submit their policies for costing until only around 30days before the election, meaning they really can't get them out much before the last week anyway. The system is cooked and doesn't support decent policy formation by either side when they are in opposition.
49. Here’s the thing, I didn’t say he was incompetent, I said he gives off barely competent vibes, there is a huge difference. The truth is, the first time I heard of him, he was on the news ripping up an invoice from the NSW government (politicking) since the few times I’ve seen it heard of him, he just comes across poorly but the media is good at that.
50. But they are politicians, that makes them inherently evil. That doesn’t mean they are on the same level of evil.
51. Your logical fallacy is anecdote. The data clearly contradicts your anecdote and several of these crimes you talk about you'd have no idea if they were youths or not. The biggest source of crime currently are 30-39 year olds, not youths.
52. > 10 LNP DnD They out here playing dungeons and dragons now?
53. Bit fucking late to be asking that, mate. Have a Google. What good has LNP ever done for the average person? All they do is get in, destroy the budget and give their rich friends whatever the fuck they ask for. Unless you earn a *lot* of money, you're about to vote against the best interests of almost everyone in the state.
54. Are you capable of asking a question that isn’t loaded?
55. Labor helps the people, rebates on your power bill, funding to public services etc. Liberals benefit the rich, the only people who benefit from them is those who have the money to own several homes, are considering buying more, probably have some successful business running too etc.
56. I hope you’re a multi millionaire already my friend because if not, you’ve voting against your own future.
57. Several things and enough to deserve being put back in. This is not a hard decision. If you’re struggling g with it I have grave concerns for you.
58. 3 years of consistent surplus without completely gutting the public sector this time around and Miles has introduced some pretty damn decisive reforms that have genuinely made people's lives just a tad better when they're struggling so hard right now.
59. Uh well since your party decided to hate queer people I don't really have to pay attention to what Labor does beyond not hating queer people as well. Since you know, I like being free to live my life with my fellow Australians. So I guess to answer your question. They are less bigoted is why I vote for them. Out of self interest sure but I'm sure as fuck not going to vote for a party that would actively go out of their way to make my rights and QoL worst.
60. Make Crisafulli look like a complete arse. No my apologies, he did that himself when he couldn’t show a set and stand up for women’s rights.
61. The one we are aware of, where he helped extort money for a training organisation? That the job you’re blowing off about?
62. I'm not sure trading while insolvent is quite the point you think it is
63. How is that a measure of quality for a politician? How does it make you a better plumber if you have experience as a fence builder?
64. Dude was a shit stain working as a journalist for a shit stain network before politics and was insolvent trading after he got voted out previously. It's really not the flex you think it is.
65. No he fucking hasn't. He's failed at everything he's tried to do. He fucked up several businesses he first handedly ran into the ground head first and got himself done for insolvent trading then went ahead and syphoned government funds WHILST under investigation and paying hush money for it... The slimy cunt belongs in the same jails he's planning to put ur kids in...
66. Doesn't make it bad, just cause we are paying for it out of taxes, that we are already paying for. Means that it's still more money in citizens hands
67. Typical LNP reply. Dole bludgers are a very very small minority. Same as the youth crime bullshit that has been spun around this time... Totally feeding into the bullshit again. Is every bit of dribble that leaves ur mouth the same old party rhetoric? And never been on the dole in my life 🤷 so u ain't paid shit of mine bud. I was military for 10 years and now I'm teaching... I pay and have paid my fair share of tax... But whatever helps u sleep at night 🙏 U don't wanna pay massive amount of tax then reduce ur income. Then u won't pay so much tax and u can be just like everyone else and u will have nothing to complain about right? Fuck off out of here that's 1000% another avenue of LNP thinking. U got urs so fuck everyone else right?
68. You’re in a bubble my friend. Go spend an hour looking at the comments of the Facebook posts of the Labor accounts
69. And me, and my father, mother, maternal grandfather and grandmother and my paternal grandmother...? Shall we continue?
70. They most definitely have not recovered across many departments, I know because I'm currently contracting a dozen staff to fill the void a decade later as it never recovered. The industry I never made it into because I couldn't leave Brisbane is still being proped up by private developers and consultants charging several times the rate a government employee would have cost. The vacuum the Newman changes caused absolutely stuffed so many industries well and proper in Queensland and it's still costing the government as a result, regardless of who is in power. The talent that was in various departments has gone, the private sector has become more enticing for staff because they are making more off the government and can pay higher wages. The government can't just throw more money on wages because it's tied to specific rates that private sector just put bid, and charge straight back to the government department. Youve got sectors like nursing and teaching that were stripped out in different ways due to lack of resources or not growing capacity or forcing people to work in overcrowded under funded facilities, meaning people left those industries due to poor conditions or burnout as there wasn't enough staff. This still hasn't recovered to this day. Having seen first hand how a number of departments do operate, the ability to be effective and efficient is far harder due to contracting the work out. If there is dead weight that can be handled case by case, role by role just like any other workforce. Removing the position and/or the man power by chopping people or roles left right and centre doesn't solve anything at all. You do realise the majority of public servants that get cut by the LNP are never the middle or upper management right, it's the workers on the coal face, dealing with the shit first hand. Any upper middle management that does get cut, usually gets replaced by some LNP ministers mate or cousin or whatever who either continues to do the same shit job the last person did or a whole lot less.
71. They absolutely weren’t and some who did were hired back under labour hire. It’s appalling. The department I’m working in is stretched.
72. Cuts don't force managers to make processes more efficient. They force managers to either outsource or overload their staff, neither of which is efficient.
73. Finally half a voice of reason and look at Reddit response
74. Oh, I 100% believe every party should have to have policies and costings released. You are correct and thanks for explaining. Yes they would get beaten over the head the media and by voters, which would be great. Forcing parties to reveal plans… yes please, great. It sucks things are the way they are. In my mind, everyone should be able to get a clear description and costings of each party policy well before voting. I even think it could be standardised, no fluff, it should be like a phone/internet contract or the nutrition labels on food.
75. The main difference is Labor confirmed during the election campaign X, Y, Z policies were funded by coal royalties, and A, B, C policies are funded by borrowings and increasing debt etc. They released the page by page details on Thursday, but we already had clarity on their spending weeks ago.
76. I don't like to judge things on vibes personally as I prefer concrete evidence and information
77. I should add, not every politician is bad at their job, many are decent, I grew up around politicians, many of my jobs have had me around them this is why I firmly believe they are all evil, even ones that I personally get along with and respect, at the end of the day, the vast majority are going to put their interests above the communities and those who don’t, rarely see a second term.
78. People who would step up and represent you, be the voice of their people, where you would otherwise have none, put up with public scrutiny, and cop being called "inherently evil" by ignorant twats like you, you think those people are inherently evil? You wouldn't have one eighth of the courage required to do that job, just sit on the sidelines and complain about them all. And the fucked part, is you think you're doing the right thing. I'm a full time working man, never committed a crime, always paid my taxes, supported my wife on single income so she could get her degree. Hell, I've only ever had three traffic tickets: defect vehicle, follow too closely and no seat belt. I fully intend to enter politics in the future. To represent a community I care about, to be part of improving our society for us all, and to right injustices. All of a sudden, that makes me inherently evil? Pull your head in mate.
79. Evidence for this claim please? And are you talking qld wide or where this person lives?
80. According to them Labor is comparable to Tiamat, I wouldn't be surprised
81. Don't forget last time when they removed all restrictions on pesticide use and increased land clearing beyond even Brazil in their best effort to kill the reef.
82. Worth noting out that this is EVERY LNP government.. not just singular terms or staffings and both state and federal 🤦 100% agree :(
83. Disagree but all good. Moot point now they’ve been ousted.
84. Someone’s got their knickers in a knot. Military hey, so I paid your salary for 10 years. Again, you’re very welcome.
85. Everything runs fine. Amazing what happens when dead wood is cut off. Not much.
86. Job still getting done. The public service don’t work like the private sector so it’s really not a valid point. Too much dead wood and it needs further culling.
87. Doing nothing means nothing changes - what do you suggest a senior manager should do if they perceive that processes are unoptimised and wasteful?
88. I didn’t judge, I asked a question and simply stated the vibes I got.
