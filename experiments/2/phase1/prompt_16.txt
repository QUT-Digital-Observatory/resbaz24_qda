Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. There is a very good chance the LNP will enforce all public servants to return to office 100%. When that happens PT will likely saturate in peak times. That will then give them a reason to restore full fares, at least during peak usage times.
2. its not a huge majority that they have, dont know why they would want to rub it in labor seats faces. Like it or not, the LNP still need to government for brisbane even if they prefer not to.
3. It will go next budget. The early, the better as the collective memory of it will disapate by the time 4 yrs rolls around. You'll be grateful though as the compromise will be a lower fare tariff than before. It also plays well outside the se qld corner where regions don't particularly like their money be spent in the cities
4. “Youth criminal gangs are using public transportation to get into *your suburb*!”
5. in all seriousness, i can see this happening. not unusual to see pan handlers on the train. A normal person doesn't think much of this. But in the hands of weaponized media and LNP folk who drive trucks around....
6. What did the greens have to do with 50C fairs other than taking credit?
7. > God I love this Greens & Labor initiative. Don't see any other labor governments in Australia doing it. Pretty fucking poor. Greens would though.
8. Not to mention that cities need "essential workers" if they want to stay alive. I'd think twice about paying an hour of my pay to go work 5-6 hours in a cafe.
9. I worry the LNP has no love of Brisbane, and dont see any loss in increasing fares again, letting existing infrastructure rot, and slowing down/stopping future PT expansions.
10. I recall they ran a campaign that the sky was going to fall in. News alert, it didn’t.
11. > LNP BCC was livid, absolutely furious about the change Why were they cranky about it, other than LNP vs Labor? My understanding was that the state gov was going to replace the lost value in fares so BCC would financially be exactly the same as before. Doing some reading now and state gov even paid BCC an extra $50 mil to prepare for any extra services required.
12. Its absurd to me that the LNP council doesn't seem to have much passion for the city they govern.
13. Youth crime may not be an issue in Brisbane city but it sure is in the regional electorates. It shows by the results, basically all blue except Brisbane fringe. If you talk to anyone in a regional centre and they will have or definitely know someone affected by youth crime. Assaults, car thefts, break and enters. Labor put their head in the sand for too many years, the Townsville rallies barely got any coverage in Brisbane and the labor MPs didn’t show up.
14. The funny thing is having less cars on the road helps motorists not get stuck in traffic.
15. Crisafulli was the Minister for Local Government. You can look at what he did then directly.
16. It'll be an early sign of people getting what they voted for if they scrap it after the trial.
17. Exactly, the way they promised it was so sketchy. No actual clarification.
18. If you live in the ideological circles of the LNP, cars are freedom, and public transport is socialism that needs to be ran down. We will wait and see, but expect no new PT investments in Brisbane for the foreseeable future
19. They were careful to phrase everything in terms of it not being in their plan. "Not in the plan" means that they haven't committed one way or the other.
20. Oh sweetie, they also said they had no plans for abortion. Just you wait....

23. So you'd be happier with bus services just as slow but cost more than 50c? Increase in demand will be the only way they will see a need to increase the frequency of services
24. For trains the commuter network is almost completely subsidised by commercial use. High ticket prices for trains only serves to limit usage so they don’t clog up the freight transport runs. This is why we will never get highspeed commuter rail in QLD, they need to move aside for the services that pay for the network. Also the less people who use it the higher the cost per person is so they can use that as an excuse to cut services more.
25. >The election was far closer than anyone thought it would be Not really, DC has a majority government and he now has "Mandate brain" he will cut cut cut anything that a well to do Liberal voter doesn't need, while boosting anything that they want. How will he replace the mining royalties he gives back to his buddies, he will have to take it from the Labor voters. The cheap public transport will be eroded. Watch him GIVE away Victoria Park land to developers to pay for an Olympic stadium. He might dress it up as a 100 year lease, which is the same as giving it away. Watch him sell off all the green energy projects now that he has devalued them by guaranteeing coal projects. Watch him sell off major infrastructure. There is no limit to the stuff he will sell off. Powerstations, Green energy projects that are close to completion, airports, roads, beaches, Victoria Park, Gold Coast waterways (assuming a high profile Liberal doesn't object to their views being compromised).
26. It was viable with the royalties tax. That was the point.
27. Where did you get 1.2 billion from? The cost for the six month trial was $150 million.
28. I really hope they're doing some good data collection during the trial so we can see accurate costing and flow on effects. In my ideal world, the 50cent fares will increase demand to a point they HAVE to introduce better infrastructure and more regular frequency. Wouldn't that be nice 🙂
29. Or… we could tax corporations and mining royalties properly, and do both the increased public transport infrastructure/services and the 50c fares. The health improvements and decreased road congestion (both related to lower emissions) would probably help substantially pay for it anyway…
30. Yeah I’m not sure where you pulled the 1 billion per year figure from but now that the LNP is in it’s clear that the 50c fares benefit those in the Brisbane Region leaving a lot to be desired for regional towns. I’m a fan of it in the short to medium term as it’s a blunt instrument and easier for the government to apply rather than have to figure out the infrastructure needed for frequency of routes as you say, which will require a longer term outlook. But for now I think it’s a good idea to continue.
31. Fares were already subsidised before 50c fares came in. They’re never going to get them to break even levels.
32. It was paid for with the Mining royalties that will be cut back. So I wouldn’t get used to it.
33. We used to live 4k from the city. The bus stop was literally outside our house. Like on our fence. Parking in the city was cheaper than the bus fare and we got to leave when we wanted. It was stupid. I have been saying for years that public transport should be almost free. But now the LNP is in they will have to raise the price to funnel money into their friends pockets.
34. It will be scrapped. The party of joh bjelke Petersen always hated government services and always cut back. They hate the gays so gays will be lucky to keep out of jail or avoid being beaten up by the police. Joh hated the environment so the barrier reef is doomed even more.
35. My toddler absolutely loves trains. The highlight of his week is getting to see one or go on one. 50c fares are awesome I hope they stay
36. More people using public transport means an increase in traffic? Please explain how you believe that works.
37. What are you talking about lmao. There are heaps of poor suburbs with a train station or busses, and having flat fares proportionally helps the poorer suburbs more because they tend to be further out. Besides, there were election commitments for public transport infrastructure (typically there'd be more but the LNP only wanted to focus on crime). Regardless, cutting fares = more users = more demand = better case for more investment in infrastructure.
38. It socks arse that it works. I feel the older people are who it works on more so then younger no?
39. You do know that as a state we are $132.2B in debt, right? Up from $85B in 2016 and after the Labor government raided the state superannuation coffers to the tune of $10B to pay it down.
40. Yeah,it's funny how "We don't have as much money as we thought" is only ever used to justify decreasing spending rather than to justify not cutting taxes or royalties.
41. They also supposedly changed their position on the coal royalties after ALP passed the Progressive Coal Royalties Protection. Sure it’s possible to reverse the amendment to the resources ACT, but it’s a lot more challenging then just adjusting the regulation that was previously used, so they claim there will be no changes to royalties until the next election. The only reason I’ll say this every time is so we remember, so we can hammer them if they change it, and be vocal about then changing a position they agreed to before the election.
42. They will do it far more subtly than Newman though. Blanket hiring freezes and reducing the public service via attrition, with money then spent on contractors to make up for it.
43. I made a more detailed comment about this yesterday but essentially if the coal price doesn't go over $175 a tonne then no additional revenue is generated with the changes the government made to the royalties. And so far in 2024 it hasn't.
44. They did, back in September they committed to maintaining it (and expanding it to all regional public transport networks as well). Was in response to labour commitments to keep it around the same time. Think the announcement was 14th of September.
45. LNP junk mail they sent me spruiked keeping 50c fares, it was an election promise
46. We'd be doing okay if hydro projects weren't consistently shut down over the last few decades.
47. Yeah, cut taxs and sell off the revenue raising aspects of the state, and then point to the lack of money as an excuse to cut things further. Honestly, once you realise the true nature of the LNP its impossible to vote for them ever again and you really start feeling insane watching everyone fall for what you know is an insane choice to choose if you give two shits about the state and other human beings who are not wealthy.
48. There's a video of Steve Minikin calling it a farce. But the lib council who hates life and anything good for the city outside their electorates, also did.
49. You're an evil genius. 'The fares are still 50c, so long as you're travelling off peak' I can see that working. You should get a job working for the LNP!
50. The flip side of the small majority is - some of the rural backbenchers will get ideas. They will have quite a lot of leverage if they threaten to jump ship and join Katter. Wouldn't be at all surprised if we have a minority government by the time of the next election.
51. it would be worse to scrap it after everyone is used to it for years
52. You jest but that’s the rhetoric happening in nicer bayside suburbs and on the SMBI island. “We love the 50c fares, so cheap! but we hate all the westie randoms who come here now 🙉 cant get a seat on the ferry 😤😤😤”
53. IIRC I saw some articles of people who frequentd the ferries before reduced fairs complaining that 50c fairs resulted in more people on the ferries. They could probably twist it that the rabble are ruining the experience for hard working class ferry goers
54. It wasn’t their policy but they have been pushing for free public transport for many years, which probably helped get it on the agenda tbh. Their election commitment was to maintain 50c public transport then transition to free in a few years. Ofc greens can say whatever as they aren’t forming a majority government and I’m not trying to defend them per se, just explaining their position on PT…
55. They've been pushing for free (not just practically-free) PT for **years** While they obviously didn't bring it in (because they've never held enough seats) you cannot deny that this policy has been heavily influenced by their campaigning on it, specifically.
56. They had a policy in Queensland for $1 fair for years. Duh.
57. Nah you got it right at the start don’t try and find a better explanation mate. BCC are LNP, State were ALP. That’s why they were mad, no other reason needed
58. ~~I don't get the~~ *~~specifics~~* ~~buy my understanding from friends in Council is it's about funding. Something along the lines of most of the infrastructure/maintenance is paid for by the State, but the ticketing revenue specifically was going to BCC, so it puts a big dent in the city's budget rather than the State's.~~ Oh, I didn't read your comment properly, I didn't know about the compensation. Yeah, I don't know... maybe it's about control? I really don't know. All I know is aforementioned mates in Council confirmed the Councilors were spitting chips.
59. I'll have you know that they are very passionate about making sure their own suburbs don't have any outsiders moving in and changing things.
60. Unfortunately, many find it hard to grasp this simple fact!
61. But did you really expect anything else from the LNP
62. Yes but they can’t just change it overnight on a win. Things need to happen first, and people can protest
63. No. I believe that in a densely populated city, public transport should be developed so that it's as convenient as driving, and subsidised so that it's affordable for the majority of residents and visitors. My fear is that the LNP will no see money spent on public transport as an investment, but as an expense. They will cut funds and claim that they have saved money. There will be a cost saving in the short term but over the medium term there will be increased demand for road expansion and maintenance, and over the long term there will be a negative effect on public health: both of which increase the burden on the taxpayer.
64. Do you realise that buses in regional areas are privately owned? How does one increase demand for something that doesn't exist?
65. >Not really, DC has a majority government and he now has "Mandate brain" he will cut cut cut anything that a well to do Liberal voter doesn't need, while boosting anything that they want. The ALP will probably wind up with 32, 33 seats - and any bets a month ago would have said that they were at serious risk of being reduced to a cricket team.
66. ok. it also important to note it was a pre-election 6 months trial. which means it was always possible the trial would be canned after the election regardless who wins. Given I have no faith on any politician, there was always the possibility even if labor won, they would still can it. Just saying, cause people were going on about it as if it was a done deal. it wasn't, its even listed in government documents as a trial only. If the taxes were paid on royalties, that would also be subjected to fluctuating commodity prices. Im looking at the 2024-2025 budget strategy outlook for qld. With respect t royalties "This revenue growth was primarily driven by increased royalties, due to the higher global prices being received by coal producers from late 2021 to mid-2023, combined with the impact of the new progressive coal royalty tiers introduced in the 2022–23 Budget. • However, as previously expected, these temporarily high commodity prices have since fallen substantially, and are expected to continue to decline across 2024–25 and 2025 –26" pp.92 having said the above, it appears the total cost of the scheme is 150 million for the 6 months. so My bet is they will keep it. but that's a cost of $300 million a year x 4 years = total cost 1.2 billion just for travel. excluding hospitals, health care, education, roads, electricity etc etc. Im in NSW so it would be interesting to see if something like that would spring up.
67. Based on the two ferries on a Saturday evening I saw full last weekend… I’d say we’re already there
68. My firm was involved in auditing their costings report, so I know what is in there. They do have a budget saying they will keep the 50 cent fee permanent. And at the time we signed off, I looked at what Labor had on their website (Labor updated their costings daily during the campaign), LNP had a slightly higher budget on that. I am just providing the info re what OP is asking about. It doesn't mean I am an LNP supporter. I personally wouldn't vote for a conservative party. And after seeing what they are doing with their costings in details, and trying to get it audited?! MAN, YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH I WANTED THEM TO LOSE! 🤣🤣🤣 I won't elaborate the details coz I am not allowed to, but the way they do things is just......OMFG!!! THEY MUST NOT RUN THE STATE! AND THIS JOB HAD COST ME SO MUCH BOTH MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY, THIS IS ACTUALLY PERSONAL! LOL! ANY ACCOUNT CAN BE THEIR BOTS BUT I AM CERTAINLY THE LAST ONE! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 It is just I couldn't get my citizenship in time to be able to vote. And yeah, I am upset that they actually won.
69. Why not, it’s just so easy to avoid paying. And yes I know it’s wrong.
70. He doesn't need to have logic in his decision making process he's obviously a lib
71. You are correct. The issue is in the suburbs train stations tend to be in places with little to no practicality, they're often at the edge of a suburb (ie: not in walking distance for people) There are exceptions. Banyo and Zillmere stations are close to shops, I would consider that good planning. I live within driving distance of the Redcliffe line, the train line skirts around North Lakes, the most populous suburb in the area without actually servicing it. The Murrumba Downs station is in a weird zone away from any development. In fact a lot of train stations around Brisbane seem to be in some place where they can't bother the NIMBYs. I hope the 50c fares stay and I hope they encourage medium density development around the stations. It's a good start but there's a lot that needs to be done
72. Public transport use was down from pre covid, so yeah the free transport will hopefully get us back to pre covid levels. But in other parts of the world where free(basically free) transport has been trialled it doesn’t move the dial much in terms of use. So yes as a cost of living policy it will help, as a policy to increase use of public transport it’s not the best. The demand for public transport is already there, you don’t need a business case for it. What you need to do is make it more attractive, and that means more routes, more frequent services, etc. Edit: Just to be clear I voted labour, I don’t think the LNP is going to fix this issue. I just don’t think 50c fares this is the right way.
73. What possibly could have happened between 2016 and 2024 that could run up a massive debt. Maybe some kind of a pandemic but on a global scale? But thankfully our previous Labor government were good economic managers who managed to deliver 3 surpluses in a row. Primarily due to their amendments to mining royalties, which the LNP have threatened to diminish. I'm willing to give the LNP the benefit of the doubt for now, but let's not pretend that the previous government were economically inept. https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/100536#:~:text=Queensland%20Treasurer%20Cameron%20Dick%20handed,billion%20surplus%20in%202022%2D23.
74. The current Labor state budget from now to 2028 relied heavily borrowings to make ends meet. We simply don't, as a state have enough money pre election let alone post election moving forwards. Or to put it another way, the state was and is not getting enough tax to cover spending.
75. I’ve never been called a westie before, has a nice ring to it.
76. Hah, so has the branches of labor. The greens had zero influence on the decision, its just nice they claim to agree. The labor government does not care about what the greens want *more* than their own branch parties. They dont pull this kind of policy from nowhere. I can absolutely deny that the greens had any part in it because they simply didn't. So you sorta understand how the process work in qld only, branches agree on and propose policy to the next level of qld state gov for them to consider, more brances asking for the same policy means its more likely to be actioned by the government, branches communicate with one another to bring up the same policys so they gain more traction, its one of the most democractic process in the country. I can guarantee you they were talking about cheaper/free transport 2 years ago in the branches. The greens just say it to make their voters feel good, given the greens track record, they would have delayed it if they could.
77. Greens never clearly outlined how they would fund free/50cent fares. Also Greens want to end mining so they couldn’t propose using mining royalties to fund policies if they want to end the source of said revenue. Bit of a tricky point whereas ALP can do such funding arrangements.
78. That doesn't mean they had any influence. Many political parties align on some things that doesnt magically mean the party who mentioned it that one time had any sway in its implementation by another party.
79. yeah, i know, its a sad basis for a council where they see their job to maintain a museum of dilapidated queenslanders.
80. I expect a lot from the LNP, all of it negative sadly.
81. Yeah actually, the way Qld parliament works without an upper house means legislation can be changed overnight by a majority gov. So they can change it overnight on a wim if it's a sitting day. Katter's bring the bill - gov votes and passes it. Nothing more needed. Newman rammed stuff through late night on a few occasions iirc
82. When did I say I did? The newly elected government has said they're not going to build a new stadium for the olympics, but is open to building a new stadium at the Gabba. I know they have likely lied and/or made promises they can't keep. Knowing exactly what a party has promised is important when holding them to account. So if they cut 50 cents fares after a term, that is a broken promise.
83. >any bets a month ago would have said that they were at serious risk of being reduced to a cricket team. I really thought people would wake up and stick with S.Miles I was hoping for a minimum spend on Olympics and minimum lasting impact on the city from the Olympics. DC is going to make a bad situation much worse. I still believe refurbishing an older stadium is better that letting it rot while the DC government gives away Victoria Park to developers to build his Cristafully Stadium and sports entertainment precinct. He really should STOP and realise that he will not be the premier when the Olympics happens, so why waste public money and give away public land to developers just so some other politicians can be there for the shameful glory if it.
84. All parties committed to keeping it. The question is whether they keep their promises.
85. It used to be $10 for myer centre on weekends. If you found a park on the street in the evenings, it is usually less than $10 for a couple of hours or free (after 7 pm in some spots). Two people on the bus from West End was around $15.
86. NORTH LAKES DOESN'T HAVE A TRAIN STATION?! the actual fuck?! No wonder the North Lakes on ramp onto the Bruce is such a nightmare. What idiot approved all those developments without putting in a train line
87. Not sure why you're getting downvoted here, as you're correct. Making the fares cheap doesn't actually increase demand by much, however it is definitely a good cost of living relief measure. Frequency and a good overall network is what drives good patronage. Having all of the above would be wonderful!
