Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. It’s ridiculous. I was fortunate enough to buy my first and only home last year and I don’t care if the value stays flat. It doesn’t benefit me if it increases, because if I sell, most other places have also increased. It benefits investors - who can both liquidate an appreciating asset, and can ask for more in passive rent - and those wanting to refinance.
2. This is the most heartbreaking thing. Knowing that no matter how much you save, you can't save fast enough to keep up with just the increases in deposit required for the ever more expensive homes.
3. It's fucked, we have personally benefited but it's fucked still. There is no way we could buy in the current market. An original single story 1970s styled house just sold for $800k near us. It's ridiculous 😭. Get in with as little deposit as possible don't worry about lenders mortgage insurance.
4. I bought 6 years ago. The appreciation of my house is close to my after tax earnings for the whole time. If I bought today I'd be working an extra 15 years to pay it off. That's how cooked things are.
5. Just get a higher paying job /s - actual quote from Australian politician
6. I've been doing this for years now as well, and a few months ago I went "fuck it" and bought a Japanese Kei truck. I'm a good saver - like what's the point of shovelling it away endlessly if I have no chance of meeting/exceeding the growth in housing? The Kei truck has brought me a significant amount of joy as opposed to the numbers on the screen, which were not.
7. Same boat. It is pretty depressing because I am on a decent salary. We could easily service a mortgage with what we pay in rent and save for a house each month but that initial deposit just keeps going up.
8. Same and with rent going up and up, I don't see what's the point of really trying much anymore though.
9. You need to invest, not save. Real estate is an investment so of course it outpaces money saved in the bank.
10. I bought my house at a "stretch" price for me. Two months later the value went up $50k. At 4 years now, and its doubled in value. After saving for 18 years, I had a 2 month window before I was completely priced out. I got a unicorn property and know how lucky i am. My hear breaks for those who worked ans sacrificed just as hard, if not harder, and are priced out :( brutal out there.
11. > climbing 1.5 per cent in three months to mark a seventh straight quarterly rise. The Queensland capital’s median hit $994,945 So median house price rose $14.7k in 3 months. Assuming 20% deposit you only have to save $1k per month to keep your deposit in pace with this rise. I don't mean to say this is easy for everyone but first home buyers don't (shouldn't) buy median houses so the bar should be lower. Accept a 10% deposit with LMI and the bar is almost halved.
12. Boomer here! In my day we had 18% interest rates.
13. They will bring up the interest rates as they always do.
14. They know. They understand. Anyone claiming that young people should just buck up and get in the market, is actively trying to shit on your life experience. They don't care.
15. So the house price doubles every 10 years but the median wage every 15-20… sucks
16. Biggest issue people have now is serviceability. Even if you saved 20% the bank still isn’t going to lend you the money. You need the $168k deposit and $4178 a month for 30 years! Don’t forget another $25k for Stamp duty and legal and whatever else you need to move in.
17. What you don’t factor in is the change in incomes per household over that time, including that the capacity to save a deposit increases more than linearly with the number of incomes (as many fixed costs like rent are shared between earners).
18. And demand. Very livable city now. Under Joh, hardly a globally accepted paradise. Many want to live here now. Not saying the wages aren't the real issue.
19. It's from reducing investors. If anything the effect on cities like Brisbane is probably exacerbated by the fact that investing in Melbourne attracts taxes that aren't present in Brisbane, and Sydney's too expensive so first time investors there try to buy up shit in other cities... And now they aren't looking at Melbourne either. I just bought a house after a year (actually more, given we tried buying like 3 years ago as well) of just wanting to blow my goddamn brains out not being able to get an offer over the line and I paid nearly twice what the last house sale in this street got in (early) 2021. It's an absolute crime that these family homes that were very attainable for young families just 3 years ago are now out of reach to someone who can't literally offer a million dollars.
20. Melbourne still has a growing population, they’ve just managed their supply better than the other cities which is keeping the prices steady
21. Yeah, most of us Millennials and younger have given up on the dream of ever owning a home.
22. Same. In my 40s on what i believe is a decent wage, but the house prices just remain out of reach. Tbh it makes me feel like a bit of a failure
23. They’ll never admit it too otherwise they would have to admit that they’re wrong which they’re never wrong apparently
24. Every single time I mention high interest rates they just *have* to mention what it was like in the 90s. 15% of $150,000 boo fucking hoo
25. I'm in my mid-40s. I grew up in a village of a third world country where my education was garbage, but even so I was relatively easily able to grow my career and find high paying work; everything was cheap and the prospect of buying a house was a not stressful at all. Had I played my cards right and actually worked a little harder, I could've easily retired by now but took it easy like a dumbass. When I first moved to Australia 8 years ago, to me $300k mortgages were unattainable, but holy smokes, $1m is NUTS. People younger than 30 stand no chance to own a home unless they inherit it, which is my long term
26. I think when you look at the detail it’s not as straightforward as that. Melbourne has a higher proportion of apartments. Melbourne has smaller plots. Melbourne is much bigger so the median house would be further away etc.
27. How’d 50c fares affect the affordability of purchasing or renting?
28. Labor was in power for a decade, but somehow this is the government elected 3 days ago's fault.
29. In this market they could have done nothing and still made close to that amount
30. That crazy for Inala Lakes. But same in Warner on the north side. A couple gone for 1mil this year. Thats Double the price in 6 years for one. Crazy.
31. Absolutely. It's frustrating as fuck, as there doesn't seem to be anyone in politics actually willing to do what is necessary. Another random cunt with lines of investment properties under their belts, looking to spruik the market some more. Allowing super to be used in greater amounts is the next line of bullshit for pumping the market.
32. > I didn’t think be a millionaire would feel so, underwhelming. Because you will not end up with more if you sell and buy another.
33. At the council level, Schrinner has always been in the "line must go up" gang, its why apartments and townhouses have gone up in price so much in the last 5 years, when they should be significantly cheaper than houses.
34. Or maybe they’ll make it easier to develop to accommodate the population growth
35. A four bedroom in Strathfield, the same driving distance in Sydney as Nudgee in Brisbane, will normally go for $3-$5m. $1m is a bargain, especially if you're downsizing or relocating for a different lifestyle. Heck, let's say you're in Blacktown (double the driving distance). Typical sale price is $1-$2m for a four-bedroom house. As long as your career is mobile, you can probably move, be equally well off, and end up with a much nicer lifestyle than living in Blacktown. Brisbane's still cheap compared to Melbourne and Sydney when you compare apples with apples. Melbourne's cheaper if you're happy to live out in the middle of no-where or in an apartment. Which, to be fair, is what Brisbane should be doing - tanking the apartment market by subsidising builders, increasing high-density options from Kangaroo Point to West End, and depressing the average price for an apartment by increasing supply.
36. This. Our property sold to an investment company out of Singapore and I could not believe it was legal. Was arranged sight unseen and now it is being rented out for an obscene price.
37. Can confirm We looked recently and thought this is a bit shit. Small block of land you're looking at 350+ then need a build.on top and all estimates for a basic build are close to 400k
38. yeah that's the way i am going, i don't really have a choice anymore other than pick a house up through inheritance so why stress over saving, enjoy life, leave a smouldering corpse on the way out
39. I wish, at least then I'd have eaten all that sweet smashed avo.
40. For a deposit? We got into a house with $35,000 deposit. Not the size we wanted or exactly the area wanted (Beenleigh) but I feel like people are being super selective then crying that their perfect place isn't at their fingertips.
41. There’s a first home buyer scheme by the feds - 5% deposit for $750k or less purchase. No reason you would have needed to wait until $300k
42. this is a common misunderstanding. it does benefit you massively for when you move to use an extreme to prove the point; say you buy for $100k then when you want to move its worth $1million, but so are other similar houses, you are right that your house appreciation doesnt *seem* to benefit you because others have increased, but even if you didnt pay of any principle, now you can buy a similar place with only a 10% loan, which is hugely beneficial, especially compared to first home buyers who would be lucky to be able to save up 10% deposit
43. It will benefit you long term with the amount of equity you have
44. I did the exact same. When it was clear that any hope of affording a home in our area was long gone, bought a ute. If I can't secure a place for the kids in the neighbourhood they have grown up in, may as well take them on some adventures. Received an almost immediate email from the bank employee I meet with and told her point blank there is no incentive to save for a home so what is the point.
45. My husband’s dream car is a kei truck. How much of a pain is it with maintenance etc in Brisbane?
46. You’ll either end up living in a mansion, or a cardboard box.
47. on 60k houses though... salaries back then were a larger percentage of house prices as well
48. The same figures as above work for this too: “Interest rates were 17%” seems to be what I hear the most from this cohort, so I’ll use that without further research because I’m lazy… Loan on that median 1980 property would be $32,000 odd, so annual interest at 17% is $5,440 or **38% of the median annual income.** Loan on today’s median is $672,000 (as per above and assuming all deposit went to principal - same assumption made for 1980 property). For annual interest let’s just assume you’ve gotten a very competitive 5.5% rate. Some banks are offering this for fixed though I’m sure most people are still at >6%… Anyways, at 5.5% your annual interest is $36,960, or **46% of the median annual income** (thanks for the correction u/tobyobi) I’m aware these are all medians, but it paints a pretty clear picture that it is tougher today than it was 40-odd years ago.
49. Yeah it might be harder to math them on that as you have to explain how loans are so much bigger now in comparison to wages the percentages don't match.
50. Offer to pay them that interest rate, but for the same price of the home as they paid. They can cover the rest if it's not so bad
51. Just tell them that the high interest rates back then were temporary meanwhile highly prices are a permanent problem
52. Yeah, these numbers are based on saving 20% a week of the same single income which is around $300 a week. If your income increases then you could save more and reduce the time it takes to save.
53. It’s pretty bad for apartments too. Bare bones dwellings that were designed purely as affordable living (us poor people living) are now fetching ludicrous prices. I’m in the process at the moment and trying to justify $600k+ for a shit apartment that has been a rental for 30 years and no money spent in it is getting really hard.
54. Mate exactly. Go talk on subs and people will say it’s unrealistic or that you need to save, sacrifice. What was average house price in Brisbane 3, say again, 3 years ago? What 550k-600k? And people have the audacity to have a go at people who are mad or complaining about rising house prices. Even if your a couple both on 150k a year living at home with zero expenses you can’t have kept up. The pollies of both sides have robbed a generation.
55. That blow my brains out line is so relatable. My partner and I are up to what feels like our 50th offer, we have a buyers agent too so doing all the due diligence beforehand to make sure we are offering an attractive price and terms (or at least as much as we can) even pumped our loan up to 800k with extra savings on top and still struggling. Mind you we are looking for a popular area (capalaba) which is on us but trying to cut my partners commute down as I don't think she'll survive an hour each way for much longer.
56. That's why our median dwelling is higher than theirs but their median house and median apartment prices are both higher. But we aren't far behind either of those.
57. Pretty sure half of Melbourne has moved here in the past few years and contributed to these prices...
58. Last I checked, over 50% of Millennials are homeowners now.
59. It’s not even just that owning a home is becoming less of an option, it’s that every 6 months rent is going up $50-$100 a week. How long before people are paying $1000 a week in rent for basic houses? My house has doubled in rent in the 3.5 years I’ve lived here. Not going to be long before one whole pay check is going to rent, and your partners pay check has to cover….everything else, and no savings.
60. It got to 19%. Imagine paying credit card interest on 4 times your salary. It actually is worse than 6% on 10 times your salary. Default rates were massive, people were walking into the bank and throwing their keys at bank managers. Marriages broke down and people were losing their house everywhere. It broke many people. Trying to dismiss it as bro $150K sign me up for 5 shows how much you really don't understand how hard it was. Way less people are defaulting on their mortgages today than back then. Things are fucked today but trying to dismiss the early 90s as not as bad is just plain wrong.
61. One of the biggest issues in Brisbane is height restrictions, because successive conservative councils want to "Keep that quiet suburban feel" in suburbs right next to the city. We're currently undergoing a review in Stones Corner, and my biggest issue is that their plan doesn't expand height limits anywhere but the places that already have expanded height limits. So the 8 storeys can go to 20 storeys, but the block on the other side of the street is still limited to 3.
62. The median plot isn’t actually further away in Melbourne; Brisbanes metro is the largest and most dispersed in the country. Of course you’re right about all the other things but everything comes with trade offs, and importantly Melbourne does have higher wages and far more career opportunities in technical industries. In aggregate, when considering the overall level of urban amenities and income opportunities in Melbourne it’s really hard to say Brisbane is more affordable.
63. Those are one of the main reasons why Melbourne is more affordable relative to Brisbane than it used to be. Maybe we should be doing what they're doing.
64. this is true, even 45m out of Melbourne, you're still in Melbourne, but 30 mins out of Brisbane and you're in Ipswich and 45 and you're on the gold coast.
65. Appreciate the kind words, it’s actually scary how bad some of the stuff in Brisbane was. Visible mould, filthy carpets, water leaks, yellowed walls and blinds, we even inspected a surprising amount of houses that had holes in the walls caused by the previous tenants - and these places are still listed for $700k+ with people actually inspecting them. There were a handful of nice places around strathpine area but they get snapped up so quickly. I worry how our children are ever going to afford a house. I feel like Brisbane is headed the same direction that Sydney was pre-covid, at some point people are going to have to move out to Warwick, Gympie etc and just stomach the commute. Crazy.
66. This is a point I’ve been trying to make too Like how do you think Queensland got in this situation? Must be the LNPs fault
67. As a prospective buyer, I would have preferred they did nothing. The spray job was shit and everything was covered in overspray. The fad of a bunnings renovation needs to die as 9 times out of 10 it's just lipstick on a pig.
68. That approach does not work. Why? You are relying on for profit companies to make a decision to invest in a new build. Any policy that requires for profit companies to invest in building is not going to solve the housing crisis, and that goes for Labor's policies that use them as well. They can help, but can't be the majority of the solution. Because for profit companies will only build if they think they can make a profit. In order for us to bring housing costs to income ratios back to a reasonable level, we will need a surplus of homes available on the market. That is what is required for housing prices to drop. But no for profit company is going to build houses in a market where prices are dropping, or even where the market is very slow in turnover. They need and want demand to stay high so that their profits keep rising. What that means is that they will slow their building when prices are dropping, and only restart in numbers when prices are rising again. At the VERY best you might be able to keep up with population growth with a for profit developer approach and slow down the increases in costs, but they will still keep going up.
69. Your electorate is mostly low density residential or even lower density than low density, and only like 8kms from the cbd, do you think the state government is going to take back planning controls from council and change that?
70. You're both talking shit. This problem has arisen under both major parties watch and both are equally to blame
71. Humans were at one point in history nomads. I used my house deposit to live in an RV. Life living in cars is worth it.
72. Maybe use your savings to start a smashed avo food truck so you can drive around and prey on other millennials. They can’t resist.
73. How many bootstraps have you been pulling up? Maybe you need to get a second job doing that
74. This is funny until it’s no longer funny. I feel like in order for us to deal with the dire state of housing prices, we just cop it on the chin and make sarcastic jokes to cope. It’s funny, but I feel like I can no longer laugh about it. There is absolutely no way a person can rent and save for a future home, and I say a home not a house, because that’s what they are meant to be and should be a human right to be affordable to the average Australian who does the right things. You could rent + eat rice all day, every day, and live in darkness, reading books for entertainment & leisure and you’ll still never afford a home unless you have a partner and are taking in a whopping $200k+
75. Don't know why you are being down voted. I agree with you. (Fellow beenleigh here :) )
76. I’m sorry if my comment was confusing. I never meant we had to save 300k, I said the goal for purchasing a house in our area was $300k.
77. Edited, because I think you’re right: Let’s be more realistic with the example. $800k house, paid 20% (160k), didn’t pay off principal and want to move after 10 years. Now worth $1.3M. I sell. Bank takes $640k. I get $660k. I now have $660k to work with as a 20% deposit, however my ability to service the remainder of loan is pretty much the same, so I would be eligible for a slightly higher loan. *If I did keep the old house to use it as equity, I would fall into the bucket of investor, as I had mentioned previously it benefits.*
78. It also represents systemic risk, so there's that. Price rises like this are not healthy for an economy long term, or society at large.
79. For most people it's not nearly as important as having a place to live in.
80. I did the first service on it at 1000km which was basically just an oil change. Most of the basic stuff (oil and other filters) are interchangeable with domestically available cars and there are some outlets selling parts (Just Jap online and Davey Motor Group in Victoria). Even Amazon ships Japanese domestic market OEM Daihatsu parts like shocks and other bits. Tl;dr: I don't think it'll be too bad in the long run. Hardest part is translating the Japanese service manual
81. Unless these schemes and their maximum price cap are lifted to reflect Brisbane's actual costs, they are total bullshit.
82. And 17% was variable and not for the whole 30 years. If you didn't manage to get a capped home loan (with a fixed ceiling but variable under that) like some did at 13.5%. It's a supply crunch and a demand spike at the same time. The crunch I get because of chronic underinvestment and inflationary pressures; where is the money coming to inflate house prices though? Is it all the quantitative easing money that was stashed coming out to play? If so, why aren't they trickling it out to get better deals?
83. Based on your median wage of $80,000, interest is only 46%, not 108%. (It’s still not good).
84. Lol what? Are you saying two people on 150k each living at home can't buy a place? Brudda come on
85. Your example is outlandish. I’m single, rent and earned 176k in FY22/23, 260k in FY23/24. I earn less than your example, pay more tax, and have more outgoings (rent). And still easily managed to save a deposit and buy a place.
86. What's insane is, as someone who grew up in the Redlands, Capalaba was never a good option for commuting until recently when shit hit the fan. It is absolutely crazy to me that a suburb where house prices were dirt cheap even 10 years ago can fetch such a high asking price now. For reference: parents bought a bush acerage in the ass end of capalaba in 2014 for $650K, and just had it valued at 2.2mil. That is fucking INSANE.
87. I want to say mate, I *completely understand*. And I know that no-one in your life right now really gets it. At best they'll be a bit sympathetic but if they aren't out there trying for themselves, they have absolutely no clue the constant mental anguish and repeatedly ruined weekends you're experiencing, honestly through *no fault of your own*. My partner once tried explaining it to a friend and her partner at dinner one night. His response was 'Yeah that sucks, but I guess at some point you've just gotta bite the bullet hey?' She's like 'What bullet do you think we aren't biting?' 🤨 By that point we'd even had at least 2 offers in that were higher than what the eventual sale price was, but lost out due to wanting a building and pest inspection or something like that. I like the guy but I've never wanted to punch someone in the face more after hearing that lol. But he just didn't comprehend what the situation was.
