Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. People are getting stabbed and their houses broken into with weapons just to steal car keys. You also assume everyone is insured for theft and ignoring the fact you will pay the excess if they don't catch them and then insurance rates for the region increase. I'm sure you're one of the people crying about cost of living already
2. Do you think that property being insured somehow makes theft or damage OK?
3. One problem we have with the way we currently see politics is we assume everyone has the same level of engagement as we do. In reality, most people don't dig as deep into policies and just form their views on headlines. If there is a groundswell against the LNP because the reef is being destroyed, that will entrench a generation of Labor voters along the coast who care about environmental protection. It doesn't help to assert they're all Neanderthals. They're real people with dynamic opinions and views. Their perception of crime is a real thing and they felt like they weren't being heard by Labor. What we need to do now is hammer the LNP and do letterbox drops every single month collating all the shitfuckery they do
4. Yeah, all those redneck indigenous voters in Traeger who turned out for KAP, or those white supremacists in Cook who gave the popular vote to a traditional owner from Yam Island.
5. So fair dude. But if it wasn't this term, it would have been next. Labor was facing down so much bs from the media it was wild they managed to save as many seats as they did. It isn't a good thing medium term. Long term, it is a good thing.
6. Nope, of course she hasn’t taken public transport in years. I said people really need that extra money and she said rich people get transport too, they can afford more. Like, pretty sure more poor people get the train than rich. And even so, if it means less cars on the road the rich can have the 50 cent fare.
7. >How do you know it was youths that robbed them? Seen on security cameras, shared on social media and [reported by Queensland Police](https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/news/2024/08/28/property-crime-arrests-goondiwindi-and-toowoomba/) >Do you have many other examples from your town? How many do you want? [Here's another](https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/news/2024/08/17/property-crime-offences-goondiwindi/). You can even watch the [security footage](https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=580213257852709&id=100075921190099) posted by residents. >Are you not worried that the media influenced your attitudes to create your fear of noises in the night? I don't read the Courier Mail mate. There's plenty of [victims](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-03-09/goondiwindi-crime-forum-residents-living-in-fear/102068948) without needing the media to influence anything.
8. >"you can't say that about voters" just misses the point entirely in that we have voted out a government that was in the process of repairing the state You're not listening mate. I'm not the one that needs convincing, it's my neighbours. They voted for a change in the status quo because they were sick of waking up in the middle of the night to noises thinking it was their turn to get broken into. No one is safe - the elderly, children, security system or not they don't discriminate they come and take what they want. When youth crime [is running riot](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.abc.net.au/article/102068948) in your town, you don't care about anything else but the safety of your family. Labor wasn't listening and refused to put things in place for *years*. Walk in the shoes of my neighbours - when you take every step to protect your family short of using firearms, why in the world would you vote for a government that isn't listening to you? I want to see Labor get back in again. But until Labor admits they dropped the ball in regional and rural communities by not doing enough on youth crime, Labor will not recover enough votes lost outside Brisbane to form a government in the future.
9. Not just lock up but spent a couple grand on a security system and cameras. Still doesn't deter them.
10. This right here. Every time I see someone whinging about a stolen car on the local groups, the question “was it locked?” is always followed by crickets.
11. Yes they do. Kids use multi grips to damage doors knows. Other times they kick them straight of the hinges.
12. I didn't however a quick scan of population growth in FNQ shows that the population has grown 4.2% or 11,851 people (I dont know the breakdown of young people and adults) since 2019. So while population has grown the increase in offences is above and beyond population growth. I don't think an extra ~2000 kids would be doing the extra 40% property offences. Also note, I haven't done population growth in other areas but I am assuming they would be similar or at least close to FNQ. However, with crime, even with population growth I would think the goal would be to still lower the offences rate or at the very least maintain it irrespective of population growth.
13. Are those things you mentioned part of the policies announced, or you just making it up? If you read the actual policy regarding youth crime you may actually be surprised. But that is not my point, the point is all the people in here saying youth crime isn't an issue and repeat a headline stat with no critical research themselves, clearly don't know the actual stats, particularly in regional QLD where Labor lost the election.
14. No, the problem is labor is out of touch, patronizing, its supporters are classic leftists who instead of examining where they failed, resort to calling all non labor voters stupid. The reality is half the states population lives outside SEQ and our experience is different. Trying to gaslight us oh but crime is going down!! When it’s steadily gone up the years labor have been in power especially in regional areas where it is out of control. Instead of listening to voters labor stooges patronized and belittled them. So this is what you get.
15. Or, those that voted for then don't believe it's the wrong choice for them like you do. That you're so adamant you're right and they're wrong shows breathtaking arrogance. Calling them a waste of space for having a different opinion to yours is also terribly immature. LNP won, Labor lost, and the Greens were annihilated. Which means your opinion is in the minority no matter how loudly you shout it. Instead of whinging to the leftist echo chambers of Reddit, if you're really that passionate, you could actually get involved in politics. But if your arguments continue not to stack up with the electorate, I'd hope you learn a bit more humility and stop insulting people simple for daring to disagree with you.
16. I'll be back fact checking any rubbish. Remindme!in 2 year
17. No l didn’t. But there’s a long way to go to reverse it. Look at FNQEB out Electricity Board up here - still Govt owned, changed its name, bought an abn, now it’s for profit!!
18. Thank you. It failed spectacularly last time, yet cresafool insists on flogging that dead horse to cut costs to cover their inevitable blow outs somewhere else
19. They both do nothing about the housing crisis, They both do nothing about all the huge companies paying no tax, especially the mining companies. They both flood the country with legal immigration making housing, healthcare etc worse. Just so they can say the economy's growing. They're both America's b**** and do whatever they say. There is dozens of examples but I can't be f***** listing then all. Yes labor stuffs around the edges a bit but ultimately achieves nothing on purpose.
20. Lol. Pls. Any surplus simply means the ALP/LNP uniparty is taking too much of other people's money (i.e. tax).
21. It's worse than sweeping it under the rug, it's creating an even bigger problem. !remindme for 12 years from now when the LNP run their next election charge on the adult crime crisis perpetrated entirely by kids they threw in jail
22. Good luck to you mate, sad to see what has become of this state. I'm seriously weighing up leaving too, as this isn't my home state and I'm not keen to see what happens.
23. I feel bad for them too. They have to put up with losers like you.
24. I'd say a lot of people would. If you want to be ruled like you're a peasant then feel free to vote that way. I'd say you're probably pretty good at being walked over.
25. Feel free to point out where I blamed the results on a political ideology and not just brain-dead pawns.
26. Well letting a baby die in Ballina just because their family can't vote for her while letting NRL players play in front of mass gatherings without two weeks quarantine isn't exactly left wing now is it?
27. I have both actually and they seem pretty happy as they all voted the same way.
28. Life will go on as normal, everyone that doesn’t live on Reddit will go to work tomorrow and forget there was an election. Subreddits create their own hype and the users don’t even realise it, then the world ends when other people think differently.
29. when the boys repeal compulsory preferential voting you’ll be even more impressed with the power of our vote🤣. Go grab another covid booster.
30. Yea I’ve never understood the opposition. Who knew that you could cause so much damage by *checks notes* changing an M to an F on some forms Scary stuff lol
31. It removes our meaningful language and sex-based rights. It gives males the right to gain access to women's sports, prisons, changing rooms. etc. That's why there is opposition.
32. crime in 2023 was the highest since 2011 and 2024 still has 3 months to go.
33. And what of the campaign that Labor ran? It was pathetic and Miles maintained it right to the end with his atrocious speech. Today we still walk the same paths, and drive the same congested roads. The water at the beach will still be salty and so will the Labor voters.
34. Not what was said at all you dolt. You cunts having a sook because someone else got voted in and are looking to blame blame blame. It's all Murdoch this and that. Murdoch been around for how long? He didn't stop them being in the top job for near 10 years. Hasn't stopped Labor having the top job of the country and just about every state. What's changed? The majority stopped believing in Labor and voted a different way
35. Have you actually read the reports where these statistics are, or just parroting the headline you see on Facebook?
36. Ok champ, go ahead and keep crying about it on Reddit, that's how you really make change happen
37. lol so why didn’t labor run a campaign with all these statistics posted on Reddit about whole crime was going down? Saw all the labor stooges like the smug Mr jordies yapping about it and when you examine the stats it shows a steady increase for years of labor government with a downward trend only last year or two, still way higher then before labor was in power. If you actually looked at the stats it showed over labor tenure crime increased a lot…that’s why they didn’t talk about it. Labor stooges trying to gaslight everyone
38. Labor is not even left wing, they aren’t anti capitalist, they have nothing to do with actual leftism, you’re just smug capitalist liberals and neoliberals who are out of touch and disconnected from the working class
39. I wonder what else the money that was used as a vote sweetener could be used for...?
40. Debt is no good if it keeps getting bigger. Thats like having a credit card that you never pay off. Eventually you go bankrupt. And thats what our future holds if its not reversed.
41. Oh i dont know, infrastructure? Put some more in QIC? Isn’t there an Olympics we need to build for? How about housing or something? Long-term investments for the State. Do you also spend every dollar you get come bonus time? And all of this could’ve been done earlier than the 6 months into an election too.
42. i’m just waiting for the Tesla to charge and then i’ll head off to Burketown to catch up with my mob.
43. they can use their 50c fares to drive to the daintree though. Or walk the creb
44. That's the way democracy goes. You will have a long painful life if you emotionally drain yourself over an election result. You can cry media as much as you want, but it is disgusting the fact the majority of Queenslanders simply have a different view as to who is best placed to lead the state. Casually observing from Melbourne, Miles looked like a right moron.
45. Well, that is rude and just proven once again that the left is not as tolerant and loving as they say they are. Thank you :)
46. Fucking hilarious. Have a Bex and a good lie down, the world is still turning.
47. Oh I dont disagree with them, they are good, its why I voted ALP. But there just icing without the cake
48. In your opinion it would be better , and as was proven yesterday your opinion is the less popular one but it can’t possibly be that you might be wrong right ? It has to be , just simply has to be that everyone else is too stupid right ? That’s exactly what you are claiming in this post
49. This is the coal that they're banning the use of? So not long term sustainable funding, just the usual magic money tree
50. " All voices are NOT equal." In a Democracy they ARE . Incredibly worrying to hear so called "progressive" people argue otherwise.
51. Something common in all those states …. LABOR LABOR have cut so much in Victoria
52. It’s clear that comment was made in sarcasm… maybe read it a second time and you might get it.
53. read that comment again , they were complementing you. typical sensistive australians.
54. That's one way to tell everybody you didn't make it beyond the first paragraph.
55. Oh wow, thanks for the clarification genius, and I guess that means people who don’t pay power bills don’t get ambulance cover, and have to pay another surcharge… no?!? Oh, that’s right, a levy is attached to power bills that gives EVERYONE ambulance cover. This is like saying public roads aren’t free to use, because you pay registration. You really are a clown if you can’t work out what “free ambulance cover” means in Queensland.
56. Ambulance *used* to be on the power bill. It is now an emergency management levy incorporated into rates and covers Ambulance, fire and police.
57. They don’t mind if government costs to punish people, they hate it when the government costs to help people. They’d rather pay for police and prison than prevention and intervention.
58. Give them the wrong meds and help us all out. I'm sorry a generation who huffed lead paint is in Change of my childrens future
59. Sounds like the other boomers are far more sensible and well travelled than you, you would be wise to listen to those amongst you and do some independent study yourself into nuclear power. My father was a nuclear physicist and I can tell you nuclear is the only safe and sustainable solution for our country long term
60. What if the side effects ended up being worse than covid though? They werent, thank fuck. But you literally had no way of knowing that. Forcing people to take something that they literally did not know what it was going to do is still absolutely insane to me. You absolutely are a coward if you took an experimental, untested drug, purely because a government we all agree is corrupt, brainwashed you into thinking you are hero for doing so. The mental gymnastics to call other people a coward, when you took the option that both the government and the average person all said you should take lmfao. Bravo Captain Australia you really showed alot of bravery and stood up to adversity. Also have you kept up with every single booster ever since taking it? Because covid has gone nowhere, its as widespread as it ever was, and barely anyone is still immunised against it. It cant have been THAT big of a deal if everything is completely fine now yet transmission levels are identical to what they were at the peak of lockdowns and mass panic. I got the jab too, because it was either that or lose my job and become homeless and eventually kill myself because of it. But Ill never agree with forcing it on people, or else they lose their entire livelihood, being the right thing to do.
61. They totally are, can’t you see they managed to put the country in debt by nearly a trillion dollars.
62. Inflation only happens under Labor Labor came in federally and have screwed the country
63. I mean really $50 to $100 every 6 months? I get the public transport cost helping those without their own transport but I think theres a lot bigger issues than the small amount for vehicle owners.
64. $150,000 is the cost for adults in detention. The annual cost for juvenile detention is over $760,000 each
65. You could get some pretty sweet lunches to encourage kids to stay in school for that money… feeding and sheltering kids in need might even keep them out of jail… oh well, guess we’ll never know.
66. i read on the brisbane sub that he was going to cut the drug safety programs at schoolies this year.
67. The main tagline is “adult time adult crime” not “prevention is better than punishment. They put more jail time at the forefront of the policy not me
68. I wouldn't bother mate, you're not dealing with rational people.
69. 'We will' becomes we won't. Obviously the media will be scrutinising their election promises closely. /s
70. Labor voters aren't the best at research. If the abc, guardian etc don't spruke it, it must be misinformation.
71. Pretty much all of this is focused on AFTER the offence has been committed. What are they going to do about the sorts of factors that lead to kids committing crimes?
72. Amazing how they can do all that at the same time as cutting funding to the bone, isn't it?
73. Their policy on being tough on crime is incredibly general, nor does it describe how they will address the issue. They want to enhance putative measures. Yet, it is clear that enhanced education outcomes is the best protective variable. So it stands to reason that any initiative that keeps kids in school and adequately performing, whilst being sensitive to issues impacting performance, is our best offensive and defensive plan. Thus, their plans go against the accumulated evidence in all western countries, including ours. It is not evidence-based and is entirely concerned with problem-focused immediate response, rather than solution-focused and longitudinally framed; enhancing the potential for cascading negative effects for individuals and society 20 years down the track. For example, they say they want to prevent future crime by identifying at-risk youth for a life of criminal conduct (we literally cannot even do that and even more importantly, being born as non-white will indirectly increase your risk automatically on most measures available for risk assessment), and then make them attend camps/programs to address this. However, all the accumulated evidence suggests that most people naturally commit some crime and it naturally desists by 25yrs. It also suggests that placing kids in contact with police and other systems increases their risk of further contact. They oppose some important incremental population-level initiatives (saliently the free-lunch scheme) that keeps disadvantaged kids performing (thus also less cranky) in school, which inherently reduces both youth-limited and life-long criminal conduct. When I say this, I am referring to the systhesis of robust evidence coming from Terri Moffit's typologies of developmental pathways to antisocial conduct, and population-level initiatives such as social and emotional learning programs (E.g., see meta-analysis by Durlak et al., 2011). On a last point, this is not even considering the fact that when you put kids who are... As you might say, displaying antisocial behaviour together—like in prison or in special education programs—behaviour gets worse. Again, keeping them in school with those who are doing satisfactorily is the best defence. Also this doesn't even consider major differences between ethno-cultural subgroups as well as dominant white culture. The issue is very complex and embedded in geographical issues, socio-historical injustice, and ongoing discrimination experiences. The answer again based on the evidence is to keep them in school and out of the prison system. I'm concerned that these laws will inflate the issues because what constitutes as adult crime will not be clear. What constitutes breaking and entering—the most common method of car theft is simply entering through unlocked doors. *Edited to repost a comment I made on another post which outlines some of the reasons why the policies are based in talking points, not evidence, and have the potential for damaging consequences.
74. These policies focus on rehabilitation rather than prevention. While these initiatives are good, sticking a bandaid on the cuts isn't going to make the blade go away. Labour's free lunch program would be a more effective approach to reducing youth crime. Children who aren't hungry are better able to learn and stay engaged in school. We've all experienced how difficult it is to focus or work while hungry. When children have full bellies, their engagement in school is stronger, leading to less youth crime. Statistically, reports have shown that free lunches directly provides: \- 17% reduced suspensions (in minorities) \- Average higher grades (mostly in Math) [\[source\]](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/schoolwide-free-meal-programs-fuel-better-classroom-outcomes-for-students/) Theres a good number of other studies, but I really can't be bothered.
75. I am opposed to you in every way, which I hate to have as an opening statement. I know you are trying, but the implementation of such things is impossible. Giving kids school lunches means they have to be at school to get them. Who is going to enforce this nonsense? It's great if your kids are fine upstanding citizens (like all mine are, farque) but delinquent kids come from delinquent parents. You can lead a horse to water, but it will still eat your cheeks when hungry. Or something.
76. Bruh, I work in resi homes. Dual carers is going to do fuck all 🤣 but good luck finding the staff to work in them anyway.
77. In going to double down here. Who is enforcing this regulated system. It's fecking great if your kids just want to go to the library anyway (or play video games), but if they are huffing some brain drain nonsense, mum and dad won't talk, grandma is the only one who makes them sandwiches and onlyfans seems like an easy solution you got bigger problems
78. Triple tap. Some kids are just munted. They need to be away from their ghoulish parents.
79. I don't believe anything that comes from Newman mach 2
80. By definition, bloomers are born between 1946 - 1964, so the youngest is 60. Perhaps I'm being defensive because I'm mid 50s and definitely do not consider myself a boomer...
81. Weird how boomers are so educated, but they get their cars stolen by children. Amazed they haven't looked at a better way to just secure their car. I got a big ass dog, my rule is, if you get past the dog you can take what you want, you've earned it
82. According to National Seniors Australia, one third of voters in QLD are over 60, which is pretty nuts. No wonder QLD leans conservative.
83. Ah, but we can give them three square in jail... loophole
84. The same amount as now? Had my house broken into and cars stolen when the Newman government was in…didn’t go off crying about it, or blaming the government…thinking privatizing prisons and locking up 10 year olds will fix anything is nothing short of ridiculous though
85. I mean do they though? Sure, [news.com.au](http://news.com.au) is the most read Murdoch site but it's also relatively non-ideological, compared to the curious snail or the \`strayan.
86. I have lived in Tasmania. I love it and may move back there shortly. Libs improved it dramatically.
87. Actually, I'm not affiliated with the LNP at all, or any other party. I vote purely for whomever will best serve my interests. Also I support women's rights to abortion. I do not support the climate lunacy that is priortizing spending on something that is inevitable over cost of living and quality of life. Looks like I touched a nerve though.
88. How much you wanna bet a fair portion of them were just a couple years ago "doing their own research" on mRNA vaccines and 5G...
89. Yup. This. It's so hard to get someone out of the murdoch cult once they get in it.
90. I at least take comfort in there being savvy folks and in no small number. Unfortunately that number is likely still a minority. The average person walking down the street is really not that smart...
91. I would absolutely put money on it not happening. They know they’re on thin ice and have been given a bit of rope. They might tinker with mining royalties and other taxes, but it would be political suicide to criminalise abortion. They know that, and won’t do it.
