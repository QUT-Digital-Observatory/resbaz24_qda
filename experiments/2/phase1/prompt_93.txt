Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. I have spent many years working in Emergency Departments and the ramping issue is many layered and complex. The first issue is that ED is a funnel , building bigger EDs' does not fix the problem, its like making the mouth of the funnel wider whilst the spout remains the same size. What is actually needed is more medical / surgical beds in the wards, better post discharge services such as Hospital in the Home. Additionally, more aged care beds are required as patients awaiting aged care placement take up acute beds while waiting for a position to become available in the age care system. Colocating bulk billing 16 hour GP services within a reasonable proximity of EDs' would allow for non urgent cases to be moved through a GP clinic and free up ED beds for those people needing the higher level of care. Many approaches have been tried over the years and have not been successful as they potentially could have been due to Q Health and the Government of the day ( both parties) not providing ongoing funding or not providing adequate staff and dooming the projects to failure. For example an ED opened in Qld . The new department was twice the size of the old department however it was not funded for additional staff and ran with the same number of staff as had previously been in the old department. Consequently, although the public saw a new massive department and had an expectation that the waiting times would be less. In reality it was just a shiny new box with the same old insides. A large number of cases also come in from aged care for routine issues that should of been handled at an aged care facility but as many aged care facilities only employ a single registered nurse , often very junior and inexperienced they have inadequate resources to deal with patients who may been easily managed had the facility had more adequate resources. Apart form filling an ED bed with a patient who needed relatively minor interventions but must occupy a bed either through comorbidities or because of altered mental states (dementia etc) they usually require QAS transport to and from the nursing home thus removing an ambulance form the available pool to respond to the wider general public. Capital investment in infrastructure needs to be sped up to meet the increasing demand for services, for example the new Bundaberg Hospital will open in 2027 providing it opens on schedule but is likely to be over time and over budget . The planning and contract negotiations for this hospital started in 2017/ 2018 so from initial design to opening will be around a decade and if it comes in on budget about 1.2 billion dollars I understand that people want world class medical care and they should have it but there is a limit as to what can be provided with current budgets. So many people complain when they are asked to contribute more to support the system and it is understandable that with spiraling cost it is a difficult ask but without adequate budgets and capital works investment the public healthcare sector will continue to fail.
2. Satellite hospitals are a great thing to have around. My mother had to take my sister into the one at Ripley after she'd been off for a few days and only mentioned a head knock to her after a few days worth of symptoms. Took her into the Ripley satellite hospital, in and out within 2 hours, excellent care, and got what she needed from it. Doctor figured it was post concussion syndrome and sent her off with what she needed, plus it saved a bunch of time that wouldn't been wasted waiting in the ED of a bigger hospital.
3. Can't run a hospital like it's a fucking drive through window with nurses and doctors under even more pressure to get wait times down. Not everything needs to be treated like a business.
4. This is a horrific idea. Do they even consult medical professionals for these rogue plans?
5. The LNP don’t “ get “ anything about the public health system. If they thought they could get away with dismantling it they would.
6. I agree. The ED is something you either need or you don't. It's not a wait dependent thing. If it is, go to an urgent care or see a GP or dial a doctor.
7. It's a moronic idea that won't change anything - if my experience from ambulance (including clinical opcen work) is anything to go by, it's still unlikely to influence decisions to go (especially from inappropriate users who literally don't care). It'll just dissuade people who probably need to be there from seeking help. The bandaid is to expand the hospitals - more beds to fix bed block to allow EDs to cycle patients more quickly. We also need to accept that telehealth can only go so far, and sometimes we just need to assess people in-person. That means having capacity to do so. That said - the satellite hospitals need to be reworked. They're *not hospitals* and should never have been called hospitals. They're Minor Injury and Illness Clinics. As a paramedic I find them somewhat frustrating because it's sometimes hard to refer patients here with apparently arbitrary refusals (one day x is fine - the next it isn't). They should be utilised much more and we should have better guidance on what can be *reliably referred*. The actual *fix* though - people need to get used to getting the care they *need* and not necessarily what they *want*. That's a big attitude shift that we're going to have to push, because as much as throwing extra beds helps for a bit, it quickly becomes overwhelmed. There's an entire set of systemic failures at multiple points putting pressure on EDs and wards - and things like nursing homes/CAREPACT and RADAR, GP clinics/bulk billing issues, hospital@home programs, and paramedic referral pathways need to evolve to reduce presentations where possible.
8. The NHS in the UK publishes this information live - E.g. https://aeinfo.nhs.wales/
9. Just a reminder to people on here that QLD health also has a Virtual Emergency Department where you can speak to Emergency Nurses and Doctors for minor (and some more complex issues). They can organize pathology, Xrays, CT's etc and provide followup for all testing. It's a great service with good wait times (and even if you are waiting a bit, wouldn't you rather do it at home?) And if they think you need to be seen in a physical ED they will refer you to one. Advertising wait times in ED'S won't fix any of the problems we have in healthcare atm.
10. This is CLASSIC LNP blaming frontline staff and hospitals for a system that could probably be doubled and still not meet needs of the community This is how they started last time , then they slashed healthcare to absolutely fucking dangerous levels
11. These cunts really do not have any good ideas. This is what I was saying to my husband, the Abortion stance is already bad enough, but we're also not paying enough attention to their other terrible ideas.
12. People already self-triage now. I calculate wait times in my head before deciding to ride it out or wait 8-12 hours to get care. My husband took my daughter to a local for whooping cough symptoms and turned back for home when he saw the wait lines. Infantilising people by hiding numbers isn’t going to change that. And it’s worse trying to see a Dr by appointment.
13. So it's about putting pressure on the existing staff and not expanding the services to meet. I can already hear supposed Health Minister Ros Bates screeching "your simply not hitting your kpi's!". When will people realised that not only do the LNP not care they are such a shallow pool of real world experience they haven't a bloody clue.
14. I get how this can turn dangerous, but in fairness, I have called ahead at the ED to ask “is it super busy” - because sometimes it’s worth copping the private ED fee to avoid a wait (and it takes strain off the public one too).
15. I can't say how this would impact, all I know is last time we had an LNP government I was in and out of the ED in less time that I have since had to wait to have my children seen for very similar, sometimes worse things. I've also had a the ED door bitch basically tell me to f\*\*\* off and intimate that I was a drug addict seeking medication for wanting to have a broken bone assessed. And there are other things that I don't really want to share either. But I'm open to anything that changes the way EDs operate, because at the moment they're failing hard (and that is not a reflection of the work of the individuals my child or I have been treated by, once you see someone they're usually very good).
16. Took my son to the ED last night. He stacked it on the scooter. A few cuts and bruises but his arm appeared to be fractured. They took him in immediately. I’ve also been to that same ED and waited 4 hours for a crazy deep cut on my arm that needed stitches… happened at night or I’d have gone elsewhere and I didn’t complain once. This is ridiculous
17. As others have said, this is useless because of the triage system emergency rooms rightly have. Qld Health actually leads the world in the public reporting of hospital information that matters (google inform my care), including for private hospitals. This is at risk if the LNP are elected & bow to their private health donors.
18. The 13 health is terrible for the most part, they aren’t actually independently triaging, they are asking the exact same questions on the website. They do have these wait times in the US, of course in cities that just means you may choose one hospital over another. Realistically, no ED is ever big enough or well staffed enough for the current population as it was built for a as population based decades ago.
19. > The LNP will also cut new satellite hospitals that are desperately needed to offload the minor injuries and illnesses. 100,000 people utilised these hospitals in a year so that's 100,000 less ED presentations. Where does this information come from? [The LNP](https://online.lnp.org.au/news/three-phase-plan-to-heal-labors-health-crisis) have advised as recently as 7 October that (highlighting just the reference to Satellite Hospitals) > Cure ($448.18 million of additional funding, not including the existing hospital build funding or additional clinicians) > * More CT and MRI machines: an extra 9 CT and 6 MRI machines, to free-up hospital beds and bolster ‘satellite hospital’ and regional hospital services. > “Queensland’s ‘satellite hospitals’ will be bolstered with additional CT and MRI services for referred patients available 7 days a week, taking critical pressure off our struggling emergency departments. They will also be appropriately renamed in consultation with medical experts.”
20. Another Labor staffer posting to save their job. Sick of this sht. I'm voting LNP because of your post now.
21. Nah the witchdoctors need to get off their high horses and accept transparent accountability.
22. Any concerns around the risk of self-triage can be managed with community public health education programs. They are already been used for a number of other initiatives, such as the satellite hospitals and how to choose whether to go to your GP, satellite hospital/urgent care, or hospital emergency. People aren't idiots, they can be educated around the information available to them. The argument you raise actually undermines the use of satellite urgent care centres because they too are dependent on some self-triaging to determine whether to go there or hospital emergency. I just don't get what the difference is. Give people the benefit of the doubt to be able to adapt and make decisions in their best interest. I think most people understand how triaging works at its most basic level - its not first come first served so wait times will be a guide only.
23. Right? What wait time are they reporting - the longest? The average? If so, which average? One of those ideas that sounds good until you consider literally everything about it. If it's about transparency then weekly or monthly reporting is just fine. If it's about the illusion of "choice" then I'd remind the LNP that going to the emergency department isn't a choice, and if too many patients are turning up of a weekend maybe they should be asking their friends in the highly privatised GP sector why that is.
24. I'd prefer if they added an additional level of triage to reduce wait times. -'go away this is not an injury that needs to be seen at a hospital- make a doctors appointment, put a bandaid on it or get your mum to kiss it better' The wait time is automatically indefinite and you never get seen
25. The only potential good that it could serve, is making people come up and complain if they have been their longer than the time posted. And the reason that would be good is, if you wlare well enough to complain, you can probably be pushed down the list to make way for people sicker.
26. And damn it works well in my experience! I walked into ED a couple of months ago. I knew I was unwell, hence going in the first place, but thought hey I’m probably not *that* unwell, I’m in for a couple of hour wait here, but it’s better than dying at home. Triage nurse looked almost visibly shocked at my state, and pulled me straight in to be seen and I ended up being admitted very quickly. Honestly had I had the ability to check wait times, I may have thought about wallowing in bed a bit longer like I had for the previous 3 days.
27. I have done consulting for government when I did consulting. I only took on gigs where multiple agencies and groups had already tried to resolve a problem/come up with a solution and didn't - I was a terrible consultant because I did not stretch out engagements I just got in and took exactly as long as it took and was done. Technology in government and a lot of consultancy for government is beyond awful, wilfully awful. It does not attract the best people, there are ample amounts of waste and empire building. No shortage of 'everyone else is stupid and I'm a rockstar' mentality. I saw every stereotype that people hate about IT people being proudly displayed. I spoke to my local member about this last week who was doing the campaigning thing. Spoke about my experience with government as a subject matter expert on some things in technology and how you get treated with the same expertise as an individual. Highlighted technology things and advisory to government and explained exactly how it was beyond stupid. Helped I was able to pull out previous examples of gov advisory panel advised $30m to do something, I advised them that they were completely incorrect and it was less than $1m - relates to asset management I could go into it but this is enough detail. This stuff has been consistent across governments too it is a structural issue made worse by the fact that technology recruiting is a dumpster fire akin to 'what if real estate agents did not require a license'. Earlier this week there was the thing I learnt through this subreddit about the emergency vehicle priority system for ambulances and fire trucks that was implemented 9+ years ago rarely working while the department of transport are building an AI team and focusing on LLMs (which is idiotic on many levels). Right now the only glimmer of hope I have today is that my local member gets back in and follows up on his promise to continue a conversation I was having about the systemic issue in a week's time. It's the fact that this is all so achievable and the problems are so avoidable that pisses me off. I know what internal gov spending on IT services looks like and I described the cost of getting just a database spun up and hosted as actually criminal and highway robbery (you could buy a rack, the hardware, server space and a full time DB Admin and still have half the money left over for how much they were charging on a monthly basis... New Server every month!!) Woo. This was a long rant. But yes. They are shit and it's also not 100% the fault of the elected so change in government without interjection will not change it. There is still the Olympics coming can you imagine the amount of technology grifting that will happen unless serious changes happen.
28. If Govt IT project in healthcare …it will be at least 3-5 or possibly ever
29. Currently hospital managers have access to these numbers so they would only be creating a website with the de-identified data displaying in real-time.
30. Also i checked the website and the promise is "within 100 days" which is hilarious tbh
31. I wish we had more 24/7 GP clinics. I’ve tried the home doctor service twice and been disappointed but an actual 24/7 clinic with equipment would be great to take the load off ED.
32. >Q Health and the Government of the day The federal government skates by largely without blame despite the fact that all large Australian states have huge problems with ramping and the feds could fix it within a week by providing more funding Instead the aged care sector continues to be a shit show putting even more pressure on state hospitals (Not an actual week but you get my point)
33. And yet hospitals run like a business (ie private ones) have much lower wait times.
34. They absolutely consult medical professionals about this sort of thing, but only after their hearing aids have run out of batteries
35. They shop around until they find experts who agree with them
36. I agree 100%. Programs like CAREPACT and falls team have been great. I just saw another commenter here say they want to put MRI and CT in satellite hospitals and that's just grossly unsafe because of how underdeveloped they are currently.
37. They have this in NSW as well, it helped me in some non-urgent situations find the least busy hospital.
38. Yes, this is an incredible service and I'm glad the public has access to it now
39. My daughter might have whooping cough but by god I am not waiting a few hours to have seen!
40. She would have been safer in a hospital if something went wrong with her breathing. Waiting shouldn't take priority over a child's wellbeing.
41. Cant ask that here. The echo chamber gets angry. Labor wants to pretend it is not the party in charge
42. The continued updates they're installing? Extra bulk billed 24/7 clinics, more regional hospitals, more nurses and doctors - these all take time to build and train staff to fill - not something you can do overnight. Ramping times are trending down even with massively higher numbers.
43. Private is usually more than just the ED fee, there's gaps in any diagnostics as well. If I expect to be admitted I'll definitely go private, but I'll never forget the time my mother got sick of waiting at the PA whilst I was having an asthma attack and was struggling to breathe and took me to a private hospital and the gaps were phenomenal.
44. there's a been huge population shift since the last LNP gov and the satellite hospitals are perfect for things like a simple bone break, as i said above its saved 100,000 ED presentations
45. There was probably different things happening behind the scenes that made those wait times drastically different and any kid falling off a scooter is high priority as it's a high impact injury.
46. They critically assess your symptoms based off the questions and how they are answered. I have experience in the field and its a lot more involved than people would think. The nurses will choose your point of care ultimately and the questions are just a tool to help reach a safe outcome. Sometimes the answers they have aren't what you expect and it can be frustrating, but it's also ultimately up to the individual what they do.
47. I used 13health recently and found it a great service. First instance they directed me to an urgent care clinic, second time was after hours and they were able to organise a telehealth consult with an ED doctor. Definitely a service I would recommend and use again.
48. You're downvoted but you're partially right. 13HEALTH isn't *quite* what you're saying, but it's highly risk-averse due to the nature of telehealth. They generate their fair share of inappropriate ambulance callouts.
49. Emergency CT and MRI are useless if there's no operating theatre or ICU in the satellite hospital. Just going to result in more ambos transporting from the satellies to actual hospitals. Also I just checked their health page and nothing was mentioned about keeping the 7 new satellite hospitals labor has proposed.
50. Looking at your comment history of you shitting your pants about the alp 24/7 reeks of desperation beyond anything I could post.
51. People’s perceptions change with information. In the case, more information has a detrimental effect. It’s all well and good to speculate but there are academic studies on this and it’s demonstrably worse on patient health to advertise wait times.
52. Not to mention it’s important people go to the hospital in their catchment more often than not - public hospitals are funded based on the number of people they are expected to help!
53. Hmm... well sometimes when it's like a 4+hr wait for a cat 5 that can be seen at their GP, satellite or non-urgent clinics, I'm pretty sure they're given the ;) heads up ;) about alternative options if they aren't too fussed on waiting. DISCLAIMER: maybe it happens, maybe it doesn't...but maybe it does.
54. Funnily enough you don't get "pushed down the list" though. Annoying as it is on triage with people coming to complain about times, sometimes (sometimes!) It helps us pick up someone who's deteriorated in the waiting room. But hey, if you think the wait times suck, chuck a pen to paper and complain to your local member 😉
55. 3-5 years, $1 billion over budget and won't work whoever is in government.
56. I'm sure that is what they would do, instead of something more logical like ensuring the information is going into a data warehouse centrally to use that information without having to ask for it. Then display from there. Not saying to do it, but there is no data strategy or consistency in government and a lot of people working in the data side of individual departments apparently know this... I really should get access to the real time streaming opendata but the other data sets are just flat out published reports and not datasets, using them directly for anything outside of a limited range is like averaging averages.
57. Name a government agency that isn't above changing the milestone dates and saying everything is still on time and there's nothing to see here.
58. Private hospitals divert complex or serious cases to the public system - like literally shift them via ambulance to a different ED. Easy to keep the wait times down when you can just chuck something in the "too hard" basket and have it not count.
59. Because fewer ppl can afford them. Easy to have a lower wait time when your customer base is limited
60. Some of the MIICs can't even staff their ultrasound service. The general public seem to have an obsession with MRI/CT ignoring the cost of the former and radiation of the latter. A good example of *what they need, not what they necessarily want.*
61. Don’t go to ED for non-urgent issues and we wouldn’t be in this situation
62. You’ve heard of people dying in hospital waiting right? No need to lecture me thanks. Also, I’ve been to hospital with my children and waited 8+ hours only to be told to load them up with Panadol and Nuerofen which by the way can induce asthma attacks. Hospitals aren’t the best all and end all. You’re lucky if you get an intuitive nurse and doctor that will listen and not just write you off.
63. There are some, I guess it depends on the kind of hospital cover you happen to have how much it stings. Thankfully mine covered everything but the initial ED fee, and the wait was kind of worth it on that specific day. It’s definitely not what should be the expected default option though!
64. It was pre satellite hospitals. I’m sure I’m not the only one,nine who will be considering everything since 2015 going into the ballot box, not just the last few weeks..
65. lol I’m bad at communicating. My point is we should NOT be knowing the waitlist. They assess us and take us in according to injury, as it should be
66. That was my exact point. Mine wasn’t a major issue so of course I waited. My sons was and they grabbed him right away
67. Also the Children's hospital seems to be run quite differently.
68. I used to be an RN, I’m quite aware of nursing assessment and triage. Thanks though.
