Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Norway has $1.71 Trillion in assets in it s sovereign fund from nationalised resources. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Pension_Fund_of_Norway Norway is the UK's biggest gas supplier https://www.sunsave.energy/blog/uk-gas-sources In 2024, Norway's oil and gas industry is expected to contribute nearly 24 percent to total GDP. In the period of consideration, figures oscillated between 10 and 35 percent. The industry is one of the most important in the country, making up a staggering 73 percent of Norway's export value in 2022. https://www.statista.com/statistics/1450033/oil-industry-share-of-gdp-norway/#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20Norway's%20oil%20and,Norway's%20export%20value%20in%202022.
2. Since you brought up Norway. The primary issue that this election decended into was abortion, do you care to know what the abortion laws are in Norway because they are significantly more restrictive then they are in QLD.
3. my bad, who owns the media nexus in the western world?
4. There’s more to governance than housing. And so much of that is stuffed.
5. Oh ffs. Let’s not do this as well. Haven’t we suffered enough?
6. None, most countries are starting to turn conservative. Possibly a rock off the coast may suit.
7. That’s fine, as the majority are conservative he would have no issue with the referendum.
8. Should be better than the lack of policy from the last 9 years. Youth crime only became an issue in SEQ after the many high profile deaths over the 2 years, this has been happening in regional QLD for 15 years. Labor’s policy is release all these awesome things right before an Election to buy the welfare and city votes. I’m glad regional qld saw through the bullshit and voted to change the status quo. And if he doesn’t stick to his promises then he’ll be another 1 term premier.
9. So what do you think is the solution to the families I have where every child has been incarcerated multiple times as both a child and an adult? Where the parents refuse services (which they are allowed to do and there is nothing we can do to force them)? Or where there are 7 and 8 services and agencies involved with the family and yet nothing changes. How do you propose breaking the cycle?
10. We live in one of the safest countries in the world in a state where crime is fairly dramatically trending down. I can poke fun of the fact that this has become a massive election issue and the death of a government given all this. It’s pretty embarrassing.
11. Crime happens everywhere dude. Youth crime is trending down. And even if it wasn’t, crime overall is dramatically trending down. You can’t stop crime completely and you’re a sucker if you think you can, an even bigger one if you think the LNP can. Of course people who love someone who’s been killed are going to be upset. Where did I suggest otherwise? Get a grip loser
12. Wrong, the regions had been entrenched labour voters for a long time. You also haven't considered the Katters are extremely pro environment and it's more likely it would allow them to grow across all of North Queensland.
13. Thanks for the response. I still am not convinced that this is evidence of a youth crime epidemic. Security camera footage has increased and is really being harnessed by the media. There are folks in my workplace that love sky news and channel 9, all they talk about is youtg crime. Those of us that are younger, live in the same suburbs and are more on the ABC side of things are not exposed to it at all and it is not even remotely a fear. Sorry to hear that you are afraid, wouldn't be nice. Cost of living crisis almost certainly leading up more crime in general, so it's not unjustified.

15. What do you mean it doesn't deter them? You weren't robbed.
16. Crime is indisputably down, you cannot argue with statistics. Correlation ≠ causation. Just because a phenomenon you don't like is happening doesn't mean it's the governments fault. "Adult crime = adult time" does absolutely nothing to address the root cause and will only breed more repeat offenders. Multiple studies have come to this conclusion. It's called recidivism.
17. Bro shut up. Your opinions aren't founded in truth. I don't care.
18. Energy market experts. Power grid experts. Nuclear experts. Power generation experts. Vs Dave on your Social Media feed who's "done his research". Ok.
19. "Experts" source the [csiro](https://www.csiro.au/en/news/all/articles/2023/december/nuclear-explainer) yeah id consider them experts and not what a bunch of twits on the internet said
20. 1. Wrong 2. Wrong 3. Wrong 4. Wrong. They're state parties. They have nothing to do with foreign relations. That's the federal government's job.
21. Nothing going to change that will have any real effect on your life, same shit new party. Stop your crying.
22. That's the point of your post, people must be brain dead or brainwashed by the media to vote for the party you don't like. If only they weren't stupid people they would think the same as a smart person like you does.
23. You've betrayed both of them. What a shamefully bad parent.
24. Mainstream media create their own hype, and the viewers don't even realise it, then the world ends when other people critically think.
25. The coal royalties were offsetting most if not all of those expenses, and the state is in a surplus. That won't be a thing anymore, so those expenses will either be passed on to us, or the lnp will sack thousands of service workers like they did under Newman.
26. If it's so innocuous then why do people have the need to lie about their sex? We can stop being disingenuous - we know that impacts women when men start invading their safe spaces, sports, awards, prisons etc.
27. There’s literally nothing stopping a guy from walking into a woman’s restroom. Do you think there’s like a bouncer checking ID’s for that? As for prisons: I actually looked into that one and it’s done on a case-by-case basis (not hard to do when there’s an incredibly small amount of transgender offenders). They asses the potential risk of the person in question, to determine which prison they should go to. I’m sure in your head some burly guy is just declaring g in the court room floor that they’re a women to try get into their prison but it doesn’t work like that. You have to have already been known to be trans for years for the courts to consider it. And the fact of the matter is that any transgender woman that gets put in a mens prison *will* be raped. As for sports? I don’t know why that’s the governments business. If a sporting agency wants to allow or disallow athletes based on sex/what puberty a person goes through (I know some won’t allow trans women that have gone through male puberty but are fine with ones that started her earlier) then that’s really up to them. And again, we’re talking about a vanishingly small group of people. You really can just analyse them case-by-case.
28. >And what of the campaign that Labor ran? No, I'm talking about Crisafulli and the LNP.
29. I'm not contesting the result. The majority of our media is owned by one family with the same political stance, and you see no issue with that? You represent the average intelligence of an LNP voter.
30. You understand there are many other factors outside of just a government being a reason for crime going up, correct?
31. How is your perception of Labors political stance relevant to anything I have said? Without googling it, tell me what neoliberalism means.
32. Do you mean like finishing the most ambitious pumped hydro project in the world, projected to reduce our energy bills and provide us with energy diversity and security for the next century, all scrapped to prop up and protect our oligarchs and their interests? Or do you prefer it lining the pockets of multinational corporations who give zero shits about the countries and peoples that they extract the wealth from (e.g. Adani), or by giving Gina/Twiggy/Palmer some more intergenerational wealth off the backs of Queenslanders and our resources (and they'll be the first to leave the country if there is any resulting climate apocalypse).
33. Lol, you may have to stop and charge a few more times to get to Burketwon. But seriously could we afford or would we accept the cost of a totally highway spec national grid. And why would a town of, what 300 people a gazillion k's from anywhere get a national highway standard road. I live regional not in the south east and know money gets spent based on population. In the last 3-4 years I have driven 80,000k's and our highway network is pretty dam good for our population.
34. How the fuck is it cope? I'm not in denial of the result. Imbecile.
35. It's rude to try and lecture me on what fascism is when it's clear as day you do not know the first thing about said fascism.
36. Dude, you had two options. A party that was for the people, and a party that was for the coal mining industry. You chose the latter and get defensive when people call you stupid. Seriously?
37. There are no clear-cut plans to ban coal. Even if that came to fruition, coal is not the only thing unearthed in this state. I don't understand your point.
38. 1. Stating that a liberal government will cut admin staff from hospitals 2. Implying/stating that doctors are unaffected by funding cuts. I’m saying that liberals in my view, are less likely to cut hospital funding. Even if they did, it is up to hospital administrators to decide how to save money or who to cut, not politicians. Regarding 2, I’m saying doctors already have been affected significantly by dwindling funding, although most have too much skin in the game to bother worrying about it.
39. Boomer here. I've become even more left leaning than I was when I was young. And all my friends are similar. Best not to generalise. Saw hoards of young Liberals at the Liberal celebration last night. Don't think they'll be progressive now or ever.
40. I’m a boomer. Have always voted to the left. Interest that boomers are getting the blame when presumably in previous elections we somehow managed to get Labor elected. So tell me what has changed? I haven’t stopped voting ALP. Nor have my lefty boomer friends. The main difference is demographic. There are more younger voters. Yes. That’s what has changed. So maybe think a bit more deeply than just using prejudice to form your opinions.
41. Not all boomers.🙂 True though, I could count on one hand the number of left-leaning boomers I’ve met in the last 20 years. One possible explanation: An eye opener for me was during a few short-term gigs I did in central Queensland a few years ago, spending time in mining camps and the occasional pub or sports club. Every television set I walked past was set to a Sky channel, which I learned is a free-to-air network in the regions. It was fucken POISON, and seemingly inescapable. People would gormlessly sit and gawp at it during mealtimes, sometimes offering comments about African gangs (which almost none of those blokes would have had any experience of) and how they “don’t want to be welcome to my own country“, etc. The exception was sometimes seeing Koschy talk shit on Channel 7 in the mess hall at breakfast.
42. Generation what? Maybe don't use that word if you want to be taken seriously
43. Don't sit there pretending that you wouldn't have done exactly what boomers did if you were born at the same time. We will enjoy a better standard of living than our grandchildren, not because we are selfish but because by the time they are adults the world will have fewer resources and Australia and the world, will be more populated. That we have outgrown our planet is not one generation's fault.
44. Since the rich as fuck Fox execs got the jab, I figured it was safe enough for me
45. Exactly. So all these healthcare workers who only had two vaxxes are they now labelled anti-vaxxers because sure they are not on their 5th booster??
46. love it, package that in the next 3 slogan election campaign bonanza! You are hired !
47. Yeah, for people living on the edge, that $50 to $100 means something.
48. So, unless they can do something that fixes everything, they shouldn't try anything? How dare they try to ease cost of living slightly? The first step didn't magically change the world so just don't bother at all, huh?
49. I fact checked this since I thought it was an absolutely ridiculous number but you're actually right. A Guardian article from May 2023 outlines it really well. Lemme guess that more private prisons are coming to Qld? [article in question](https://amp.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/30/cost-of-keeping-queensland-child-in-custody-hits-2000-a-day-report-finds)
50. Honestly, if it's done properly in a good YDC like those being opened in Capricornia and Cairns, it's money we'll spent. These centres are nothing remotely like a prison. They are closer to a boarding school and give these kids a genuine chance to change. The sad thing is that these centres were only broke ground recently and won't be open until 2026 at the earliest. Think of the money that was wasted building covid detention camps that could have been redirectd into building more of these kinda of centres.
51. Kids that aren’t hungry may also have better education outcomes.
52. Yea heard that too. Which is basically going to result in more people using and addicted to meth which will lead to more crimes because most people aren’t going to take meth if they know it’s meth and it’s a super awful and addictive drug. But ya know I’m sure those 17-18 year olds deserve it for being young and curious and wanting to push boundaries as per their expected development… it’s their fault for trying pills in the first place…
53. I think that came from a specific case where even the judge wanted to hand out a bigger sentence but wasn't able to. The case in question is the murder of Emma Lovell, where the maximum sentence the judge was able to give out was 15 years, and even that required special authority. It's almost criminal that the violent thug who murdered a mother in her own home on boxing day 2022 by jaming a knife into her chest with such force that he snapped the blade off the handle will be out on parole before his 30th birthday while that family will suffer for a generation at minimum.
54. Are you saying jail time is not a deterrent? Sorry genuine question.
55. You didn't say 'more jail time is the forefront of the policy', though. You said it was their only policy.
56. That's a completely fair point. Please refer to the last paragraph of my post.
57. I'm not a liberal vote mate. I'm just trying to encourage conversations that are based in reality and an actual understanding of what the other side wants rather than strawmen like 'their only policy is more jail time'. I think parties should be criticised based on their actual positions and policies.
58. Okay, like I said if you want to argue it won't actually happen then fair enough
59. When I lived in Rockhampton it seemed about 20 years the rest of the industrialised world. So would that shift the generational boundaries?
60. I make sure my neighbours house look more desirable than mine :D
61. I'm removing this comment because I was insensitive to victims experiences
62. I somewhat agree, but they are noted for inflammatory and emotionally manipulative language, and frequent enough occurrences of no sources, or poor sources https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/news-com-au/
63. What did they improve? Because they've had the reigns for the last decade, and all I've seen is more people on the streets as they do sweet fuck all about any real problems, all while they jerk off about their "strong plan" that's been in the making for as long as typewriters have existed.
64. So, if you voted for the LNP (I'm making an assumption, sorry if wrong), you voted against the party that has implemented not only the largest cost of living measures in the country, but also ensured they were all anti-inflationary so the situation wasn't exacerbated, all while having a budget surplus thanks to the mining tax... Voting against a party that had promised to purchase fuel stations and cause competition with publicly held stations and cap the daily price increase of fuel. Voting in favour of a government that has pledged to scrap the mining tax, thus returning us to a budget deficit while somehow paying for the promises they've made (probably Newman style service-cuts). So, we're going to have public services delivered less efficiently, with a budget deficit (because the mining tax was allowing all of these things), and this is in your best interest how? Because they are going to put more 12 year olds in prison, at $760,000 a year each? I really fail to see where anyone's interests are being served by this party other than mining companies (who are profiting from YOUR resources as an Australian citizen). Also, climate change is a very real threat, whether you believe it or not. As someone with a degree in Astrophysics and Environmental Sciences (double major), I'll say it can certainly be blown out of proportion by some advocacy groups, but the research does show that if it's not dealt with, there are definitely points of no return that would not be great for most life on the planet (Which is why we have reductions targets). Regardless, renewables are cleaner, cheaper and well, renewable... I really don't understand how anyone is opposed to less carbon in the atmosphere, less water being used for cooling, and less radioactive fly ash coming off coal plants.
65. You are a real monster. How bout you vote for others?
66. That research included Facebook posts from someone’s aunty, the Joe Rogan podcast and some QAnon page.
67. Why do people look at News Limited, read a surface level take including obviously pushing an agenda, and go "oh this must be true". I can handle people being dumb, I can't handle people being so obtuse that they take away their own rights. Every woman in QLD should have showed up.
68. I'm not happy about it, and my close friends are super progressive. Unfortunately we are outnumbered by bogans. Steve Irwin would be ashamed
69. the LNP won't need to do heavy lifting. KAP will introduce, DC will allow conscience vote, they're absolves of a lot of blame. it might not genuinely in their plan, but they will not actively shoot down a proposal
70. Plus it can be easily overturned in appeals by other MPs. It's not worth the effort.
71. I was replying to the above guy who deleted his dumb comment about mining companies being overtaxed, didnt think i needed a sarcasm tag in context
72. I dont think Norway is a utopia, ive been there. But they at least treat their common resources as a common resource for public benefit
73. Do you think the media has ever been on the side of the Labour party? The ALP has lost touch with the very heart land that created the Labour party. Labour only has themselves to blame even after the Katters have them a hail Mary.
74. Someone doesn't understand the word "bigotry", what a bizarre way to attempt to use the word 😂
75. Ok thank you. Ill pull up the offshore oil rigs to rent website
76. Rather than voting for “change” alone maybe vote for evidence based policy for the issues of concern. Study after study has shown that punitive action and detention centres only increase recidivism. Crime doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Rather than abusing the rights of children maybe vote for a fit-for-purpose social safety net, education, and community building. All of which are proven to actually reduce crime and prevent recidivism.
77. How do you propose fixing it for those you care for?
78. Nah, your way of poking fun of it wasn’t great. Don’t downplay the crime itself, make fun of the idea that it is happening constantly on every street corner
79. My 25 yo daughter had someone break in to her home while she was in it last week, brazenly taking her car keys and the jewelry she was given for her 18th and 21st by her now deceased Aunt. Get fucked with your downplaying of the emotional and mental effect of having crime committed against you.
80. The regional areas of Australia are not the safest in the world, the cities are the safest in the world.
81. Youth crime is trending down as a state level but trending up in regional Queensland. You know, a lot of the places where Labor lost their seats. With Walker making a fool of himself the last few years and Harper the idiot brushing off any criticism a lot of the people in Townsville were voting against them rather than against Miles.
82. I've personally had my house raided by kids and I can tell you it's not a good feeling. I was out of the house for 60 minutes. I literally had anxiety for years because of it. It's not just replaceable items. They stole stuff that was passed down for many generations. So again, fuck you for downplaying any type of crime you piece of shit
83. >I still am not convinced that this is evidence of a youth crime epidemic. So you're ignoring the lived experience of people because it doesn't suit the narrative you want to believe. That's a bit arrogant. >Security camera footage has increased and is really being harnessed by the media. I showed you footage uploaded by someone a block down from us, not the media. >Those of us that are younger, live in the same suburbs and are more on the ABC side of things are not exposed to it at all and it is not even remotely a fear. I am on "the ABC side of things". The ABC has reported [on this issue](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-05-25/goondiwindi-residents-terrified-as-youths-torch-stolen-cars/100133312) [multiple times](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-04/insurance-premiums-price-of-a-youth-crime-crisis/102295936). You just don't want to hear it. >Sorry to hear that you are afraid, wouldn't be nice. I don't want your meaningless apology. I want you to stop being so ignorant. >so it's not unjustified. So violent breaking and entering is not unjustified in your view? What an obtuse comment. If this is how progressive Brisbanites reflect on the issues affecting regional Queensland, get ready for a long time in opposition.
84. Crime is down from when? What time period? From last year or last month? Or from when labor took power? Like you can clearly see a massive increase especially in regional areas except for the last year or two…
85. Ah yes let’s coddle offenders and release them on bail after 40 offences. Look I’ve been to uni too mate and studied statistical analysis of research data, but you’re putting all your focus on quantitative research and totally ignoring qualitative research which is just as important. As in people’s sentiment and anecdotal experience. And the experiences and sentiments AND stats show that violent youth offending and violent offences in general ARE ON THE RISE. So stop trying to gaslight
86. The Dunning-Kruger effect is on full display with this one. ‘But but the crime statistics show it’s lower’. Recorded crime statistics for some offence categories DO NOT accurately reflect the actual level of crime in the community. This is because the number of incidents recorded are affected by other factors. In particular, the public willingness to report crime. Many crimes which occur are not reported to police and will therefore not be recorded - for example, a large number of assaults, sexual assaults and robberies are not reported to police. Reported crime is not the same as actual crime. Absolute 🤡.
87. Which opinions are not truthful exactly? I don't see anything within what I wrote that isn't an accurate reflection of the current reality. Or, perhaps you just wish to deny that reality. Is that it?
88. No, you're moving the goal post. Your original claim was that people must think it's either fascist or communist. That has nothing to do with media.
89. Lol. What has the LNP actually said on this topic? AFAIK its some combination of not supporting late term abortion, and wanting to restrict it to the first trimester. Do you unironically support unrestricted abortion to full term (or should I use the Orwellian alternative "reproductive healthcare")? If not full term, where is your cutoff exactly? I think your average person on the street has sensible views on reasonable restrictions and this is actually reflected in the result.
