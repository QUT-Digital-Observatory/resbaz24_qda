Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. I upvoted you because someone else downvoted and I think downvoted an effort post is always a shitty and cowardly move. You put in a lot of your time and they click a button. Anyway I hate landlords and probably disagree with you on some points but I wasn't aware of the watchdog thing and it's certainly a valid point.
2. But the thing is, all the other unions are still pushing Labor. Seems like it was an unspoken thing in the union world that the CFMEU was a stain on the entire union movement in Australia. Turns out all you have to do to not go into to administration is be associated with criminal gangs, launder money, harass people and engage in vast amounts of corruption.
3. > Unions do have a place but I have first hand experince of them meeting at a maccas and saying stuff like "lets fuck them up" while planning work disruption What exactly is the problem here? That's an extremely common thing to say and in no way indicative of a negative? > ive been spoken to in an intimidatory way by a union high up who wasnt even across the facts What a completely vague nothing, so nondescript as to be useless. > ive had a union rep say no when i told them they should take the fight on behalf of an employee. Did you bring it to other reps attention, or raise it at the union meeting? > Many union reps are great but your statements are ignorant to reality. How, you've not actually provided literally any example of how it is beyond some literal nothing statements. > Are you seriously arguing that the only people who get pissed off at union action are managers who want to exploit workers? Lol. Yes, or those who guzzled down anti union propaganda, unions exist to protect and uplift workers.
4. I think he just massively misread the room. All the people he spoke to were probably complaining about the cost of a new stadium, and so, he thought that a watered-down stadium plan that would save a couple hundred million dollars by making use of existing venues would appeal to voters. What he neglected to consider is the fact that Brisbane is in need of a new stadium regardless of the Olympics, and his QSAC plan wouldn‚Äôt actually leave the city with any legacy infrastructure.
5. Here's hoping. Will probably be the only positive thing to come out of this government
6. Yeah hope this is the case. Labor commissioned quirk to do the work then ignored it. Was crazy stupid
7. Probably true. And I have reservations about spending 3B on a new stadium. If seq spend is going to be smaller. Would rather the cash spent on more busways and rails at least.
8. Oh hes made many decisions, just take everything he said during this election and think of the opposite eg. "Its not part of our plan" = "it is part of our plan"
9. public hospitals tender contracts for fucking shitloads of things lmao, you're delusional. I support Australia and QLD's system of public healthcare, I am simply recognising the government's absolute right to make whatever staffing arrangements they see fit given their mandate. public hospitals already have private staff working in them, many of whom are doctors. as for research, why do we need to fund it? it's not like all health research worldwide will stop if we stop funding it.
10. if there's a need for the job then the private sector can provide it. I'm not even anarchocap, I know there are services which require public funding, but if even nursing is not on that list I really doubt your partner was.
11. While reducing ambulance ramping? It will be interesting to see how that works out for them
12. Oh cool, meanwhile the closest large hospital in our region still has no cath lab, so cardiac patients have the option of hopefully being airlifted to hospital 4 hours away or dying. Cool cool cool.
13. I'd say that there would be a good chance as you'll be studying for about 4 years, in which time there will be another election, and the Qld LNP don't have a great record as of late for getting re-elected for a second term.
14. There might be a job but you'll be chronically short staffed, underpaid, and unappreciated. ü•≤
15. Don‚Äôt worry about whether this a job for you or not. Worry whether you will burn out.
16. Don't be turned off by it, healthcare is one of the best fields for graduate employment. You'll find a job.
17. One part of the stupidity of the cycle is governments restrict the part of the budget departments get for headcount (LNP because they want small govt and ALP because they are scared of the LNP carrying on about too many public servants). Both sides then expect the public service to deliver services and the only option then is to hire contractors to deliver certain packages of work that would in the past have been delivered by a public servant. cue the cycle of increasing 'contractor costs' instead of actually hiring someone to do the work.
18. Strange way to try and comprehend but you do you boo
19. ‚ÄòLoving‚Äô was the worst possible typo you could make there
20. Hear me out.. why don't we have a name and shame list for .. wait for it... Sex offenders? If u diddle with the innocent you don't deserve privacy. Not saying it should be a full on " this guy lives here" but a name and shame at least would give the community some relief and also give warning to any child or woman or whatever information and knowledge on whos dangerous and lurking around Not sure what peeing in public has to do with any of that...unless they are right near a school or playground?
21. Because it's not permanent but drastically reduces suicide attempts. It just hits pause to prevent dysphoria while they process their decision to move forward or not. It's life saving care and can be stopped at anytime
22. If you figure out that your body is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù your mind is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù and you have the choice between agony, addiction, eating disorders and possibly death, or puberty blockers, I hope the puberty blockers are available to you.
23. You chose the most rejected and flawed report to make your point. The Cass report denied evidence on the basis that studies did not use randomised control tests or double blind studies. As you can imagine it's not possible, nor ethical, to conduct blind RCTs on puberty. People tend to notice if their voice starts cracking or if breasts start growing >sexual reassignment surgery I don't even know why I'm bothering with someone who thinks this is a thing
24. Well said. Seems that the misinformation has been making the rounds that it‚Äôs the safer and proven thing to do- yet the evidence actually says to the contrary. I forget the statistic but it was those who undergo gender affirmation surgery at something of an order of magnitude of ten - more likely to commit suicide later. It‚Äôs pretty messed up it‚Äôs being pushed on the kids- I have no problem with LGBTQIA+ community, all my friends since I was a kid, most are gay. I have trans family. Lots of people are getting mad at the lgbt community for the pushing it onto kids etc., and i keep reminding them don‚Äôt blame them, it‚Äôs not their fault. Most are just as brainwashed and it‚Äôs horrible, no different to how I‚Äôm brainwashed in other respects; but besides the point - there‚Äôs clearly an agenda here and we, the people, are being used as pawns to push and fight eachother over it. I hope everyone can feel comfortable with their body and their mind, I don‚Äôt care what they do- so long as it doesn‚Äôt involve me or try to make me change my life - great. You do you. But the governments / corporate bodies using us for their agenda is bullshit and needs to stop.
25. This isn't a left or right discussion. There is no economic component here, it is medical science, and as much as some politicians pretend, it is not their expertise
26. It's kool aid, and yep, was tasty and got me through my uni courses that centred around critical thinking and material analysis!
27. You do know there‚Äôs a whole range of medical reasons these medications are prescribed right? Including for severely disabled children who have hormone imbalances that lead to early-onset puberty, as well as applications in the treatment of certain medical conditions and cancer in children?
28. The benefit of reduced suicide outweighs the negatives (which is how every medical intervention is assessed).
29. Yup that's the big issue. At the moment the proposal is basically to cut through from the new "Caboolture West" through farms and houses at the back of Caboolture and Elimbah, and link it back up to Beerburrum Road within 500m of the Elimbah School with a possible link to Steve Irwin and the Bruce further north under Stage 5 (still in development). Our proposal as a community has been to keep it further west, follow the existing electricity corridor, go through the forestry and link it up to Steve Irwin Way properly. That way it still serves the purpose of ringroading Caboolture and serves as a better Bruce Highway alternative for people in the north of Brisbane, but has less impact on lives and communities.
30. > I'm just reminding people it's not the end of the world Jesus. Except this is a thread asking the reasons people have heard for those voting for the LNP. > Does the idea of a registery scare you? Way to miss my point entirely. > Edit:Nevermind just saw you're a vegan Ok?
31. My bad, the reddit app didn't update all comments after I initially loaded the thread. Just read through that document you linked. Did we read the same document? We're talking about LNP's plan right? I see a lot of yellow question marks denoting "Not a clear plan/position" under the LNP column. Also to point out that the Labor response was 10 pages of actual plan and information, versus the 3 page email from LNP with no real details? To your TAFE example, the LNP says that "Over the last nine years, Labor has missed their apprenticeship target by 17,600." and then go on to state that "LNP is committed to improving apprenticeship completions and boosting Queensland's skilled workforce" But...then they don't actually expand on HOW they intend to do that? Where have the LNP actually stated what their plan is? It really seems like they through together this 3 page email response to QTU's questions, filled it with empty promises and no actual plans. Anyone can say "Yep we'll fix that, right as rain", but how can you believe that they will when they haven't shown us HOW they will fix it?
32. The conspiracy theorist in me really wants to believe that they don't teach a lot of Australian history on purpose. The coalition doesn't have an amazing track record with economic management yet, beyond the boom years under Howard (there is even a lot of debate to be had there), people seem to just take it as an unquestioned truth.
33. I don't think most people who voted on the crime issue cared about what might or might not make a difference in 15-18 years, but would like to stop having their belongings stolen every week by the same group of people now.
34. And so what? It‚Äôs wild that people think that ‚Äúchildren should be punished for the faults of their parents (that they didn‚Äôt choose‚Äù is a rock solid argument. Then they‚Äôll go vote for the LNP if those kids end up committing crimes
35. Like I said, I have two kids, how much does it cost for two pieces of buttered bread, some cheese, ham and an apple? I garuntee you the people who don‚Äôt provide lunches, will happily spend what money they do have elsewhere. I‚Äôd suggest it‚Äôs less about the cost, because the cost is negligible, and more about parents who can‚Äôt be arsed to put a pack lunch together. It‚Äôs a choice. At some point, personal responsibility has to come into it.
36. It sounds cold, but statistically speaking, how many kids are actually going hungry? I grew up dirt poor, but my mum managed to send me to school with a few sangers, a muesli bar and an apple.
37. I was obviously joking, but it looks like Labour supporters have lost their sense of humour, along with their government of choice. I actually voted LNP because I don't like Labour's policies. I don't like them on a federal level, and I dislike them slightly less on a state level. It is surprising that so many people are surprised about an ALP loss when only 3/10 people preferenced the ALP. There must be some sheltered lives out there.
38. To maintain the status quo of supply, Brisbane needs 5000 new apartments per annum completed. This year is was less than 1200. Next year will be lower. It's been a long time since we've actually hit the minimum required. Scarcity of accommodation will never be overcome. The voters need people. They need workers. The workers need accommodation. Prices will keep going up no matter what.
39. Reread my comments. I completely agree that workers need protection.
40. Those are the things the unions are supposed to protect and fight for. Pay and working conditions. That's precisely their job. And where they should be focusing their efforts. The union bosses should not be earning $1m and other benefits. Unions are supposed to protect the workers not dictate a project.
41. I think you nailed it. They chose not to respond, as you suggested, because the internet isn't for them today. You can't tell people to go away, and then complain when they do.
42. I can‚Äôt speak on behalf of other people. Heck, I didn‚Äôt even vote.
43. Here‚Äôs your prize üèÜ Edit: people seem to have missed that this is a prize for being the most stupid which goes to this idiotic answer to a very reasonable question.
44. The Gillard government was firmly against it, and the ‚Äúconscience‚Äù vote was open enough that Gay politician Penny Wong voted against it. They could have passed it. The Libs took it to a plebiscite, as it should have been and it passed.
45. I wouldn‚Äôt trust a cop to lie in bed straight lmao
46. Weird how our economy faired way better than NSW and life was relatively normal apart from the idiots down south demanding to cross the border so they could share the virus with us and make us have to go into lockdowns as well. How many days was Sydney in lockdown compared to Brisbane?
47. Did you not see how badly the LNP governments in NSWs did? QLD was so incredibly lucky. Heck so many of the pressures QLD has faced has been from the southern states flooding here.
48. Are you cookers still banging on about covid? Time to move on bro
49. I watched my staunchly economic conservative sister in law from an incredibly wealthy family vote against the libs at the last fed election. she said it was pretty fuckin amazing how shit they are.
50. Did I suggest banning people from voting lol? That‚Äôs quite the strawman you‚Äôve got there xD
51. Um that is not an equivalent example. Optional voting means if you want to you can, if you dont want to you don‚Äôt - the exact same system we have currently for breeding. In the above probably 2,3 and 4 wouldn‚Äôt have bothered showing up if it was optional
52. No one in Australia has the power to print money from nothing. Also the prison system is a massive business
53. You support people living in tents without sanitary facilities, living in fear, and getting rained on. Sick
54. I do not wish suffering on anyone. I was trying to point out that the thing that (rightly) offended you might also be a question you‚Äôd need to consider asking of your own family. Because the LNP platform that they voted for is all about ensuring that specific groups of people suffer. That does not mean that I condone the other (clearly not LNP-voting) commenters wish for your family to suffer either.
55. $1.24M from Coal Australia straight into the LNP coffers. Wait till they drop developer donations from being illegal.
56. Agree - look at the differences in fibrosis, entitlements and on-site fatalities between unionised and non-unionised workplaces.
57. Heh if you think that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre actually walk off site you‚Äôve got some learning to do
58. Of course. I should probably edit my comment to refer to more specific unions.
59. yeah dude I'm totally sure that the most powerful and influential branch of the CFMEU being a criminal enterprise is entirely isolated to just that branch. there is NO WAY that any other branch is similar to the Victorian CFMEU. when were you diagnosed?
60. No legacy stadium maybe, but massively overhauled public transport infrastructure which can be used by everyone not just those who enjoy sport/can't afford tickets to those events. When picking Olympic hosts, they are choosing places that are looking to build sustainable cities rather then a couple of new stadiums and a cardboard athletes' village 6 hours outside the city with no way of getting there. The sunshine coast rail extension; Brisbane metro and the new rail construction through the city are the legacy infrastructure.
61. Unbelievably stupid decision from Miles. Lost my vote as soon as he rejected the central finding from Quirks review. Unsure why Crisifulli needs another 100 day review when we just did one ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
62. What if every government thought that way? Why should QLD have a share in the world‚Äôs research fund. Do you think we should just sit back and be beholden to the rest of the world to do it for us?
63. As I said. It will now be filled by the same person contracting. Get a huge redundancy and get re employed as a contractor making heaps more. Great till you look where all that money comes from. My partner is not a health worker. Think you are thinking someone else.
64. Step 1. Privatise QAS so ambulances stop being free. Step 2. When it costs people a few hundred bucks for an ambulance, they won't call one. Especially during a cost of living crisis where a few hundred dollars can be the difference between making rent that week or not. Step 3. Less ambulances being called = less ramping.
65. I‚Äôm already working 2+hours unpaid overtime. I am not doing more for christafuckwit
66. The main print mouthpiece in the state is Murdoch-owned. Most of the free-to-air networks that provide any kind of "local" news do not know what "investigative journalism" is. We know the LNP are full of shit when they stated repeatedly that they "hAvE a PlAn". However, the media will definitely go into bat for them, like they always do. We'll probably only find the truth once they are removed from Government in 4+ years time.
67. People are already dying because of our shit healthcare system because its an inefficient government run mess
68. Public urination can apparently become a public indecency charge that gets you on the sex offender registry in the US. I have no idea how true this is, but I imagine it‚Äôs a common defense used by offenders who‚Äôre arrested for flashing kids. And I didn‚Äôt know there was a sex offender registry for QLD (I only just found out [Jackway](https://www.couriermail.com.au/truecrimeaustralia/police-courts-qld/douglas-jackway-back-at-precinct-after-sex-offender-order-breach/news-story/3834cc576e87cd0c2e069afaa650ee93?amp) was released again back in April), can someone link pls?
69. That's not exactly what research shows. Not at all. [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11063965/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11063965/)
70. > > > I don't even know why I'm bothering with someone who thinks this is a thing SRS is absolutely a thing and a name used by a pretty large part of the trans community, in more recent years folks have instead used "Gender reassignment surgery" or "Gender affirmation surgery", but that name is absolutely still around, it used to literally be on the governments documentation for getting your gender marker changed on your birth certificate for example. The rest of their post is shite, but SRS is absolutely a thing/commonly used name for it.
71. [From the FAQ](https://cass.independent-review.uk/home/publications/final-report/final-report-faqs/) > *Did the Review reject studies that were not double blind randomised control trials in its systematic review of evidence for puberty blockers and masculinising / feminising hormones?* > No. There were no randomised control studies identified in the systematic reviews, but other types of studies were included if they were well designed and conducted. There's more information on that page, including a reference to the section of the report that sets out the the standards. Have you read the report or are you just regurgitating misinformation you've heard about it?
72. Causation vs correlation. Society is transphobic. Trans people will continue to die while we continue to spout bigotry in the media and online. Without access to gender affirming care enough trans people will commit suicide that medically it IS safer and more ethical to let young people take puberty blockers and hrt. If a small percentage decide to detransition later, de-transitioning is much much lower risk than not prescribing puberty blockers in the first place. Medical treatment and best practices weigh up the risks of prescribing something vs not prescribing it. This is why we have the pill for women, but no pill for men. The consequences of not taking the pill for women is pregnancy which increases the risk of death and other adverse health outcomes. That riskthat outweighs the side effects of the pill. The male pill has side effects but since men do not become pregnant there is no risk of harm if they don‚Äôt take them, that‚Äôs why they can‚Äôt be approved for sale.
73. Not accurate Hormone blockers reduce suicide attempts dramatically and give young people time to come to terms with their identity without making permanent decisions. No minors are having surgical interventions. Just isn't even a consideration. Some continue, some don't - but they're alive and have the choice thankfully. As someone in healthcare, the only agenda is reducing harm. Please don't believe the propaganda, it's nothing like the fear mongering nonsense out there.
74. It‚Äôs not science transgenders have by far higher suicide rates than anyone else. It‚Äôs 100% bleeding heart politics.
75. I'm sure there are plenty of legitimate medical rather than psychological reasons to intervene medically. If someone is not old enough to vote or marry or have tattoos, what in the world makes anyone think that they will be able to decide better at age 10 or 12 or 18(if their development has been interrupted) about what their biology is meant to be. There is no way to change your DNA. None. Somethings we have to accept as reality. If someone who is of sound mind and of age decides to change their gender, that is their business. Children is another story. If the law will protect them against alcohol and sigarets, it should protect them against harmful medical treatment as well.
76. So i've been looking at sat maps and terrain maps etc of the area and i just can't fathom why this road is even in plan to begin with. Unless something has dramatically changed over the last 4 years (and well, a lot has i guess) but in that area specifically, why is there such a high demand to drive from caboolture to beerburrum? Unless you live in the glasshouse mountains area, there's not much reason to go there a lot. Sure, a few times for touristy things, or maybe a weekend trip etc, but that doesn't need a new highway. Did they build new housing estates up that way that i'm not familiar with so that people who live up there can drive to north brisbane/caboolture for work? And if so, what's wrong with the existing roads and bruce highway? Has there been a dramatic population boom in the sunshine coast? I know they were building a bunch of new estates when i moved away, but that wasn't enough for this.
77. So people voted to have their belongings stolen every week by different groups of people? Cool, yes, very smart and rational.
78. My point exactly, being fed at school is an incentive to go for some of these kids. Which keeps them off the streets and not committing crimes, plus you know kids deserve to be fed regardless of their parents ability to parent and or feed them
79. I'm not going to continue to argue a point with you if you refuse to see the reality that some people genuinely do not have the money to spend on lunch. I had mates growing up who's parents would scrimp and save like there was no tomorrow just to afford rent, bills and a meal on the table most nights. Sometimes they had sleep for dinner. It sounds like you have come from a privileged background and if that's the case I'm glad you have not had to experience that sort of poverty. The point I was trying to make is regardless of a parents choices a child deserves to be fed. They have done nothing to deserve the hand they've been dealt and saying that they deserve to go hungry because of their parents choices is pretty horrible.
80. Cool, even if that were the actual end-all case, why do the kids deserve to go hungry because they have shitty parents? Also, show me where the LNP has addressed this concern? What will they do, lock the kids up?
