Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Wouldn't it be ideal if some force like gravity could be harnessed to generate electricity day round?
2. You missed the point. The coal and gas subsidise solar and wind. Once intalled, the renewables are cheap power. But only when they run. Which means when they run, coal and gas are still operating, being maintained but not producing in order to kick on when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesnt shine. They still need to maintain the potential for taking up the slack from renewables which is expensive. That downtime is costly and the more renewables there are, the less utilised they will be during a sunny or windy day, yet never be able to be decommissioned without storage options or another, better way of generating baseload power. More renewables drive up the price of power in this way. They still incur costs when they produce less power and you can't overload the grid with power. So they have to recoup costs when they do run and have less competition to boot, so higher bid. Renewables aren't consistent enough to shutter fossil fuel plants but they are cheap to run and cost little when they're off. They can't be turned on or off to meet demand, scaled up or down quickly. They are a bit of bonus power on a hot day or good to pump water for stored hydro, but will never be suitable to base a whole grid on. Please, go do some reading about how bad the euro power grid is and how reliant theyve become on french nuclear facilities.
3. >gas are still operating, Not gas, combined or open cycle have no problem starting snd stopping each day. Just very expensive to run. >So they have to recoup costs when they do run and have less competition to boot, so higher bid. Which is just a roundabout way of saying their more expensive. In our competitive bid system high input cost/ slow response generation like coal is always going struggle. That's why no private sources are clamouring to build new coal power stations, just lose money.
4. But your renewables are not every going to replace them. They just make them less efficient and the fossil fuel plants make more power. Creating inefficiencies is whats driving up the cost. At this point you're being wilfully ignorant. You're purposefully ignoring the glaring issues with solar and wind because of whatever indoctrination you've withstood. Free your mind and think a little. If anyone was serious about clean energy, they'd be building nuclear plants on the sites of end of life coal plants. Clearly the lefties just want to fuck up our country more than they already have and refuse to learn the lessons Europe and the US already have. Im out at this point.
5. I notice Channel Nine has stopped reporting on the youth crime epidemic. There's a non-problem solved already.
6. They didn’t actually promise much, they kept their whole platform pretty ephemeral. Allow developer donations, change preferential voting, stop taxing coal companies, end a “youth crime wave” that by all metrics doesn’t really exist…
7. I think the fact that people are whinging about you whinging without providing policies or meaningful discussion speaks volumes about the LNP and their voter base.
8. Is this a mobile app thing or what? Your title implies you have posted a list or a link to the list, but instead just a whinge. So do you have facts or is this /r just going to be wringing from now on?
9. Mate. Look at the figures. It wasn’t close! ALP’s worst election since 2014 and before that in 1908. The LNP have been on for 2 days! FFS.
10. One of the promises should be to stop Labor supporters whining on social media days after the election…
11. It's tagged as a question. Sorry for the confusion. Not whinging. I accept it. It's part of democracy. I'm just concerned with the pace they are backtracking.
12. Yes you are right, I didn't actually check my spelling and guess that auto correct messed up too.
13. It’s really more about how close the margin is in many of those seats. I will agree that LNP seems to have a good overall lead on ALP of about 10% But I don’t think it’s a strong clear mandate to go full steam.
14. Is it? It's actually looking like either an 11 seat majority of maybe 13 seat majority at the moment. It's the total number of LNP MPs (likely to be either 52 or 53) minus all others (40 or 41). I also don't remember people saying the previous 2020 election was some blowout victory for the ALP either though and it was almost the same result reversed. Was this just because it was during the pandemic and distracted or - more likely - reflected media framing at the time?
15. Feel free to list their promises… You seem to have much conviction in the party. Please indulge us in your understanding such that we may scrutinise over the next 100 days. You shouldn’t have anything to worry about since what the party has said will be what they deliver undoubtedly
16. And it's taken them two days to flip on one and start backtracking on another. Are we not to be concerned? Maybe I voted LNP only because of these promises? Should we not hold them to account like they said we should?
17. I mean, you say this like the ALP hasn't only been out of office a couple of times since 1989 (with decades of National government before that and a very different political environment making comparisons a bit irrelevant). It's a bit of a pointless historical statistic. I mean the 2020 results were pretty calamitous for the LNP (almost the reverse of this election) and I didn't hear these kind of hyperbolic takes at the time. For good reason too, because it was still close enough to be returned at the next election.
18. Agree on the 2 days though. Judge after a few weeks, if not months, at least.
19. Mate, these Labor faithful can’t think straight, they’ve been on meth since the election to drown their sorrows
20. I'd really like the other party supporters to stop the whining about Labor supporters whining, guess its whining all the way down or turtles idk fuck you
21. I'm not whining. The LNP won. But it won't using a small target strategy (all parties do it - we have ourselves to blame) and is obviously going to walk back some of its more moderate promises... See the op. Is it wrong to hold them to account?
22. Suppression of free speech? Not surprised that you support that as an LNP supporter though.
23. Yeah I voted labor but this entire subreddit has been full of whinging it’s quite sad honestly
24. Their 100 day commitment also outlines things for health and the aged abuse enquiry which Labor retreated from
25. If all they can do is attack your spelling, they've got nothing to fight you with and have thrown a tantrum. Don't waste time with them.
26. Yep, going to be a lot of seats requiring 1-2% swings next time. It's likely the ALP will need to win about 10 seats for government in 2028 with many seats in that range. If the LNP govern moderately that could be a hard ask, but even a hint of the Newman years will consign them to defeat at the next election.
27. It's basically a reverse of last election results with the lnp slightly ahead on first preferences, 2PP and seat total.
28. Nothing wrong with that, it was a tongue in cheek response, all we are getting a people whining and calling everyone who didn’t vote their way, every name under the Sun. All govt should be held responsible.. just give them a chance
29. It’s not speech it’s whining, typical response from. Labor supporters throw toys out of pram when things don’t go their way.
30. Yep, I can’t see this place making any LNP voter feel bad about a bunch of sore losers on the internet.
31. I think that it determines how reckless they think they can be.
32. Is he? Hmmmmmmm Seems like you, once again, have no idea what you're talking about. Lololololol
33. I am simply pointing out your lack of self awareness for upvotes my friend, I am how you say on reddit :)
34. I am shocked Remember when KRudd introduced the stages of promises and the only ones he kept were ones labelled "rolled gold" promises
35. I guess you can’t understand. Champ you need to cut down on the pipe
36. Loads of wealthy old people living here who typically vote blue., however I also feels it’s one of those situations where lnp has held the region for so long labor barely even bother campaigning here….The candidate of my electorate for labor was a random who I have never heard of before, while the lnp candidate used to be our local councillor and is extremely active in the community, everyone knows his name etc. I voted labor because I am rusted on, even though I do actually like the lnp candidate for my area. I can see why people who don’t have a strong preference either way vote for the candidate they know from around town. Visible presence in the community seems to be far too low by labor/greens, at least in my electorate
37. Two reasons: 1. The retirees and older crowd. 2. Individualism and hustle culture. I'll expand on the second. Due to tourism the GC is full of businesses. It's also popular with performers, influencers, etc. Lots of people that are both (a) self employed and (b) have belief they'll be successful and rich. Hustle mindset. That mindset, and being pro-business, is pro-LNP. These people hate government regulation, many don't want wages or benefits for employees to go up, and none want excessive regulations on their work.
38. Scanlon is going to hold onto Gaven which is at least something.
39. It's full of wealthy boomers, bikies, influencers, con men and real estate agents.
40. The real reason is that gold coast, is tourism/business orientated city. you have alot of landlord. business owners and retirees. That prefer the LNP policies. I remember there being an issue with southport cruise port that turned alot of people away from labor. Also labor just doesn't try when it comes to trying to win them over. That is a very safe-seat problem.
41. A city full of narcissists voting for a party whose modus operandi is to enrich themselves at the expense of others is hardly surprising.
42. That’s where all the Spivs and Grifters hang out. Them and the LNP are a natural fit.
43. It’s the Florida of Australia. Yeah, they forgot to look at what’s happening to Florida.
44. Lots of interstate ppl have moved to the gold coast over the last few years, and most wouldn’t have any preconceived ideas or qld party loyalty. When you’ve got Murdoch media constantly bashing the government, no doubt that can’t help but influence your decision.
45. Because it's the Miami of Australia. Corrupt Mayor, fake tits, fake muscles, low education, massive drug use. The calling cards of a right wing strong hold.
46. GC has a higher number of older people (large skew to LNP), small business owners (large shew to LNP) and fewer highly educated younger people (large skew to Labor and Greens). How does this happen? Older people retire here. Successful small-medium business owners make lifestyle choice to live here. Younger people who receive a university degree often leave for Brisbane, Sydney or Melbourne (for at least a few years, or more).
47. It's a bit like the stereotype that people from Gold Coast have gold teeth, big gold chains, small dicks, own jetskis and are where cashed up bogans live.
48. All that unchecked property development on the GC is your answer.
49. Gc has always been very rugged individualist and small business orientated. Because of this, they also have the highest per capita bankruptcies in the country. They're also a bunch of dodgy cunts.
50. So a lot of people have mentioned it, retirees, but none have really explained beyond that, moreso using retirees as interchangeable with boomer. GC is a retirement city, as others have mentioned, like Miami. All Australians from all over the country, typically want to retire to the nice sunny Gold Coast. Of course, many can’t afford it, and they tend to retire close to home or not move at all. Those however that do have the capital to retire and move th GC are rich, GC is an expensive city. So, it is in particular the Gold Coast collecting Australia’s richest old people, from all over the country. Most cities have a natural old population and a natural rich population, Gold Coast does not, it has a concentration of them due to being a retirement city, and both of those demographics lean towards LNP. So the answer of “retiree” is correct, but here’s the full explanation of why them specifically, and why they affect the Gold Coast and not say, Brisbane.
51. Victorians who have moved up here to avoid Dan Andrews/Vic Labor
52. I lived on the Gold Coast from 2019 to 2023. The median age on the Gold Coast is 39, so the whole "OMG Boomers" through this thread is fucking stupid. Labor just don't bother campaigning in the Gold Coast. That's it, the majority of the City of Gold Coast population isn't wealthy elites. You can tell who's never been there beyond the strip. 700,000 people and apparently they're all wealthy 80 year olds.
53. Had old time L and NP reps at state level who boosted development and infrastructure investment, and people remember the good times. Plus, it's closer to the NSW border and northern NSW is a very odd mixture of reactionary and libertarianism. Once you get over the dope smoke from Byron and Mullumbimby, northern NSW is where religious fundamentalists, anti-vaxxers and "tax is a sin against the lord because prince charlie said so in 1793" people hang out. It leaks over the border.
54. I think Gold Coasters just have a lack of political education, most likely vote LNP because thats what their family has always done. They just mimic back what they’ve heard but cant actually go into detail. Lack of critical thinkers, try having a conversation with anyone here about anything other than the weather, surfing, which gym they go too or which private school little Johnny goes too. They look down on people less fortunate than them but donate their shit to make themselves feel superior. They hate young people unless its their own kids, who are just perfect. They think Logan is ghetto, hell they use to think Nerang was ghetto. They’re all pissed most of the time. They just dont care about anything unless it directly affects them. Theres a massive lack of cultural diversity, lots of Poms and South Africans but not a lot of brown people.
55. Lots of old retired folks it used to be … ones that don’t care about anyone else apart from themselves and their money.
56. Live on the GC and you realize quickly it is dominated by grifters, LNP + grifters = match!
57. why is the city of beach side privately owned skyscrapers with multimillion dollar mansions of global shillionaires and LNP stronghold?
58. Where do you think all the rich Boomer Landlords retire to ?
59. Rich boomers who also are sunbirds. Too old to give a shit about reproductive rights, too rich to care about anything other than themselves and their money. Scared of youths. If they care about impacts on their kids and grandkids, they might also live in other states.
60. Surprised no one’s mentioned the volume of churches and Christian’s here too. When I moved it was also the first place I saw a high volume of One Nation supporters Also this place isn’t near as old as some people make it to be. A ton of the people that have moved up are young families or moved for more affordable family lifestyles
61. GC is full of aspiration, aligns more with LNP values
62. Maybe we don't want our taxes to fund primarily Brisbane benefiting policy?
63. As an LNP voter…. I voted labor this election… LNP still went home with the chockies…
64. Boomers, tradies and linen wearing wankers….oh and a fk load of old people.
65. Victorians? Moved there to get away from the progressive? /s
66. most permanent residents of GC are rich retirees or rich people in general, that is why is so blue.
67. More critical thought than the outer suburbs welfare dependent sheep?
68. While I’d generally agree, aren’t there lots of rich people in Brisbane too?
69. What you said definitely applies to the strip and inner suburbs, but the further out you go it changes. There aren’t a whole lot of rich people living in Coomera (the suburb or the Electorate which includes Pimpama and Ormeau), they just tend to live in their own bubbles, or fled here to escape the progressive/greenie agenda they perceive to be taking over the country. They aren’t just fleeing from Brisbane either, they’re coming from Sydney and Melbourne (ironically to escape the cost of living and impossible housing prices) or from other parts of the country looking for economic opportunities, namely investing in the housing market. They see no problem with perpetuating the cycle that pushed them out of their old cities, so long as they’re in front of the cycle. There are so many other historical and social factors that have pushed the Gold Coast so conservative over the years, but I think this is the major factor in the surrounding suburbs.
70. To your point Labor didn’t even bother. Only seen LNP and One Nation signs for weeks here
71. It’s something like that Im in Broadwater and David has held here for ages Labor was someone I didn’t know I still voted Labor (always have) and I prefer their party by a long shot. But that unfortunately isn’t enough for my area, being Retirees that live Liberal and have for so long that Liberal was inevitably getting back in. I must note though In the 8 years he has been in, I nor anyone I know have never seen him in public or heard of him doing anything here. Take that with what you will but for a member the man just got in on the fact that people vote Liberal here at least since Verity Barton.
72. I reckon this is it. I asked the same question of a group the other day, and their LNP members are out getting involved in community, charities, etc, whereas alp and grn candidates are nowhere to be seen. People vote locally, something that we like to forget.
73. Megan works very hard for this electorate, the LNP candidate lives in Brisbane as far as I know. I can’t believe it’s this close but I think a lot of people were do a protest vote.
74. Also another good point, although I know that there is a relatively significant younger population there as well (party capital of Brisbane? Or has that changed on the decade since I was going there all the time too) so with all things I thought there would’ve been a bit more balance
75. If you actually believe that boomers are the only reason the Gold Coast is conservative, you’re a fool. The Gold Coast (and QLD as a whole), has a fairly substantial amount of young conservative people. The problem is, if they ever come out as a conservative, the intolerant left like everyone on this subreddit recently will socially ostracise them. This is why you don’t realise how many actually conservative people there are out there. None of this matters when they get to the ballot box though, which is why the vote comes back Blue
76. What the Cruise Terminal that **Tom Tate** has been bitching about wanting for 8 years now?
77. Quick google confirms narcissism is only at 0.5/1.0% of the population. It’s a nice throwaway term, but not relevant to this topic.
78. And the GC is basically Miami. Hell, even one of the suburbs is called Miami for shits and giggles.
79. Maybe I’m getting old but you’re the second person to say something along these lines and like, what does it mean 😬
80. Someone over 78 is not a Boomer and I can guarantee they are far more conservative than the Boomer generation who grew up in the 60/70’s and there’s plenty of them on the Gold Coast. Narcissism is less than 1% of the population, try again.
81. In Bonney we were bombarded by LNP propaganda mail drops and addressed mail. Not a peep out of any of the other parties. I still don't know what any LNP policies are, but I know they aren't Labor.
82. Followed closely by the rich kids of rich old people.
83. Nah it’s really old people who think they are rich cause they have a jet ski but are really drowning in debt.
84. But the ones who are afraid of liberal cities and "filthy greenies" all move to the boomer belt that is the GC (and rent out their brisbane city apts)
85. You have to have around $1m to buy in Pimpama/ Coomera now so there is def "rich" people there. It has been inundated with wealthy boomers/NSW migration of the last couple of years too
86. Just seems odd, all of the benefits that *seemed* to win brisbane over (cheaper fares, energy rebates etc) didn’t seem to leave a mark on anything south of Logan-ish; I would’ve thought that they would’ve tried at least
87. He was a slimy little grub back in his days as a councillor in Townsville, so I’m honestly not surprised he fell upwards into a safe seat on the Gold Coast once he was kicked out in the 2015 election
88. Hervey bay was the same. 10% swing to LNP, Adrian Tantari was never seen or heard the entire time he held office and come election time Labor community involvement was outnumbered ten to one. I voted early and was honestly shocked at the sheer number of blue shirts handing out flyers compared to red
89. She's my local member and I vote for her as well, I shook her hand and thanked her for the hard work and wished her luck while she was standing out in the hot sun all day in a carpark last week when I voted early. She had a couple of other helpers handing out but they were outnumbered 3 to 4 to one by Bianca Stone and the LNP team. She did well to fight off such a big campaign and a big overall swing against the ALP. That proves she does has a solid support base for the good work she has done. I dunno where she sits factionally in the ALP but she's young and is marked by the party for leadership so who knows she could be Premier one day.
90. The qld labor party has lost 2 elections in the past 30 odd years though haven’t they? Bit rich to say that its “the intolerant left” when they’ve been in power for longer than I’ve been alive :/
91. Boomers take up the largest demographic portion of our population and it’s an even larger disparity in regions like the GC. Couple that with Gen X who have similar voting preferences and you get results such as what OP is talking about
92. The quarter of a million in Australia must have all moved there.
93. Back in the Joh era they were called "the white shoe brigade". The fashion of the day for the well off conservative gentleman was shorts, knee high white socks and white shoes.
94. Narcissim on the GC less than 1%? Haven't had a laugh that good in years
95. I mean.... in that basis, the only difference between them and you is that they have a jet ski.
96. There are Kiwis here but it’s far from all Kiwi. Not that that would disqualify them from my original point. Just add Auckland and Wellington and Christchurch to the list
97. People will vote against their self interest when they see a familiar face any day of the week, my dad for example is 75, on the pension and has a million health problems, should be the last person on earth to vote lnp yet he did, and his words were that even though he doesn’t agree with the lnp policies, he voted for them because he knows the local candidate because she comes and has a drink with him and “the boys” at the local pub, while he doesn’t know the other one from a bar of soap…I imagine he is not in the minority of thinkers, as terrifying as that is
98. What can I say, ppl down here prefer kids in prison. Now, but on the back of an abortion ban, even more so in 15 years from now.
99. Rich people don't use PT and they're still getting 40c/kWh off their solar.
100. Read this subreddit and you’ll find plenty of evidence of the intolerant left. Although QLD Labor has lost 2 elections in the last 30 years, the Gold Coast has always been an LNP stronghold
101. Interestingly, around the world they’re finding that Gen Z is one of the most conservative generations in their youth that we’ve ever seen
102. I also don’t live on the GC so a win for me there.
103. Hello, my name is Coke Pingers & I approve this message.
