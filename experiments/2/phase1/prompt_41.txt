Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. You’re allowed to have emotions. You are also wrong in believing that the LNP’s plans to jail children will ~~import~~ improve that, it’ll likely make it worse. Your vote was a vote to increase recidivism, and create more victims of crime. Edit: typo
2. I'm hoping you're replying to me here. You've thought nothing about the financial implications of an LNP vote, especially on resourcing public services but that's ok. You've got your own. Crime is a social problem, it doesn't get solved by throwing people in jail, it just transfers the problem for a while. Last time this mob was in they destroyed the crime prevention space, you know, things that have success in minimising crime while enriching their mates with boot camps etc. Seeing the Liberals are the party of personal responsibility, be responsible for the security of your own home. Good luck when the cuts inevitably happen, because those CFMEU folks you complained about have strength like all unions. You'll be on your own, but hey, have a dig at the group that forced employers in your industry to have safety standards. I'm sure you'd much rather the construction conditions in Qatar or Bangladesh... You're allowed to have your opinion, sure. Just don't pick on the opinions that point out how wrong you are.
3. Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. By a year prior, Bayer-Monsanto already owned a half of Ukraine’s agricultural sector, Zelensky having made foreign ownership legal only a year prior (to that). But the main proximate reason Russia invaded was NATO involvement in Ukraine’s military since 2014, and especially the increase in skirmishes and troop movements since the US pulled out of Afghanistan (Aug 2021). America has occupied the oil-producing third of Syria since 2016 or so, and that is Israel’s main source of oil besides postwar Iraq. Gaza sits on a lot of oil and gas, and Hamas was helped into ruling the place because the Palestinian Authority had negotiated exploration deals, since taken over by Israel, years ago. There are other reasons they want Gaza, but that and building an alternative to the Suez Canal are the main ones.
4. They were popular... And they could have also gone after youth crime. But here we are.
5. Newman sold 11 billion worth of assets during his term and went to the second election intending to sell 37 billion more
6. We could argue about definitions of life, human, baby til the cows come home (& scientists do), but at the end of the day we don't even expect our dead to donate organs if they don't want to, no matter how many lives they could save. I have O+ blood with no weird clotting factors, I get emails from the red cross all the time. No-one's shown up to my door with an arrest warrant - & that's half an afternoon and about half a litre of blood. Why is the uterus any different?
7. At what week gestation do you consider them as a 'baby'?
8. Call it what you like, it’s still a human being in the eyes of many.
9. Trying to income test people to see who needs it would cost more than just making it available for everyone
10. I was talking about inflation? Injecting more money is not the solution to inflation.
11. I'm firmly hovering between the Labour and Greens on policy, and even I can admit Friendlyjordies isn't the most objective source, especially when you're talking to liberals, just mentioning him is gonna keep a lot of people from reading the rest of whatever you say.
12. 100% this. And now watch as the media stops showing any security footage of this youth crime issue overnight. Just like federal LNP and the boats, if it’s not reported on it doesn’t happen
13. They aren’t. You just don’t agree with other people. Life isn’t just about the two issues you mention. Only a very small brain would suggest as much.
14. Oh, yeah, I get that now, I was more speaking in a retrospective sense given that's when I was following him at his most "honest" I guess? When he started to shift from saying "the greens are fine but their base needs to chill" to "The Greens can't govern, just Vote Labor" that's when I tuned out 'cause that's when I knew he drunk the "only labor" koolaid,
15. Do you or your immediate family own a mining company?
16. Well, I doubt they're reducing payroll taxes, so you'd probably have to own a mining company or have shares in them to benefit from the removal of mining royalties.
17. I don't see anyone that's isn't a corporation benefiting from anything this government has planned. I'm glad I'm not a public servant right now. I was during Newman, and that was horrendous. It's like people think the leader of the party determines what the party stands for even though it's the complete opposite.
18. Own at least one property. Have shares in coal mining.
19. If you qualify for private banking right now, you’ll come out on top.
20. 7 figures plus whatever you get from your investment properties.
21. I don't think the average punter is going to experience too much in that regard. You'd have to be paying payroll tax or subject to mining royalties mostly. Company owners and private enterprise could be seeing some dollars coming their way as I'm pretty sure they already said would outsource youth facilities as part of their youth justice crack down. Average Joe on wages earning less than couple hundred thousand a year prob won't experience much. Public service probably getting some cuts through natural attrition and not backfilling roles and potential outsourcing of some functions. That's my guess
22. I dunno, but I'm seriously contemplating ~~increased~~ ~~premium~~ differential pricing for known LNP supporters. Gotta do my part to help them with the cost of living.
23. To suggest that the LNP don't care about all citizens is ludicrous.
24. If you buy a house right now you’ll only pay stamp duty not life long annual land taxes !
25. Your hero is using tax dollars to give everyone a thousand dollar cheque - non means tested And you’re here bleating about LNP You people are beyond help
26. And whining continues.Probably best to accept reality and move on.
27. $0. You’ll always get more money from the government when you don’t work than when you do. Checkmate.
28. Oh FFS. You lost the election. Get over it and spare us all the moaning.
29. Most people own shares in mining companies through their super.
30. Yes, that is a ludicrous statement. The LNP doesn’t care about *any* citizens.
31. To be fair the OP didn't say "care", they said "benefit".
32. Crisafulli voted against abortion so that’s at least half the population right there
33. Well, for starters they clearly don’t care about women. Nor do they care about children, as they were/are opposed to Miles’ free school lunches. They also don’t care about people struggling with the cost of living as they opposed 50¢ fares.
34. The two major parties care about people who are likely to vote for them
35. Well I hope we all see a 1% bump on our pension in 40-60 years time
36. They promised to reduce the cost of living, they're reducing coal royalties, so you can eat as much coal as you like on the cheap.
37. I'd actually disagree strongly with this. The LNP give zero fucks about regional Queensland. Regional Queensland, as a voting base, are just very gullible and have Sky fed to them for free.
38. Instead of pointing out youth crime stats and saying it's lower. labor and greens should have said: There are still areas with high rate of youth crime, to solve this we intend to ....
39. There’s already an attitude in NQ that they’re forgotten and fuck SEQ, was there an effort to engage with those communities pre election to offer community youth programs , sport skills days or holiday programs , graffiti community walls, cook outs etc to try and give youth a different lane? Anything to show there was a real attempt at hearing how bad the crime feels in those specific areas? Genuinely curious. It was a missed opportunity to say we hear you our plan xyz will help. Although the statistics say crime is down, personally I do feel safer than I did 10 years ago. That just isn’t everyone’s reality in this state which is fair. It did seem for the most part it was an avoided subject and people unfortunately went with tough on crime to make them feel safer whether they’re in a safe community or not. Media and social media saturation of course amplifies those feelings of “danger”.
40. I think that ALP not having a stance on it was fucking stupid. Might’ve been blown out of proportion by the media, but it obviously meant a lot to a lot of Qld’ers.
41. I work all the way along the north coast of QLD to Cooktown. It’s certainly a problem and It’s a regular topic of discussion with the locals. Ignoring it won’t make it go away.
42. And now in a few weeks it'll disappear from the news and then they can claim they did something about it when in fact they just stopped caring
43. IMO it was both the youth crime issue and labor’s response to it (and responses like yours on it). The stats pretty clearly show that youth crime has decreased in qld, but qld is a biggg state. It has decreased nicely in Brisbane, but outside of Brisbane, and in some key towns it’s a completely different story. So you have these people living in towns where youth crime is sky rocketing, looking at the ALP and some media who are telling them they are wrong. They then look at comments etc like yours where you say ‘the perception’. Then they get really angry, because it’s not just a perception, it’s very real for them. It is increasing in their area. Maybe they have been directly impacted, or someone they know. But everyone in brisbane is going ‘no no no, it’s fine here, look at this broad statistic where your little town is insignificant, stop lying’, so they vote for the only major party that is at least pretending to give a shit about them, the LNP.
44. Youth crime was a lot of people's equivalent of the abortion issue in the sense that they just couldn't trust the other side's position on it.
45. Yeah it was a manufactured outrage on the monopoly media. You couldn’t turn on the TV without it starting with “youth crime wave” or “crime out of control” and then show a single incident recorded on a Doorbell camera. It’s not hard to find one youth committing a crime out of a population of 5.2 million but by showing those rare isolated incidents as if it was a growing trend (the opposite is true) tricked people into thinking it was a real issue and also Labor’s fault.
46. I don’t think it was that. I think it’s more of a message to federal Labor. Albanese is seriously disliked among a growing majority. The fact that Peter Dutton is level in the polls, after the Morrison government, speaks volumes.
47. It appears that outright dismissing people's concerns over a very real issue they are facing is not a great way to win an election.
48. I’m actually not seeing youth crime where I live. It’s just adult crime. Adults stealing our parcels or breaking into the garage.
49. Until there are true consequences imposed by judges, not a lot is going to change. The issue is complex, multi-layered and involves everyone from parents, through to police. Without respect for the law and there being little to no consequences, we will see this continue to escalate.
50. Have they announced anything on adult crime? I keep hearing about businesses being broken into, especially in the outer suburbs, West End etc. Drug trafficking/manufacturing? The city is crawling with junkies screaming at people.
51. I think the deciding factor was people making it very clear what they care about and Labor went.... "Naaah"
52. Anyone who has spent more than a few days in Townsville knows that youth crime is very much a problem. Obviously LNP's "solutions" are pretty shit, but it doesn't change the fact that ALP didn't mention it at all aside from saying "it's not a problem". Big mistake on ALP's part - they should have addressed it and offered solutions.
53. The feeling on the ground is it’s up, not down as the stats suggest. Anecdotally, people see crime worse around them and they don’t feel safe. Especially those with young families. This is a serious issue and the LNP played that card very well. The main issue now is that they are only throwing a tiny amount of money at it, and they don’t have anywhere to house anyone they have said will do adult time for adult crime.
54. Give it 6 months and Qldrs will finally wake up and realise that the LNP has no answers to issues such as youth crime, ambulance ramping and the cost of living. The new Olympic stadium will be in Victoria Park, the Olympic accommodation in Hamilton and all designed to help their white shoe developer mates. Nothing in the Gabba will change for the next decade, even though it's the best option, with transport at the door and now with the local Greenies base totally wiped out. God help Qld
55. Preparing my shocked pikachu face for the study in four years time that reveals Youth Crime statistics haven't changed at all under the LNP because the party is totally unwilling to do anything about any of the social issues that actually cause Youth Crime.
56. Is it true that the son of the LNP candidate for Capalaba was killed by a repeat youth offender, and the sitting Labor member called youth crime a 'media beat-up' in response?
57. I know Townsville people are "fed up" with crime - that was a huge factor here.
58. “I believe crime has not become worse” that’s just nonsense. People (labor supporters) keep sprouting this like it’s the truth. People only have to look around and read the papers. Mothers and grandmothers being stabbed to death. Things are definitely getting worse. Remember what Mark Twain said about statistics before you quote those to us.
59. I think alot of people on reddit dont realise why boomers are so concerned by youth crime. They're all going through their grey nomad phase, all they talk about atm is what wild shit they saw some abouriginal kid do while on their camping trip to where ever they went
60. The thought that youth crime has increased is cherry picking https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-25/youth-crime-statistics-using-data-incorrectly/104488958
61. I guarantee “youth crime” will stop being reported on by majority of news networks now the lnp are in.
62. As someone who worked in a booth yesterday it was disappointing to hear the number of people that asked “which one is getting tough on youth crime?” They clearly knew the buttons to push to trigger voters and their campaign was enough to get them over the line. Maybe one day we’ll have an informed electorate that expects more from our politicians
63. I absolutely agree how the campaign team got this so wrong when the focus should have been opposing DC’s strategy why it won’t work and labours stance on it there’s even research debunking his strategy very odd campaign team
64. unfortunately they will do nothing its such a tough one while its only a tiny fragment of the population who are committing the serious crimes they are being set out on bail. understandably bail laws should be soft for the boy caught selling grams of weed at school or the girl who gets popped w a bag full of unpaid cosmetic stuff. but violence and serious theft such as house breaking, car theft, weapon possession ect fuck em I was a shit of a kid, I grew up alright but had a heap of issues. I fucking get it. I had a stable home , good suburb all of that and still was a teenage addict. kids def need compassion. but the real shits. like the violent ones. the ram raid ones. the home invasion ones. the ones w blades. fuck them.
65. Actually having a plan to address it wouldn't have done anything. Unfortunately a huge chunk of people don't want to see the issues solved, they want to see punishment, whether it works or not
66. I agree with you, and I think a proactive and progressive approach is far better than something reactive like jailing kids. Unfortunately the people who have to deal with youth crime in places like Townsville don’t want to wait around, they just want the problem solved. Throwing a kid in jail does exactly that. The reality too is that a lot of these offenders have trauma or are victims of some kind of abuse, so they may go on to perpetuate the cycle in their own kids without any intervention or help. So any progressive solutions can take a very long time to be realised in society.
67. The ridiculous thing is, I live on the Fraser Coast and as of 2023 we were getting a major upgrade to our police station in addition to more personnel. Didn’t hear any of that from Labor or the media though.
68. crime going down statistics is weird set of cherry picking. The actual stats are all over the place and it hard to make a story up one way or the other. There is same physical number of youth committing crime (less per capita then 10 years ago) but they are committing more crime 3.9 vs 2.7 offences and on alot more unique victums. Crime rates in regionals towns have increased and not just the ones related to DV. I grew up in logan in the 90's I would say there was more crime than now, but the type of crimes and victums were different. They weren't as random, and alot less people carried knifes. I won't say the police aren't doing anything, all of last term police were at the major trains and bus stations in my area from 3-4. Wanding all non-uniform teens(still not sure how that legal) and they had quite a collection of knifes the first few times. After that the teens stop showing up.
69. > It’s certainly a problem and It’s a regular topic of discussion with the locals. It's a discussion in plenty of places, that doesn't mean it's an actual legitimate problem however, were you to read the average suburbs facebook group you'd think we live in a war torn hellhole, whereas in reality there's absolutely crime but it's not even remotely close to some epidemic and voting for those who plan to do the very thing that has always been shown to make crime worse is just fucking daft.
70. You needed to look at more stories. Lots of the stuff from NQ was pretty shocking. I don’t care if it had just been one cop car stolen and taken for a joy ride (it was more), things have to be pretty bad already to become that lawless.
71. Not for the people in Nth Queensland. Stealing cars is really bad up there to the point where a family member put cameras up and has seen 3 kids trying to to get into the house while they are at work, during the day, this year. I think people in SEQ don’t realise how bad it is up there. Is LNP the answer, of course not but people up there haven’t seem any change and are looking for a quick fix, which I doubt they will get but it didn’t stop them voting against labour because of it.
72. As someone who is born and raised in Mount Isa and now lives in Brisbane, let me assure you of something. Youth crime is a rare and isolated thing in Brisbane. It is a regular near daily occurrence in Mount Isa. Do yourself a Favour and actually spend time talking to people living in the regions before you go dismissing there lived realities.
73. Thee was also the factor that Crisafulli turned victims of Youth Crime into his political props. Once he started bringing victims to tell their stories to his press conferences, the Labor Government couldn't regain control of the narrative, emotion had taken over. No amount of stat waving or Police Commissioners stating otherwise was going to shift the topic out the emotional perspective. It's not the victims families fault, what happened to them was a tragedy and I completely understand that they want justice for what was done to them. But, going on Prime time television with the opposition leader to attack a government which doesn't have control over people in the way voters think it does was just pure exploitation. It just shows how morally bankrupt the Queensland media landscape is when they continually allowed it to happen again and again. If you're from a southern state, expect this tactic to be used in your neck of the woods soon enough because honestly it's pretty effective.
74. You can quote whatever stats you want, but it doesn’t hit hard till it’s your house or in my case right next door.
75. The rise in the affordability of those doorbell cameras means the news always has footage to run with. That perpetuates the purchase of the cameras.
76. The media will always sensationalise heated topics, unfortunately. A good political team will know best how to address and navigate the issue. A good voter should do their due diligence and become more informed.
77. Albo & Swan definitely need to adapt their plans for next year. They need to make people forget Albo is PM, while having a new public face doing most of the campaigning imo.
78. I agree, but I also don't believe the LNP will fix anything anyone can say buzz words Adult Crime, Adult Time. Putting kids / youth into prison won't fix anything it, In fact jailing kids often makes them worse and serial offenders. But I guess we just have to see what happens.
79. Unfortunately, regional Qld has lots of young people doing dodgy crap, maybe it is recency bias, but it feels like there is more serious crime from young people with reports that they are out on bail or behaviour deals before more significant events. I think in the city it is easier to let the numbers be part of the very small crime crowd, but in small towns each incident has weight and significance to the broader community as everyone is a little more connected. I don't know the answer, but I don't think LNP is it. Just starting to see why this is weighing on a lot of communities in Qld in spite of all the other policy issues around
80. >Until there are true consequences imposed by judges, not a lot is going to change. Until there are consequences imposed ON judges ...... Police arrest them, Judges go easy on them.... the Premier tries to walk a middle ground between Judges interpretation of appropriate sentencing and Public and victim expectations.... but gets blamed.
81. It isn't a case of "waking up". The people who voted LNP because of this issue want "out of sight, out of mind". Locking kids up isn't a problem as long as it's not *their* kids, and the problem is invisible. Harm reduction or solving root causes isn't what they think they're getting from the LNP. "Just make it go away, don't care how as long as it doesn't affect me".
82. Oh it will have changed. It won't have gone *down* but it will have *changed*.
83. This is not to downplay regional crime issues but in this scenario of a grey nomad is it more or less; stereotypically boomers tend to have lived a fairly sheltered life, they then venture out expecting a romanticised version of aus, whilst grey nomading and get hit with reality of how people actually live out in communities? These are the same people that cross the street when they see a black fella and we’re supposed to absorb their fear? When they’ve come from mostly white towns they tend to have a culture shock. Just surmising and what not.
84. Show me region data that's says NQ is down. It's not for general crime rates, verifiable via the QPS statistics site, even though the media and reddit tried gaslighting me because 'statewide' it's down.
85. There are bright sides on Labor's campaign but it wasn't just enough. The greens campaign was a shitshow disaster on the other hand
86. But it’s not about just the campaign. This has been an issue for years. The ALP could have done something ages ago and neutralised the issue all together.
87. Unfortunately trauma informed care isn't as exciting to them as publicly whipping an 11 year old.
88. Absolutely, if folks actually cared about seeing the issue solved, they'd have voted for the Greens who actually had a set of policy that would address the issue properly - https://greens.org.au/qld/policies/youth-justice Trouble is that doesn't feel good to the average voter who just want to see others suffer because they've been conditioned to strip the humanity from anyone they don't like.
89. The thing is if things get stolen from you, yes, you want the offender get punished but the main thing is something got stolen, if the government gives a bit of assistance to financially recover from crime, they might be less out for blood and more open to those kind of approach
