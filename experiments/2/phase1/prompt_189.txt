Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. So how is the LNP the biggest offender for high immigration? Did you see the actual net number of new immigrants in Australia since the ALP came in power? Last time I checked, it was around 2.5x what the Libs brought in. Some research is due. Go check on the ABS website. Australia is one of the richest countries in the world. Even the poorest of us are much better off than the majority of the world. Yes, we are all in the top 5% of the world's richest. How? By big business doing well. Go look at countries that don't have many big businesses that are doing well and ask yourself if you want to live there.
2. There was more than a billion dollars that went into that. Quite simply increasing solar subsidies would have done that. It could have gone towards one of the massive pumped storage dams, etc. The problem with the Left is that it thrives on short term sugar hits. Give us some money now and we will vote for you.
3. OK, so you are suggesting the US or Russia or some other country interefered with elections in the USA, Australia, Canada, the UK and France to install left-wing governments, which have lead to mass immigration and the decay of society. Sure, I can go with that. It would be silly to think there is no interference in elections from overseas adversaries. If you look at how social media is biased, it is a given.
4. 🤣 Russ Hinze, who diverted a highway to go past a bottle shop he owned… 🤦‍♂️
5. You suggested indefinite sentences for these people were a bad thing…yes it’s expensive, but some people don’t deserve to be amongst the community.
6. You cant remember what he told you ? Or did he just say he did good things, you ask no further questions and started repeating it like it's a real thing? Are you stupid ?
7. Actually would get used today if they had the balls
8. Of course he did you clown.. typical Labor re-write history… I was there you clown
9. Because they are all clowns, and think Labor did everything..
10. If we took what we should form mining and foreign companies, we could have a substantial sovereign wealth fund to support our economy.
11. Labor literally deregister the CFMEU and long ago brought in anti association laws to stop bikies in Qld. LNP want to lift the ban on developers "donating" to it and local government.
12. The CFMEU were the only union getting meaningful pay and condition improvements through EBA processes and it turned out that the secret ingredient was crime. Everyone else is getting pay increases below the rate of inflation (I.e., an effective pay cut) in exchange for worsening conditions. The only ones screaming about union "corruption" are the wealthy, because the serfs have the temerity to look at this situation and ask how it's fair.
13. So... why are the LNP expanding government powers, particularly where they encroach on minorities, and expanding the departments that will allow them to enforce this? Facism is a far right phenomenon. And the LNP trends further in that direction every day.
14. Famously, no conservative government in the United States has _ever_ shrank government. The idea that conservatives want small government doesn’t line up with what conservative politicians actually do, when when conservatives do shrink government, it’s often because they don’t understand what that part of the government does and then the collapse everything, ie, Argentina. I would be surprised if Australia was any different. Has Liberal ever actually shrunk government? And conservatives don’t believe in personal rights and such, they believe in _their_ personal rights, as in just theirs, others can get fucked. A fascist government can easily win the support of conservatives by promising the security of their current rights while they go about crushing everyone else. Afterall, Germany’s non-Jewish wealthy elite did just fine living under the Nazi regime.
15. Which groups do the Greens want to oppress? Remembering that a key part of fascism is oppressing the rights of groups for personal gain?
16. I don’t read or watch or listen to any “US media” but nice try champ. Also republicans want a smaller less intrusive government? Hilarious! Unless you mean “smaller” as in “less actual employees in the public service, with all of their work piled on others who remain or outsourced to consulting firms” and a good old serve of “privatisation of entire state-run industries”. And I’m guessing by “less intrusive” you actually mean “less regulation for big business but way way way more intrusive into the personal reproductive rights of women”.
17. You didn't get to my second paragraph. Ah well. Have a good life
18. Covid created a backlog of visas that led to a spike in migration after border restrictions were relaxed, with the majority being temporary visa holders - of course, they were always going to spike post Covid, particularly with returning and new student enrols. However, if you average out the figures from 2020 onwards, temporary migration was ~280k per annum, considerably less than previous years. Prior to Covid, numbers were increasing year on year, with the largest per annum figure of 350k in 2018-2019. Permanent migration between 2021-2023 has been ~75k per annum, which has been considerably less than every previous year since 2012 bar 2019-2021. The largest intake was in 2016-2017 of 106k. So yes the migration numbers during the Coalition years have been considerably higher. I don’t understand your point about big businesses? Of course you need businesses to support the economy, but you also equally need to support workers too. The two go hand in hand. Australia has some of the most concentrated markets in the world when it comes to media, energy, banking, telecommunications, supermarkets (Colesworth) etc. - there’s absolutely a reason why inflation in Australia is currently one of the worst in the developed world. You simply cannot let big businesses run wild, as they have no interest in protecting the general population.
19. I don’t think 1 billion would come close to paying for pumped storage dam.
20. Blanket sentences being indefinite setences absolutely. Courts coming together to place a whole life order on someone after they've been sentenced for those crimes who show no sign of rehabilitation? Absolutely. It happens in the UK, and I think it should be considered here also for extremely dangerous members of society. But I do agree with this, there does need to be a serious overhaul of sentencing etc re those crimes. https://www.aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/tandi628 This is from 2021 Despite a large body of international evidence, Dowling and colleagues’ (forthcoming) review located only three Australian studies (Daly et al. 2013; Goodman-Delahunty & O’Brien 2014; Krone & Smith 2017). Goodman-Delahunty and O’Brien (2014), following offenders referred to a treatment program for an average of around 10 years (SD=4.5 years), found a general reoffending rate of 32 percent, and a non-sexual reoffending rate of 20 percent. Daly and colleagues (2013), following offenders for an average of around four years, found a notably higher general reoffending rate of 54 percent in their sample of juvenile sexual offenders. Consistent with the rest of the studies in Pooley and Dowling’s (forthcoming) review, fewer than 10 percent of offenders in both studies sexually reoffended. The only Australian study to date examining reoffending among CSAM offenders specifically (Krone and Smith 2017) reported findings similar to those of international research. Examining reoffending over an average of about 3.5 years, they found that seven percent sexually reoffended, most (5%) with another CSAM offence, although a smaller proportion escalated to contact or grooming sexual offences (1% each). There is a clear need for further rigorous Australian research examining baseline rates of reoffending among child sexual offenders, particularly CSAM offenders, along with its predictors. There is also a lack of research that compares CSAM offenders with contact and procurement/grooming offenders. This research is critical to informing the scale, implementation and targeting of treatment and criminal justice responses to child sexual offenders, particularly those that assume a high degree of persistence in sexual offending, such as sexual offender registers, indeterminate sentencing regimes, and sexual offender-specific treatment. And this is from 2024 but the sample size is small. Those who get treatment are less likely to reoffend then those who don't. Yet still they are saying we need more research to really know. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13552600.2024.2328052#abstract Our findings highlight a need for more Australian and New Zealand research addressing the recidivism rates post-treatment. More specifically, three future research directives are identified: the need for methodologically strong research, identification of recidivism outcomes for Indigenous young people, and the need for qualitative research to explore the profiles of young people who terminate treatment.
21. Passing comment resulting in my question. You know how that works right? Or is comprehension not your thing? Clown shoes. GTFO halfwit
22. Ok this is the problem with high inflation, everyone goes backwards. Giving everyone more money is not the answer.
23. > So... why are the LNP expanding government powers, particularly where they encroach on minorities. Point me to the policy that the QLD LNP have that is designed to “encroach on minorities” > Facism is a far right phenomenon. And the LNP trends further in that direction every day. Terrible logic here. Do you know what seperates a right wing government in a democracy and a fascist government? If you are suggesting that the LNP, especially a state branch of the LNP, is somehow trending to try and remove democratic process, then you are dreaming.
24. > Famously, no conservative government in the United States has ever shrank government. That is categorically false. It’s very common for conservative candidates to campaign for reduced government spending, and the cutting of red tape and regulations for industry. Small government does not actually mean reducing the number of politicians if that’s what you are getting at. It’s reducing government influence on society, by cutting what is deemed unnecessary government costs, jobs and rules from society.
25. That’s actually not true, fascism believes in the rights of individuals coming second to the perceived good of the nation, and often in the process oppressing the rights of minority groups.
26. If you don’t consume US media then why are your opinions full of their talking points re Trump 🤣🤡
27. If we were building houses and extra production capacity while waiting for our immigration backlog, it would have been sensible. The ALP has simply shown themselves not to be sensible. Or, worse, they brought in the mass of immigrants to prop up the economy. They were desperate to have a budget surplus, and they got it, despite Aussies landing up in tents all over the place. The ALP will be punished severely at the next election for this and they richly deserve it.
28. But it's a billion closer to storing all those renewables we've been building. ;) Even subsidising home batteries would have done a lot in the long run. As it stands, we have people spending, me included, more on coffee or other small, short-term purchases.
29. Everyone who thinks immigration is too high, must be a xenophobe. lol
30. It is when efficiency and profits are also going up. I think you need to look at how shit some EBAs are. There are unions that are only managing to get what amounts to a loss of three percent or more per year in real terms on their pay. Of course, without the union the employer could just reduce everyone to minimum wage, so...
31. They have a weird obsession with winding back LGBTQ rights, they've got candidates who are lifting talking points from Project 2025 around destroying departments (especially the department of education), and they've got the stalking horse KAP willing to aid and abet them in re-criminalising abortion just for a start. Are the LNP facists? Maybe not yet, but they're certainly cribbing from that playbook.
32. It’s very common for conservative candidates to campaign on those things; very rare for them to actually cut government spending is a significant way.
33. Sure, they campaign on that idea but actually research it. Genuinely, I challenge you to look into the history of laws passed by previous governments to see what they genuinely did versus what they said they would. All parties lie, they all make promises they know they can't make but the truth comes out with what they do when they're in power. If you vote LNP because you genuinely believe they're about cost effencies you've been entirely sold a lie.
34. , Nazis were all about "individualism" and obeying leaders. If it was all about the collective good of the state above the individual then Hitler would view himself as the same importance as the grunts, removed the leadership in the means of production, also the leaders of the nazi leadership wouldn't have fled to the USA and south America when Germany fell.
35. And he was sanctioned and everyone was mad and wanted to retake it and then trump won and lifted all sanctions and told everyone that Crimea belonged to the very impressive putin and to stop complaining about it. And now look where we are. Edit: he's even going to do it again if he wins. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=m6nxJZOZdqE
36. Both major parties are absolutely not serious about housing and it’s a travesty. I’m no fan of Labor, but you also have to acknowledge the politics of this as well. They took housing reforms to the 2019 election and lost and the media will continue to crucify them if they don’t deliver on budget surpluses - damned if you do, damned if you don’t. Also, this was my original point about neoliberal economics - suppressing wages, eroding workers rights, and propping up businesses interests through immigration is exactly what neoliberalism is all about. The Liberal party on many occasions have explicitly made this their intention.
37. Yeah look I’m not going to argue online with a union shill that has no idea
38. Thats not what fascism is!!! Fascism is when one person takes power and does not give it up destroying democratic process!! If you don't like those polices, then vote for a different candidate!!
39. I’m not arguing that governments always keeps promises, I’m arguing against the ridiculous claim that no conservative US administration has ever shrunk the government, when it’s quite clear that they do. Shrinking government is things like tax cuts, reduced spending, deregulation but it also includes cutting public services and selling off government assets. Are you seriously going to tell me conservative governments don’t do that?
40. Except again, that’s not true. We know what the characteristics of 1940s German Fascism was, and it’s not how you describe it.
41. Aren't you just proving my point? You are saying the United States should go to war with Russia over a tiny part of the Ukraine, it's absolute madness.
42. Go and look at the SDA's last "result." A pay cut relative to inflation AND decreased conditions for employees, because it was either that shit deal or a worse result from arbitration.
43. >union shill Ah, found another who hates people that actually work for a living
44. That's not what facism is. That's a dictatorship. Learn the difference. The basic and most easily accessible explanation of facism is the following. 1. The cult of tradition. “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.” **The LNP does this. They are conservative and growing more so.** 2. The rejection of modernism. “The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense, Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.” **The LNP does this. Lots of things that are modern, among them abortion, racial equality, and LGBTQI equality are rejected by the LNP.** 3. The cult of action for action’s sake. “Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.” **The LNP is running on an adult crime, adult time slogan despite all metrics showing a decrease in crime in general and youth crime in particular.** 4. Disagreement is treason. “The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture, the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.” **Arguably not there yet.** 5. Fear of difference. “The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.” **You only need to look at their campaign platform to see this in action.** 6. Appeal to social frustration. “\[…\] one of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups. **Again, see their campaign platform.** 7. The obsession with a plot. “The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.” **Stop the boats, if you don't know vote no, adult crime adult time...** 8. The enemy is both weak and strong. “\[…\] the followers must be convinced that they can overwhelm the enemies. Thus, by a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.” **Labor are simultaneously corrupt authoritarian union lackeys who control everything yet somehow are too incompetent to govern.** 9. Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. “For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.” **Not there yet.** 10. Contempt for the weak. “Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.” **Definitely a feature of the LNP.** 11. Everybody is educated to become a hero. “in Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.” **Not there yet.** 12. Machismo and Weaponry. “This is the origin of machismo (which implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality). Since even sex is a difficult game to play, the Ur-Fascist hero tends to play with weapons—doing so becomes an ersatz phallic exercise.” **LNP policy both literal (they want to wind back gun restriction) and figurative (anti-LGBTQI policies are the norm from them).** 13. Selective Populism. “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People. **Have you seen their campaign? Do you read the Courier Mail or Daily Telegraph or watch Nine news? Have you seen Sky News or listened to talk back radio?** 14. Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.” **See election slogans.** 11/14 features met and they are only accelerating in that direction.
45. Again if it was only about oppressing the individual for the importance of the state then all the fascist leaders of history wouldn't be these godlike figures in their history and would be quashed for the collective group since their higher status goes against that. And even your definition doesn't represent the Greens anyway since they don't have a group they want to push above all others considering they are always talking about bringing the rights of everyone up together, can't quash the rights of the individual when your whole mantra is bringing them up with you.
46. No 6 month old account with a word word number username, I'm pointing out that the reason trump doesn't want war is because he is a different kind of immoral to the type everyone is used to.
47. you really went to chat GPT and asked, "what is fascism" lol.
48. I never said it was the *only* characteristic of fascism. It’s just one of them, the others being Autocracy, and totalitarianism. Both which require a single unchallenged leader. Even if your reasoning was correct, there is nothing to say that a fascist leader would have rules for thee but not for me, meaning that while he wanted the states wellbeing to take precedence for the rest of the country, by nature of his position, he would still enjoy the privilege of individualism.
49. He is just so immoral that he doesn’t want hundreds of thousands of people to die. What a monster
50. You don't know what the difference between a dictatorship and facism is and you don't recognise the most famous work on facism in Umberto Eco's writing. Either you are not a serious person and are arguing in bad faith, or you are outright an LNP shill.
51. Again since when do The Greens have some kind of autocratic leader or police state policy. Your own definition doesn't even match The Greens at all. They don't push for some kind of military force or surveillance of your description, nor do they have some kind of unchallenged figurehead. They push for more foreign aid to other countries, how is that helping the "state collective above all else"
52. He is so immoral he wants putin to take Ukraine and then more of Europe too, yes, he's a monster. He doesn't care about people's lives at all, he would happily go to war to get what he wants, he's stirring up a civil war right now.
53. > You don’t know what the difference between a dictatorship and facism is and you don’t recognise the most famous work on facism in Umberto Eco’s writing. Eco defined Fascism as a symbol that has an infinite number of interpretations. So Eco’s writing on Fascism is useless. You are saying that because the LNP is conservative, and fascism is accounted with right wing politics, that the LNP is in fact, a fascist organisation. But clearly, this is not the case, because virtually all democracy’s have right wing parties and governments yet they are not fascist. Fascism is characterised by authoritarianism, and dictatorship. There is a difference between dictatorship and fascism, because they are 2 seperate descriptions of political phenomena. But they always go hand in hand. Fascism is authoritarianism, fascism is Autocracy. Unless you can prove that the LNP in this state election is seriously attempting to remove democratic due process by forcibly removing opposition, then the LNP is not fascist, and is simply right wing. And no I’m not an LNP shill, I literally voted labour today. But that doesn’t make your argument any less stupid.
54. > Again since when do The Greens have some kind of autocratic leader or police state policy. Your own definition doesn’t even match The Greens at all. I never said the greens had autocratic leader policies, I was responding to someone who said that there are probably some extremists LNP members who would push trump lite agendas, which is referring to the allegations, at least according to some, that trump is a fascist who wants to destroy American democracy by making himself a dictator. I replied with a comment that there are probably greens members who would love the idea of a forever far left government. This isn’t as far fetched as you think, there are lots of insinuations made to the idea of a revolution made by your average green type voters at every single indigenous rights protest. You know what a revolution is right? > They don’t push for some kind of military force or surveillance of your description, nor do they have some kind of unchallenged figurehead. They push for more foreign aid to other countries, how is that helping the “state collective above all else” I wasn’t accusing the hypothetical greens members of fascism, because that wouldn’t make sense. You don’t have to be fascist and right wing to be authoritarian and autocratic. In fact, the extreme left and extreme right share many characteristics with each other.
55. I am saying that the LNP's current platforms lean heavily into facistic territory and do so increasingly year to year. Are the facists yet? Maybe, maybe not. Are they headed that way? Absolutely. And you are still wrong about what facism is. Learn about it first before you try to lecture people on it. Facism is an actual, discrete thing.
56. In some ways the far right and left do have parallels but then again so do centrist/moderates have similarities to the far right and far left. It's doesn't really mean anything
57. Until the LNP start making moves to end democratic process in Australia, they are not fascist, only conservative.
58. But it does mean something. If you love political freedom, then you would detest both an extreme left or right government. Communist China has no problem with rounding up political opponents and sending them to reeducation camps, neither did nazi Germany. Our democratic system, while not perfect is pretty damn good, and people who cannot see that are way to politically inclined to one end of the spectrum.
59. if elected, they're going to introduce an election process which makes it harder for every other party to get in government, thus, concreting their stranglehold of governance. thats straight out of the fascist playbook.
60. Israel has been jailing journalists on mass lately, the USA has the highest population of prisoners on the planet, and Australia locks up whistleblowers for 5 years for acting in the public interest. At least in China you get an extremely fast rail and affordable housing out of its paranoia, our current generation live in tents.
61. tankie is such a old man thing to say, its not 1960 anymore grandpa that was 60 years ago and the soviet union changed management over 30 years ago
62. Anyone voting for LNP needs to fuck off from the state.
