Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. I haven't been anywhere near West End for years and I do yoga without footwear on the grass every morning...
2. Greens policy is to divest from coal while using coal money to fund their absurd policies.
3. I also posted this to the comment above you, but: How would electing a Greens MP make an LNP government happen? The most it could possibly do is reduce Labor from a clear majority to a Labor-Greens minority government (but that's very unlikely). If neither Labor nor the LNP have a majority after the election, the sitting Premier gets to have the first go at forming the next government. There is no situation where electing a Greens MP makes an LNP government happen unless Labor walk away from the prospect of relying on Greens support for confidence and supply.
4. By that do you mean that the Greens shouldn't campaign in Labor seats, despite their policies being popular there? Or should the Greens choose less popular policies instead so that Labor looks better by contrast?
5. Yes I said STOP touching grass. Might want to diversify your nightstand books beyond The Female Eunech
6. I think the greens’ campaign slogans and messaging should perhaps be less aggressively targeted against labor. Otherwise I feel the chances of an LNP government are increased
7. In my view that's much less of a concern due to mandatory voting and preference flows. We have a pretty low risk of people checking out and not voting due to disappointment, and it's a rare Greens voter who would preference the LNP over Labor.
8. >THE AUSTRALIAN: ‘No target’ leader has taken the voters for mugs. >The manner in which Crisafulli conducted himself gives rise to valid concern about how he would govern. The detail-light small target approach might have been tactically adept, but it was an insult to the electorate and a new low in political sophistry. Newspoll: * 2PP = LNP 52.5 ALP 47.5 * PV = LNP 42 ALP 33 GRN 11 ON 8 OTH 6 * Miles' Performance = Approval 45 Disapproval 48 Undecided 7 * Crisafulli's Performance = Approval 43 Disapproval 46 Undecided 11 * Preferred Premier = Miles 45 Crisafulli 42 Undecided 13 [https://i.gyazo.com/54e05e4b53e990654d3fc8d2dd9fe0ca.png](https://i.gyazo.com/54e05e4b53e990654d3fc8d2dd9fe0ca.png) The LNP had a massive lead in every metric over the past ten months, and started the election campaign at, * 2PP = 58% * PV = 48% * Predicted Seats = 65+ Miles has worked relentlessly during this campaign and somehow has surged in popularity to lead in Preferred Premier.
9. I am still fully expecting a LNP government (keeping my expectations down so i don't get disappointed on Saturday night), but i am pretty certain they would be just a one term government again, and would end up getting massacred in 2028 because the LNP can't stop themselves from being the LNP and doing very stupid political moves
10. Latest internal polling says the LNP shouldn't get too excited. If there's any time to make sure your friends, family and loved ones are making an informed decision this Saturday, it's now. We can still prevent an LNP government.
11. Have we forgotten the disastrous performance of the lnp when they where on the helm last time? Why would anyone vote for them
12. Please for the love of god can the ALP win I just want more rail infrastructure development before i fuck off out west once I graduate uni is that so much to ask
13. Why any worker would vote LNP, the party who's only interest is to kowtow to the ultra wealthy, is beyond me. Stop wanting to be owned. Get over your Daddy issues. Develop self-respect. Know your self-worth, and don't simply bend over for the 1% because Murdoch told you to.
14. Who the fuck would vote for these LNP wackos? I mean they seem to be as right wing as the US Republican GOP! Chrisafulli is a dangerous little tool, for the Chritian right. I bet it's those nutjob Pentecostals.
15. Never once have I been polled. Where do they get these stats?
16. ring up all ya family ages 18+ and drive them into polls If its going to be narrow then itll mean alot
17. Can we make it better? Narrow win for Miles please 😊.
18. The ALP have run a better campaign then expected but I still feel it aint enough to scrape back in.
19. It has become clear to me the majority of this subreddit does not understand how polling or statistics works. "1000 people are a small sample size" " Polls are wrong because they only talk to people who pick up the phone" " This poll is wrong because it's from NewsCorp" I would encourage everyone to research how polling works, [Pew research](https://www.pewresearch.org/course/public-opinion-polling-basics/#is-accurate-polling-becoming-harder-to-do) has a great resource I understand the subreddit is quite progressive and inhaling copium, but liberals seem likely to win a majority. Steven has done a great job of closing the gap though.
20. opinion polling I feel like has run its course and doesn't have the near certainty it used to have.
21. So chances are, ALP wins then lol. If they have gone from : "They are going to win" Media speak - It's a close race And now they are at "Its a narrow win" - they are going to lose. Hope that it is the case.
22. plz no i dont want them to win at all we finally got the most competent leader we had in over a decade and we gotta ditch him for a lying control freak wtf
23. I think the ideal scenario for me would actually be if it was a draw and hung parliament, with the balance of power and oversight lying with the crossbench. It just depends on which minor parties would likely be there.
24. This is also Murdoch media who HEAVILY wants LNP in power. Cast your vote for Labor and change the narrative
25. Hope they need one nation to get over the line ,
26. Nah its probably a LNP landslide, they always pretend that its closer so people vote for a massive LNP majority because they are scared of the"chaos" of a minority government. They said NT would be close and look what happened.
27. Does anyone how accurate these polls are? Have they ever been wrong?
28. More and more I’m convinced that political polls mean absolutely nothing and could be entirely on the money, close to the money, or so far away from reality that it begs belief. I guess we’ll find out tomorrow how steeped in reality every one is.
29. Latest poll also said 9 out of 10 polls are made up!
30. News poll doesn’t much skin in the game. The betting agencies do. The result is still almost a certain LNP win.
31. Whoever wins is going to have some massive problems on their hands. The Olympics is a complete disaster, and the homeless situation has been a monumental stuff up that will take years to rectify. And if Labor wins, they're going to have to fulfil their big spending election promises, including providing school lunches to every primary school aged state school student in Queensland by February 2025. Zero chance of that happening.
32. Wait, why the fuck is LNP PV so high? Who the hell did they do deals with?
33. Honestly if Miles loses and the Qld ALP left faction still has enough seats to put Fentiman (who would still be a good opposition leader), I hope he gets parachuted into federal politics next year
34. I should be a dyed in the wool LNP voter. I am supposedly their core demographic. I grew up voting for the Liberals. But I am genuinely scared of the economic damage the LNP plans will reap on QLD. Scrapping Pioneer-Burdekin would be a huge loss to the energy security of the state. Borumba is going to be 2030 assuming no delays and Pioneer would be mid 2030s to 2040 on current schedule. By that stage, Gladstone, Callide B, Tarong, and Tarong North power stations will have all hit their EOL. Borumba will add 2GW of power generation to the grid, but those coal plants that are EOL account for 4.2GW so we will need to find a minimum of 2.2GW. Pioneer is meant to be 5GW.
35. I’m so scared about a conservative right wing government. First thing they’ll do is slash jobs and remove reproductive rights. They’ve already indicated how they’ll govern
36. Most Murdoch polls are crocks. … Oh, you meant the cold-blooded reptile.
37. Honest question, why do we need to prevent an LNP government????
38. > Why would anyone vote for them Short memories, maliciousness, stupidity, selfishness.
39. You probably won’t get to use those trains unless you’re studying for another 1-5 decades
40. Incorrect, federal Labor is definitely a government for the rich. Most working class vote Liberals.
41. Unfortunately I'd wager that there's a ton of voters out there that will vote LNP for no reason other than "it's time for a change". Right wing propaganda works dangerously well on people that don't follow what's going on closely
42. And people who believe they'll solve youth crime and couldn't give a shit about any other policy or issue
43. Huge because millions still havnt voted, taken a poll or even watched the news. These numbers are highly inaccurate
44. Voting is mandatory, we’re not in the US where you have to encourage people to show up to vote.
45. And it's sad cos comparatively it's LNPs 'what campaign' Again 🤦 and it got them in last time 🤦
46. He’s not a pundit and doesn’t really comment much on polls
47. You'd be putting sonething like KAP or One Nation in a dangerous position of power, that they absolutely do not deserve.
48. To be honest not really. I am suffering a ton of physical pain today and am in a bad way. It doesn't matter who gets in today because the damage that the federal LNP did to me can not be undone.
49. Betting agencies just respond to the betting market and nothing more.
50. Newspoll is the most accurate polling company in Australia. Reddit is going to be in for a shock
51. PV is preference vote or first preference vote, so it’s more the opposite: LNP voters vote for the LNP, and very few preference towards them (usually).
52. Miles will stay ALP leader, Crisafulli, at best, will be a one term premier. I’d also question whether Crisafulli will remain as LNP leader once KAPs private members bill comes up.
53. Comments that are clearly meant as hate speech will be removed immediately and users banned. https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy
54. I work in IT, my wife in Banking, we're Christians... Both quite conservative people. But we've never even entertained the LNP. It seems they're only trying to make themselves rich and look out for the likes of Gina & Clive, and stuff everyone else. They've run on the fiction of youth crime (my wife volunteer's at a youth detention centre), and the fact of the matter is, it's basically a lie. Then when confronted with an actual partial fix in school lunches, they just try to shit on it.
55. Its quite stupid to scrap them especially given the context surrounding coal plants running up on EOL. I hope that they come to there senses and go through it fully otherwise there will be major issues but I don't think they plan that far ahead.
56. Agree . . the missed opportunity on hydro storage will bite us all in the ass.
57. The LNP aren't the Liberals. They are basically the nationals that rebranded after the name became a bit too dirty in Queensland after Joh.
58. > Oh, you meant the cold-blooded reptile. Could still be talking about Murdoch...
59. Sorry this is wrong. Newspoll has been the most accurate poll for 6 of the last 7 elections
60. It's polling that parties do themselves. Other polling is from independent sources like news and think tanks
61. Their plans to scrap mining royalties, and a few hydro-electric dams should be enough (seriously why the fuck are they making energy diversity and water security partisan positions). But otherwise - their plan to make youth crime worse, and gut state assets and the public sector.
62. To put it simply, The LNPs plans are to put Queensland back twenty years in terms of progress again similar to what they did in 2012-2015 where they gutted the Health department and more, Especially when you consider they are likely to also vote in favour of removing basic health rights like Abortion from being accessed.
63. >Honest question Because the LNP are christian nationalists that want to impose medieval restrictions on woman's health. They believe an omnipotent alien creature that looks like an old European bloke with long white hair and a beard will allow them to come and live with him when they die if they are cruel to woman. Heaven is a place where you get to spend eternity basking in that old man smell. And, anyone that believes that superstitious nonsense should never be in any position of power.
64. Don't you remember how much of a fuck up the last LNP government was between can do cambell terminating front line health care staff and scom fucking off during the bushfires have the LNP actually done anything good for the people
65. But other people will. And it will benefit everyone. Sunshine Coast is in desperate need of decent public transport
66. If by working class you mean people who don't know anything except what Murdoch tells them on his media monopoly, then ok. You are pretty much ass backwards on that though - LNP exist only to enrich the top 0.1%
67. That's why Matt Canavan met Gina Rheinhardts private jet recently and handed her flowers. That sort of working class?
68. I was watching 4 Corners tonight about black voters who vote for Trump. What an eye opener as to how stupid people can be when voting, and their irrational thinking when doing so.
69. Yep. My parents are usually incredibly well-informed when it comes to politics, but I think they’ve been so focussed on the craziness of the US election that they may have actually fallen from the Newscorp/ LMP schtick. Today I might mention their links to the GOP, because when I was talking to my dad, he’s been saying ‘the LNP are matching every Labor policy, and youth crime is bad, and the preventative measures from the camps should work’.
70. Sadly, there will be people who are voting that don’t remember Campbell Newman and what he did with the very team who are running for government now. Additionally, a lot of those people who are considering voting lnp for the ‘ change’ are in opportunities provided for them by labour that the LNP previously slashed .
71. And to send Albanese a clear message: don’t govern this country try just for real estate buyers agents only!
72. Having worked the polls, it's only really reflective of the people who: (1) Pick up a call from a random phone number—especially in the arvo/evening; (2) Do not hang up immediately; (3) Do not hang up when they're asked what age group they fall into; (4) Are older than 40—see all the above; (5) Usually have strong opinions about that election campaign or politics in general. For the information at the end, data is plagued with response bias: e.g., extreme answers, idk answers—*both of these is often related to not caring, or wanting to finish a survey after having a whinge*—and non-response (i.e., those who do not answer tended to vote differently). Accuracy has arguably gotten worse since the death of the landline.
73. I agree the LNP have been going very small target apart from their own stuff ups (i.e. abortion), I've got plenty of criticisms of the ALP too but I really want to be wrong about my initial comment while watching the count on Saturday night.
74. No, they don't deserve it. But in a unicameral system I believe that a strong third and fourth party is the only way that the government could realistically be kept in check. Naturally I think we are moving toward four major parties anyway, due to how divided society is, whether LNP and Labor like it or not. Australians are just notoriously loyal to a brand, so it will take time.
75. Or when Sportsbet paid out an early one million labor victory in 2019... that Labor lost.
76. Well if the corporate LNP-sympathising newspapers say that the LNP is going to win .. who are we to disagree? I for one welcome our LNP propagandist overlords.
77. is part of the reason why they want to get rid of mandatory preferential voting, and just go to optional (where you only have to number one box instead of all of them) because the flow of preferences favours other parties
78. I can see him getting axed over the KAP bill once it gets through as a sort of 'look, the bad guy is gone, we're different now, promise' while continuing to fuck the state exactly the same as they always were.
79. I think he did say that he would resign rather than break his word. 😂😂😂😂😂sorry, I can’t see that happening.
80. Tell the people of Townsville that youth crime is a fiction.
81. >don't think they plan that far ahead. They do bit they are just hoping they can continue posturing for their base while waiting for a Labor government to actually do the work.
82. They did the same thing in SA. Labor planned a $600m state owned power plant (was gas and renewable iirc), and the libs wanted to revamp a closed uni building for another aboriginal art museum. Libs won 🤦 but yea I agree that alone should be enough for people to not be dickheads and vote for these clowns. And they are just 2 blimps out of thousands... but fucking gullible sheeple
83. Personally Mining Royalties need to be put back into public health and infrastructure development. Apart from that the less bureaucrats we have in any government. The better it will be.
84. Reproductive Rights are a subject that requires a lot of nuance to understand. What I care about are Nuclear Power Generation, a carbon copy of the US Second Amendment at the top of the state constitution (and tell Canberra to go and get fucked), and vapes being freely available (any shop I go to won't sell to under 18). I also believe in small, limited governance. Which is completely antithetical to what the ALP/Greens represent.
85. Did you see who flew with Albanese on that “skills” summit 2 years ago?
86. That's where you turn around and say 'what policies..? What budget..?'. And his source for the youth crime? One that's not a part of the LNP bullshit dribble that's absolutely everywhere...
87. Well your parents need to become well informed again before voting because the LNP are about to set Qld back a long way.
88. KAP or PHON aren't strong third and fourth parties. If ALP get a minority government, they'll just deal with the greens in the crossbench and ignore the nutters. If LNP get in, it'll be the opposite and you really don't want to give the balance of power to PHON or KAP.
89. Thanks the thing is I didn't have to do this and I probably shouldn't have because it's been regressive to me personally. I could and probably should have been be trying to advance myself in other ways but physical pain though not an excuse does alter your mindset. Still it's personal cop out and I should have been trying to make the best with what I have instead of carrying this eternal grudge. As the saying goes "Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves".. Of course there are many other reasons that have already been thrashed out here and I'm glad we were given the opportunity to discus them. I don't know about everyone else but I cant wait to give the internet away for a good few months , be present to the world to focus on the simple things and reconnect with my community. Thanks again and good luck to you
90. > Well if the corporate LNP-sympathising newspapers say that the LNP is going to win No, we're able to predict a slim LNP majority from the polling data collected by Pyxis Polling & Insights.
91. Yeah I was trying to explain this to my partner. It's so stupid why would I even want to put a number in a party I'd never in a million years agree with. It feels dirty even knowing they used your vote.
92. Props for the use of persona pic in the wild
93. Statically, Youth Crime, even in the Regions, are lower then they've been in years, if not decades. Yes they're are more extreme, although the way they're reported has changed significantly too.
94. What exactly do you think locking up disadvantaged kids is going to do other than create a delayed crime wave for LNP to blame on labour in 8 years? Why not vote for the party trying to fix the root causes instead of the ones slapping a bandaid on a laceration?
95. Please google confirmation bias. Voting should be considered on the greater good, not me,me,me. The best thing we can do is to vote for a party that will cut programs and resources for kids in abusive, addicted and neglectful households. /s
96. Mining royalties are being spent on cost of living and infrastructure initiatives, so that's already being done. And keep in mind the public sector isn't just beureaucrats. It's police officers, fire fighters, paramedics, doctors, nurses, main roads, public transport operators, and so much more than just people sitting behind a desk (though that's not to say they aren't important too). All of which were heavily impacted the last time LNP got into gov, and will almost certainly be back in the firing line this time. I wouldn't put it past them to try and privatise the service provided by Queensland ambulance for instance.
97. People always complain about "bureaucrats" until the public service gets slashed, and then suddenly everyone is whingeing because it turns out that you can't actually run public servives without public servants. When public service cuts hit, you can rest assured that the high-level bureaucrats will keep their fat paychecks. But they'll be more than happy to get rid of the ordinary people on the ground doing actual work to keep the state running.
98. I'd prefer public servants paid 80k a year, over outsourcing those jobs to private firms which cost much more and have less oversight.
99. What the fuck, how old are you? You prioritise policy like an edgy teenage boy from America
100. > Reproductive Rights are a subject that requires a lot of nuance to understand. Not really. Women and girls deserve reproductive rights and access to healthcare. What’s so difficult to understand about that?
101. Sounds like you should be living somewhere that meets those needs, like the US. You'll never get a US style 2nd amendment here. It is simply not a part of our culture like it has been in the US for over 200 years.
102. You want vapes to be sold to u18s? Limited governance is exactly why Australia is a shitshow now. Have you been overseas and seen what first world countries like Singapore do to get that rich. They made sure rule of law is in place and the people get the basics like housing at an affordable price. That takes a lot of government over reach to make sure a country remains affordable for the masses. Neoliberal policies don't make a country better. I wish you westerners wake up to this.
103. Then move to America as No one else wants that.
104. 'i believe in small, limited governance' What u reeeeallllly think u gonna get that under an LNP government? Whos only sole interest is to control control and control. And of course, profit of the backs of the common people. Most laughable shit on this thread
