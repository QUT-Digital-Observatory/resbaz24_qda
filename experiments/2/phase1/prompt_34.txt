Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. > .... This is dangerous territory, expanding the role of government significantly out of the bounds of where it should be. The policy intent is a good one but the actual outcomes of these types of policies is the opposite. This announcement made voting LNP a no-brainer for me. Well just look at the super profit businesses that drive inflation up and cost of living up eg, banks. When the financial crisis threatened to I'll them, the government guaranteed them and they went on a spending spree to buy other debt as a gamble to make more profit when the crisis was forgotten, because everyone has short memory for that stuff. The government stepped in, but they should have bought in and then they would have that power to hold mortgages and lower interest rates. What did that Government guarantee get us? Nothing... here we are with banks complaining that they are waiting for the Reserve Bank to lower the cash rate, while they are secretly enjoying the profits from the percentages they retain above and beyond what they need to be some of the most profitable business in the world. What is wrong with a government owned business that builds houses and offers mortgages? It could still make profits to be used for general works, keep personal income tax a bit lower
2. Correct me if I am wrong, but wasn't stamp duty already removed by QLD Labor for first home buyers? Or at least increased the limit at which it would not apply? LNP policy as you have written it sounds like less of an improvement, or at least superfluous. Again, I could be misunderstanding so please don't take this as an attack ha.
3. Either and if they did and I found out I would wipe them.ü§£üòÇ
4. Does he have his own business where he has to pay people minimum wages and provide them with safe working conditions?
5. you'll fit right in with the LNP if you live your life according to spite
6. I wonder how many people vote purely out of spite.
7. A quick tl;dr is that we had a party in power that was v similar to Corbyn era Labour, ala actually implementing policies and programs that helped people. They copped the blame for issues that are happening globally at the moment as the root cause is neo liberal bullshit, not something they personally implemented. As a result we effectively voted in someone that would make Farage and Johnson recoil and hit them with the "that's a bit much, isn't it?", they were voted in by basically all the same nonsense reasonings and justifications for Brexit and will likely be just as damaging as it was.
8. Yeah, sometimes when I think life is getting a bit too stagnant I like to hobble myself, keeps things fresh and introduces a whole new element of danger and excitement to my life!
9. I hope LNP gets more houses built. Just don't see it happening- their voter base benefits from scarcity of housing.
10. It's a shame unions get blamed for housing shortages when it's nothing of the sort. Big commercial builds, yes, but It's more about big developers and unions fighting over who keeps what share of the profit.
11. Neither the LNP nor Labor will touch housing so long as homeowners are such a powerful voting block.
12. This is literally a chance for it to not be an echo chamber. Where are all the LNP supporters from the threads over the last couple weeks? It's a chance to answer the question.
13. Yeah no shit, they are asking why they think the one is best for the state though.
14. I'm a die-hard lefty, and I can't believe you got downvoted for this very reasonable take, lmao.
15. I'm in Clayfield too, voted exactly the same as you for same reasons.
16. >despite both major parties committing to not making any policy changes in that space early on Ah cool so it's all fine as long as they don't make changes to women's healthcare today, just wait a bit? Ladies we've all got 9 months to have a safe pregnancy with full medical care. No need to worry, the guy who said abortion is the biggest human rights crime has definitely changed his mind, as has the party who voted to keep it a criminal offence 6 years ago. Robbie Katter isn't going to bring a vote on abortion as soon as possible. He just launched a scare campaign for no reason with no intent to follow it through. It must be nice to only have to worry about yourself.
17. Except the ‚Äúfresh‚Äù ideas LNP are bring to the table are actually all recycled from the 1950‚Äôs
18. What fresh ideas? Because all I see is simplistic disproven ‚Äú ideas‚Äù. ‚Äú Ideas‚Äù that police and health care professionals have stated don‚Äôt work.Seems like a cynical attempt to appeal to the out dated perspectives of certain conservative voters,in order to get voted in. Winding back policies that work because they don‚Äôt align with your world view, demonstrates a prioritisation of ideology over people.
19. But youth crime is actually trending down‚Ä¶ Funny how LNP have misrepresented the issue and you all believe it‚Ä¶
20. I never understand this economy sentiment. Qld Labor's economic management has been literally world class. Are people blaming global economic issues on the party running a state government?
21. 4. Also UNIONS. The labor party policy being influenced by big unions, driving up costs, etc is rubbish
22. Yes, the election was stolen..... I assume that is what we would have been hearing if it had gone the other way.
23. That last sentence is not true. We were in a deficit with the last LNP government, now we have a 5 billion surplus. The dates and energy rebates didn't cost us, it cost big mining companies.
24. I don't get the downvotes unless it is for the phrasing being unclear. But a few pretty horrific deaths from young repeat offenders offers a little recency bias. But unless both parties are saying to do something about it, that can be weighed on your mind pretty heavily. I argue that theirethod of stopping it won't work, but I appreciate the intent.
25. Did the Miles government also cause property prices and cost of living to skyrocket in NSW, VIC, SA, TAS, NZ, UK, USA, etc?
26. We had this in our electorate. I kid you not, the LNP‚Äôs candidate was the admin of our local Facebook Community Page. No other experience. She didn‚Äôt get elected‚Ä¶
27. That is pretty normal. A guy I went to uni with was one of the "young" whatevers (I cannot remember if it was Labor or Liberals) back in the day. They put him in a seat that was on the NT/QLD border. (I am guessing it was Mt Isa). He lived in Brisbane and had never even been to the place. No active campaigning. Nothing. The only thing that ever came from it was ABC radio caught wind of it and gave him a call, and he said his one policy was he would move to the region if he won. He was banned by <whatever party> for doing anymore press.
28. They are liberal, but not in the way people think liberalism is. They support deregulation and freedom of business and the economy through lower taxes, privatisation of public assets, cutting red tape, cutting public spending etc‚Ä¶. But because this platform isn‚Äôt enough to get elected on its own, they have a cosy relationship with the national (country) party, which brings with it some nasty conservative religious values. But yes they are not the pro-gay, pro-abortion and pro-rights ‚Äúliberals‚Äù of America.
29. I get the whole tribalism thing but how do people associate with words and not at least understand the team they're part of. Better yet, why are people superficial enough to fall for voting for just words and not the ideas behind the parties? Like do they think that voting Labor means they have to do more work? Are they not voting greens because they're skin isn't green? Democracy is great and all, but we need a better system that doesn't turn to fascism where people aren't voting with zero information or critical thinking in their brain. We're in the information age but somehow that information is repetitive familiarisation advertising and smear campaigns rather than explicit policy explanations and decisions. The closest we've had in the last year was the HAFF discussion and the only reason that got any news coverage was because they could use it as a wedge.
30. The only thing the LNP are liberal with is the truth.
31. They have a liberal wing and a conservative wing, if you look hard enough you can see the divide especially between say Birmingham and Dutton or Turnball and Abbott.
32. they are liberal. unfortunately american brain rot and social media has spread the uniqely north american definition of liberal here. liberal means centre-right in most of Europe and Asia too
33. The first time I voted I got mixed up with ALP and LNP üôÉ every year I second guess myself, I wish labour would just show as labour on the ballot paper, no acronyms please
34. There could be some truth to that. Labor seems to be rather authoritarian these days. Federal Labor mainly. There‚Äôs no room for alternative viewpoints in the Labor camp.
35. It was Labor who gave Adani the longest royalty free period in mining history in QLD
36. I should add nuance. Mining company does not inherently = bad. But the Australian Coal Association and other mining lobby groups can get f*cked.
37. Ive been defending QLD as being a state full of dumbasses for so long. Now I think I've been in the wrong the whole time.
38. It‚Äôs important to remember for most people ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù begins and ends at voting. Most people don‚Äôt have a fully fleshed out political view and they think whoever is in charge right now is why things are bad. My father in law only cared about the energy rebates but he still wanted an LNP win. He‚Äôs a smart man but apparently he‚Äôs will to take the hit if it hurts the people he doesn‚Äôt like. They‚Äôd rather vote against someone than for themselves.
39. What's "shocking" about youth crime? I agree the other ones are pretty shocking
40. Unfortunately that's one of the issues is we have to fight a media billionaire and attrition fighting is their speciality. OP's 'voted for the cutest one' is exactly the people that need education away from political apathy. I don't want to stereotype but I guarantee if someone gave a single shit to tell that person about the LNPs policies on abortion rights, they might actually care. Even voting on a single well informed issue is better than 'who's the cutest'.
41. They didn't base it on Mile/Crisafulli, they based it of the electorate candidate
42. I always preference Labor over LNP but how much a candidate can bench is as shit a reason to vote for them as voting based on looks.
43. My mum (now 75) and stepfather never gave away their votes. I remember asking my mum once, and she said it was ‚Äúprivate‚Äù, and ‚Äúa question you should not ask people‚Äù. As a mum now (of teenagers), I encourage conversations about politics, and the connections (many of which are invisible) between political values and people‚Äôs individual and social experiences ‚Ä¶and between the forces (many of which are subversive) between political campaigns and individualistic capitalism. I want to support them to be good humans with a conscience and a heart‚Ä¶who care for each other and the world around them. (Needless to say, I did not vote LNP, so I‚Äôm also curious about the *actual* responses to this thread‚Äôs original question).
44. Maybe that's why i try always vote independent. that's how my family voted for growing up.
45. The LNP are the political wing of the Murdoch empire in this country. Simple as that.
46. There is no argument against compulsory voting, and if there were it would favour the conservatives. When I was 18 my liberal boss used to tell me ‚Äò people like you shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to vote, it‚Äôs a waste‚Äô
47. Unfortunately the flipside to compulsory voting is just the people with political motivations voting, i.e. billionaires for less tax, landlords for less rent control, mining companies for less environmental scrutiny. So it polarises even faster. The real solution is education which is why these parties cut it at all costs. Christofggeeryfdergpli wants to put kids in jail instead...
48. I used to be against compulsory voting but watching the US and UK I‚Äôve done a complete 180. A lot of people don‚Äôt know who they‚Äôre voting for, but having worked a polling booth one year it was pretty clear they know who they‚Äôre not voting for. It‚Äôs not perfect and the alternative they choose often doesn‚Äôt align with their interests and values. But it makes it hard for any party to become extremists and hold seats. It also drags everyone back from culture wars that get people upset enough to vote and re-focuses on the day to day for the average person.
49. I told my mum ALP wanted to fund hospitals more and give kids free school lunch, and that LNP/KAP/ON wanted to fund prisons and allow kids to be put in them. I don‚Äôt actually know how accurate those claims are. I just decided that if she‚Äôs not going to educate herself, my uninformed lefty bullshit can‚Äôt be any worse than Sky/NewsCorp‚Äôs right-wing bullshit.
50. 100%. Not many elections come up where I care who wins or whatever, there has been elections where I simply voted the way I did the previous time but for no particular reason. When I was 18 I was told who to vote for, what 18 year old gives a stuff about politics? So I would say more than half the state or federal elections Ive voted Ive done so so I didn't have to pay a small fine and there would be soooooo many people like me.
51. No the worst part is that it‚Äôs not random at all- the are genuinely simple enough to be swayed by incredibly stupid and easily disproven lies/claims. So they very deliberately vote for charlatans.
52. It has gone really high in the last few years though.
53. Or, they should instead address the issues that lead to people being homeless, not "clear them out" because y'know, they're literal human beings?
54. I know a lot of people with disabilities, including brain inquiries, who are pretty goddamn unhappy with the election results. Don't lump them in with the dipshits who voted LNP. Being a cunt isn't a disability.
55. Come on man these jokes aren‚Äôt cool, people with these disabilities can make informed decisions as well.
56. You seem very nice. I disagree with their reasoning and choices, but you do realise they are my family right?
57. If I hadn't heard the same basic things from my coworkers, I'd be in as much disbelief as you.
58. I'm thankful we don't have a HR dept ( they can be problematic) where I work cause the business is fairly small, but then other times there is so much bs that goes on, there are times where it may actually be needed
59. If employees would do their jobs properly they wouldn‚Äôt get screwed over
60. Yeah it‚Äôs a pity no one could seperate the Victorian branch from the QLD branch (nothing to do with Victoria) but that‚Äôs the Murdoch media for you. Even Mr Potato Head mentioned the union while he was standing next to old mate Crisafooli. Anyway let‚Äôs see how big his magic wand is, he‚Äôs already back tracked on resigning if he can‚Äôt fix crime. I predict‚Ä¶..they‚Äôll outspend Labor, they won‚Äôt get much of what they said done, they‚Äôll send us backwards in regards to the environment to suit their mining mates and they‚Äôll take a lot of financial packages that Labor has given us to help with their budget that will also go into deficit all while blaming Labor for the next three years.
61. So there is only one industry in Queensland and it's controlled by the CFMEU? Wow, you must have a small network.
62. permanency wasn't a protection against Newman, I know people who still have stress from days of people just being called into an office to get walked out under Newman's cuts.
63. She hates the unions but isn‚Äôt averse to keep receiving all the benefits they got her. Wouldn‚Äôt it be awesome if people who didn‚Äôt like working with unions just get a flat wage and see how far that gets them
64. That‚Äôs what the white collar workers don‚Äôt realise, the unions blue collar rights that have been won through campaign has always trickled over to white collar workers. Do you like your holiday pay? Sick pay? Maternity/paternity leave? Stress leave? 40hr working week? Overtime? Etc etc All union fought for.
65. > union behaviour can piss people off Why, because they argue for better conditions and rights for workers? > especially if your job is to negotiate with them Only if you're a manager who wants to exploit the fuck out of their workers.
66. But we‚Äôre the second last developed nation on the planet to stabilise inflation and have them go back down.
67. You're one post away from beginning to rant about the great replacement, huh?
68. Okay? My family doesn‚Äôt use reddit so I don‚Äôt see how anything you said is relevant to what I said?
69. Agreed. I‚Äôm a staunch Labor supporter, but the stadium flip-flopping was one of the few things I was genuinely disappointed about.
70. Yeah man see the lions avi in your profile pic‚Ä¶ really was a toxic walk back for Steven miles telling AFL fans no new home at Gabba but Suncorp stadium was getting a upgrade (our most recently built stadium)
71. I‚Äôm no fan of Crisafulli though because he sidestepped the topic and pushed it out another 100 days‚Ä¶ all I know is QSAC was going to be pretty embarrassing being on the world stage
72. I actually thought that. New stadium backflip by both parties - just too toxic of a policy to announce when you campaigning on the back of a cost of living crisis
73. The real problem was the messaging, that‚Äôs where they completely fucked it. a) championing the independent review for months only to then turn around and completely ignore the recommendation the day it dropped was *mind-bogglingly* stupid; especially when the option they went with was one that not only did nobody like; but that the independent review itself specifically called out as being an all-round terrible idea. b) Not once did I see mentioned anywhere that the stadium would effectively be paid for entirely by the IOC/Olympics revenue. It‚Äôs literally in the contract that is publicly available, that as part of the hosting rights you get all of the ticketing revenue, merchandising revenue and a large chunk of broadcast money that totals to >$2.5bn AUD. The media didn‚Äôt mention it, the government didn‚Äôt mention it, nobody. I only found out about it on a fucking football forum full of angry lions fans. How do you fuck that up? One of the biggest public issues with the stadium was the perceived cost to the taxpayer, and they could‚Äôve avoided all that by saying the taxpayer wouldn‚Äôt actually be footing the bill - and it would be a win win because we needed a new stadium anyway so we essentially get one for free.
74. I believe this. I mean, I think we sometimes forget how decentralised QLD is compared to other states. The extremely watered down plans for the Olympics was to not upset the regions (especially north QLD, we all know how many north Queenslanders despise the SE corner). Even though the ALP lost, I still think it was the right move politically.
75. Yeah another flip flop woulda been horrible. But they absolutely snookered themselves
76. So, you‚Äôd rather vote for the LNP and see assets privatised, services gutted, and workers sacked, all because you didn‚Äôt like their stadium proposal? Good job.
77. Do you honestly think the premier is the sole hand responsible for things like choosing a stadium location? Damn dude. At least under ALP you would have gotten free lunches in primary school. You know, helps young minds learn.
78. How can you be that shortsighted? Unbelievably stupid decision to waste your entire vote based on the Olympics plans üôÉ
79. None of whom are entitled to a job. Go into the private sector.
80. Oh gosh, I really hope they don't do it again. Surely not? :(
81. 14000 workers total. Which is still not great but let‚Äôs stick to facts.
82. 'Public service contractors' just sounds so much more palatable than 'doctors, nurses and teachers who are on contracts' doesn't it?
83. Our departments IT Capability is like 90% contractors. It's that way because we are about to recieve a whole bunch of people from elsewhere in government and we need to set a cultural expectation. On one hand, contractors are billed at 3x salary by the contracting agencies. It's good to save money. On the other, the incoming crew have such a strong apathy as a collective that it's absolutely the main reason we have issues. Sacking the contractors might be financial but it will doom us to the stone ages.
84. Literal lol if you think LNP will be offering better pay
85. What, happy and get shit done vibe? Yea real bad taste...
86. What he did for the state in the few months he was in...he can have his little jet ski ride. Dunno about you but my ego certainly isnt affected.
87. Election bids are funded by the parties not the state?
88. Where? And does it show the names? Or does it just show the creeps living in your area?
89. Half price is no where near 50c. If you are calculating your shopping budget down to the loaf of bread, $5 or even $2 the difference between eating or not eating for a day.
90. Noone under 16 can receive medical treatment without the consent of a parent/gaurdian. To get a child prescribed hormone therapy takes a lot more than just rocking up at a clinic and asking for it. Kids are prescribed hormone therapy for a multitude of medical conditions and no one bats an eye. The second it‚Äôs to stop them from k*lling themselves it‚Äôs a problem? The pill is prescribed to girls under 16 to help with the symptoms of pcos, endometriosis, or acne. That‚Äôs literally oestrogen hormone therapy. When a child has cancer, a growth deficiency, or delayed puberty they will be given anabolic steroids. Steroids are man made testosterone. Puberty blockers wear off if you stop taking them. It‚Äôs not surgery. It gives the person time to figure out their gender, and any other problems they may have and desperately reduces the risk of s*icide. If they hit 18 or older and decide they actually are their assigned gender they can taper off.
91. Good thing what you think doesn't matter, and what peer reviewed studies have concluded does
92. > We do have a gender clinic at the Queensland Childrens Hospital that will happily prescribe puberty blockers to children. Good, children cis or trans require this medication in order to treat a wide range of issues. > I, for one, don't think that is a good thing. Your opinion means nothing compared to actual peer reviewed studies and the medical community.
93. Why though? Puberty blockers simply prolong the start of puberty. Once a child is old enough (18) to decide for themselves if they are trans and would like to continue HRT, then they stop the use of puberty blockers and start taking hormones. They need parental consent to go on HRT before the age of 18 and will be under the guidance of a doctor. If instead they realise they are not trans, they simply stop taking puberty blockers and they go through their body‚Äôs natural puberty.
94. Tbf neither major party seems interested in public education. All their kids go to private schools.
95. It's not in their interest for their constituents to have brains of their own.
96. Honestly, it was Labor that brought in Equity and Excellence and downward pressure on school principals not to suspend or exclude horrifically violent children. It‚Äôs a Labor government that appointed a terrible, terrible Director General that destroyed any trust teachers had in their employer caring about them. It‚Äôs also a Labor government appointment that seeks to remove Civics and Citizenship from high schools to replace it with VET. It‚Äôs a Labor government policy to turn schools into diploma factories. It‚Äôs a Labor appointment that told teachers that they weren‚Äôt allowed to only work their paid hours of employment. It‚Äôs a Labor government that took the QTU to the QIRC for telling teachers to only work according to the award conditions under which they were employed.
97. Especially the bush councils who believe EVERYTHING they‚Äôre fed by NewsCorp and SkyNews. I went to their convention once for work and could not believe to frankly hilariously maga-level rubbish they were all circle-jerking over.
98. I'm not sure if their candidates in the relevant electorates promised those things during the campaign but given the amount of affection the Liberals, both state and federal, have always shown for education, the disabled, poor people, public transport and public infrastructure I think even the most optimistic LNP voter wouldn't be taking these as guarantees.
99. Spoiler alert: the dog voted for the Legalise Cannabis party.
100. Correct, this is the 102nd year with no State Senate
