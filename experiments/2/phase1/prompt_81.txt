Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. David “boy in the lib bubble” crisafulli. Like honestly I hate getting involved in politics. But this cunt really wants to take us back into the dark ages. Then refuses to answer any questions. Libs I’m available for PR training hit me up. This is now diabolical. Not a fan of you guys, but if the moneys there I don’t care
2. Meh, its state government the redheaded step brother of politics Healthcare even despite having to scramble through a pandemic isnt sexy enough to deserve extra funding, and if it does you need to ask big federal brother for the cash Ditto any big infrastructure spending like roads, transport or social housing Sure there are social policy like drugs or abortion but once again these arent really going to change too much, even if labor really tried the scare campaign after the katters got one sound bite at the beginning of the election In the end there will be some jobs in public service cut, as is the liberal way, union corruption will be replaced by big business corruption and in 3 months time the public jobs will be offset by olympic stadium jobs for a net zero return The police blowing their budget on the eve of the election by $100m means they wont have enough boots on the ground to enforce these laws any wayy The next four years 47% will complain about 53% of the population in the hope that 2% change ther mind. Just hopefully not to one nation or some other party just in it for the free election lunch
3. I was looking for this [policy comparison](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-23/queensland-election-promises-steven-miles-david-crisafulli/104456928) to help me decide.
4. I’d just love to see them (Giggles and Chrisafullashit) go toe to toe. I’m only 75kg and feel I could wipe the floor with Dave-0. What would Milesy do to him.
5. I'm in the same boat as you. Brisbane has become my home of choice and I can do is stand on the sidelines and watch. It's so sad and frustrating
6. To be honest, and I know this is bad, but I don't even know who is going to do what and when. Every time they're on tv, or I find campaign mail, it's literally just one set of people complaining about another set. They almost never mention what they're actually planning to do, just complian about whatever their competition is currently up to. It's embarrassing to watch.
7. Elections are a great dilemma, often is like choosing between cancer or aids
8. The labour is so corrupt, the LNP will sell your future to rich mates, the greens are ratbags, who you going to vote for?
9. LNP’s master of pan? It’s been his plan all along to build nuclear power stations that could deform unborn babies, which they’d then make illegal to abort, so there will be a whole cohort of people born so retarded that they voted for LNP in the future.
10. Eh I'd rather a slime ball that does something about youth crime at this stage
11. Im sick of voting and hearing constantly about elections in the media. I honestly dont know much about either candidate i pay zero attention to the local news, and no attachment to anything in the community. But still I must go cast a donkey vote to avoid the $160 fine. Theres extensive corruption and I would like to have the right to abstain from voting altogether.
12. Steven miles...I've not followed this incredibly closely but what I have seen is man who's absolutely appalling under pressure and doesn't know his arse from his tit. How anyone can vote for him absolutely baffles me. Enjoy your election guys
13. I voted for no one yesterday. Got my name ticked off the role.
14. I don't know why you ever thought the LNP was anything else. This has always been their MO. It's baffling they get any votes. That said, the ALP candidate is pretty terrible, but at least the party itself is significantly better.
15. LNP Costings don't make sense though. How can they expect to have a surplus budget whilst removing rhe coal royalties that are pretty much propping up our economy in QLD?
16. It’s a disgrace that any party is allowed on the ballot without costings released. Barely over 24 hours for people to actually look at the plans is a farce.
17. Seriously. The fact that they're allowed to wait this long before revealing costings is disgusting. Voters have the right to know before early voting takes place.
18. We are in the middle of this shit in NZ, don't vote for anyone that even remotely looks like they will do this, it is devastating our capital city (wellington) . That's money from social housing, hospitals, cor public service. And it goes on. The flow on effect to other organisation's is catastrophic, we have the highest number of NZ based businesses going broke than we've ever had, all our taxpayers are moving to Aus! They've even changed the way we do school lunches, they were all being made by local people using local suppliers, now it's some fcking big conglomerate in the bloody UK providing them! They have the worst school lunches in the world. The govt is tying us into multiple decades with these contracts. They are gunning for our precious health system :(
19. >complains goverment can't do anything >proposes cutting away the one resource the doing part of the government actually wants Peak leadership right there people
20. That money is from current fees paid to the Big Four consultancies, not current public sector spending, fyi
21. As someone who works for a QLD GOC, I can tell you that it is insanely bloated. The amount of deadwood and excessive red tape is mind boggling. For example for us, any spend over $10m needs to go to 3 committees, two panels, two other external govt bodies, the internal executive team, the internal board and then finally it needs to receive shareholding minister approval. Across that entire process are dozens of govt red tape jobs, hired consultants, long winded processes, etc. there are 101+ people who “add value” by doing everything in their power to kill the proposal, but very few who will try and make the proposal work. Thats the current situation we have, where we have the majority of govt employees doing everything in their power to stop other employees from actually actioning investment that would improve the lives of Queenslanders. Getting anything approved is an arduous uphill battle…. The worst though, is that despite all the work you put in to get a proposal up, someone up the line can easily trickle bullshit down, which means it’s drop everything on the go, and focus on the ministers latest shiny object. Ever heard of the square root law? Basically informal tongue in cheek rule that says “the number of effective workers is equal to the square root of the total”. For government it’s probably closer to a cube root law.
22. Is their budget published anywhere online? Searches just resolve useless news articles, I want to see their actual breakdown.
23. To be honest after nearly a decade in power I don't doubt there is quite a lot of bloat in the public service that a new government will feel they can trim It's inevitable that jobs for mates and duplicates exist. It would bee foolish for the LNP to replicate the hatchet job Newman attempted but it's equally foolish to believe that the current work force doesn't need a good refinement with a new set of eyes
24. Here comes another one term. 😂 If he makes it in.
25. There's a song that sums up exactly how the LNP has even a shadow down of a chance of winning this election. You might have heard of this little ditty by a band called Midnight Oil? It's called *Short Memory*
26. Considered? He's almost a sure thing. I'd love to see a big upset though
27. You could say the same thing for Australia in general with Morrison, Abbott and probably Dutton next time too. Queensland also only has one house of parliament which is the big problem - means whoever is in power basically has unfettered power.
28. Please don't think we are all like him. We have no choice about voting nor the members they put up for election. Their vetting process for all party's seen non-existent. This guy would be worse than Joh Bijelke-Peterson with his draconian police force all of which has not changed that fuckers influence is still in the force.
29. I think the issue is some people at least are still voting out Palaszczuk rather than voting for Miles or Crisafuli I do wish she left earlier to give Miles more time
30. A gen z guy at work told me he voted LNP because he’s worried about youth crime. I asked him if he knew who Campbell Newman was or what he did when he was premier and he had no idea at all.
31. My wife went early voting yesterday and said she was sad to realise just how many LNP flyers were around her, together with One Nation.
32. The 2013 federal election was worse. We voted in Abbott. Who promised to be a wrecking ball, and he was, with no upside.
33. >this feels like the first election I've ever experienced in this country where I will lose respect for someone that votes differently to me Not old enough to have to vote for scummo / turnbull/ Abbott? I'd upload a video about it if I had fast enough internet.
34. That’s it, the other side are all stupid and greedy!
35. Their treasury spokesperson committed to maintaining the current coal royalty tiers across the four-year forward estimates when releasing their costings yesterday
36. Yeh as I’ve said before, being tough on crime but saying “adult crime adult time” doesn’t work it’s a much deeper issue related to epidemic drug use in low income communities etc. But yeh let’s just build prison camps for these kids which will only enforce there “fuck authority” mentality.
37. Which is why the bipartisan committee on tackling youth crime recommended regulations on media misinformation demonising QLD youths which would ironically keep them more likely to commit crime. Suddenly however when this was recommended, the LNP no longer supported it and completely pulled out of the committee causing it to fall apart back in April. They need to be able to demonise people because the objective facts and data were so clear that the issue is literally at an all time low.
38. You can’t just throw these criminals into a hole and expect the problem to change. We need to make changes so the future generations don’t follow suit and we can break the cycle. My personal thoughts are that we need more support in these problem areas in the form of housing, food and employment. But that creates the “who’s gonna pay for it” conversation..
39. Tough on after crime :) fk all for before crime.
40. It’s social media which means that you know of every crime and potential crime in your suburb, and the algorithms love that shit because naturally you want to know if someone is checking doors or whatever. And the cameras are there to show it. The fact that 95% of the people who got robbed left their side door unlocked and their car keys on the kitchen table is the part that tends not to get shared, with apologies to the 5%.
41. Same in my neighbourhood, though 9 times out of 10 it is always the same kid. Or not even a kid at all, usually POS adults going around checking cars and houses, so it's still only a small drop in the bucket to brandish it as 'youth crime' from these pages, but yes, it does give the community a sense of crime being rife. But I think the thing that did it in tandem with this was that old cunt with the sob story about his daughter and unborn grandkids being run over by a youth out on bail, this ad was literally everywhere u could see or hear something. And this is the problem because 10000000000% that old cunt and his mowed down family don't even exist...
42. Sadly, the other potatohead isn’t much better. Time to move back to aotearoa?
43. ‘Gave us’ …you mean used our tax dollars to pay for this.
44. state government has nothing to do with negative gearing and franking credits, so i'm not sure what your point is
45. When Labor have been in power at the state level, almost constantly, for 30 years, what does that say about the influence of the courier fail? It’s an irrelevant rag that survives on having a decent crossword. It’s not the power people think it is.
46. The reason many are doing it is they think it’s time for a change because they’ve been in there too long. You’re overthinking this one a bit. A bit of those might be there but it’s mainly ‘time for a change’.
47. How do you think the QLD state election will impact franking credits?
48. It’s called living within your means. Labor may be able to buy your vote but they’re paying for it with your grandchildren’s money.
49. Local Government is the redheaded step child of politics. The State Government is embedded in the Constitution, whereas local government exists because the State Government wants it to. To extend the metaphor, Local Government is the child the State had from a previous marriage. As you pointed out, the State Government has responsibility for a lot of essential services, which is why it is important.
50. Not so much landslide any more. Limping over the line
51. Funny. MAGA republicans say the same the thing about Donald Trump.
52. Crime rates are at their lowest levels ever if you check the stats. There had been a very recent up tick, but that's due to inflation/cost of living, which Labor is stemming with recent changes. All crime, not just youth, will increase once libs are in. Sure, they will make a couple of tough examples of youths that do the wrong thing, but I guarantee if they get in, statistically there will be an increase in crime.
53. Since you have to vote, why not take the effort to do it properly?
54. It’s chalk and cheese. Name one single thing that Crisafulli has ever done for any person or part of the community when he has been in a position to do so? E.g. he was the Townsville Deputy Mayor for two terms - can you find a verifiable example of anything good he did for everyday people? Not for businesses or mining corporations, just normal people trying to live and work in QLD. I tried to find one and there is nothing. I put it to the entire subreddit two weeks ago and no one could find a single verifiable thing. Can you?
55. Nope. I think he’s proven that. What he did for those kids at the museum with Debbie Kilroy proves that. So no and Crisafulli is demonstrably a piece of shit.
56. You disqualify yourself from being able to take a stance against domestic violence. You have either voted for, or will vote for a party with policies that will cause more of it.
57. Both of them are Australian, now fuck of with your racist bullshit. Dumb fucker can't even distinguish two very different and distinct countries and cultures.
58. Comments that are meant as hate speech will be removed immediately and users banned. https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy
59. Essentially, they make you PAY to use the ambulance unless an absolutely critically life-threatening emergency is the reason for the callout. So basically, unless the ambulance is LITERALLY the only way to keep you alive, fuck you pay me!
60. I never thought they weren’t but the ALP were going nowhere under AP and needed a kick in the pants and initially Miles looked like he was just the sacrificial lamb until it turned out he actually had substance.
61. Queensland politics. Every few years there's a landslide as they get rid of a hated government, just to vote them back in again a few years later thinking they have definitely changed.
62. Privatisations! You get a privatisation! Ambulances get a privatisation! Schools get a privatisation! Everyone gets a privatisation!!
63. LNP always gets a free ride. The same people who bitch and whinge about debt and deficits are the same people who will vote for the LNP thinking they’re better economic managers. I’m glad for once even the media is ripping into the LNP about this.
64. Especially when the election is probably just about over with all the pre-poll voting these days. Buyer regret could set in early this time around.
65. Wait what? Why the actual fuck is that a thing fuck I hate these cunts
66. And no surprise why: people will be jobless just before Christmas.
67. To be fair Labor also only released its costings today to I believe. The key difference being that Labor being in government released a budget back in June. Still they announced 9.7 billion in new spending not in that budget (according to the ABC). The LNP is cutting 6.8b currently being spent on consulting fees, so assuming that is correct would not be gutting public service jobs (just KPMG ones lol). Not sure how that would affect the public services ability to operate though.
68. Less than 24 hours because it was released when a media blackout started. Nobody saw it until after the election. Many people who postal or early voted for LNP also wanted to swap votes come election time but it was too late
69. Did you vote for that major constitutional amendment and advisory body despite not knowing how much it would cost? I guess any amount is easy to swallow after spending $450 million on it
70. I left the moment labour lost. The writing was on the wall. But fuck me my fellow kiwis are dumb. Thought Australians would be smarter.
71. True, but no extra money allocated to replace that expenditure. The LNP seems to have costed savings by not taking an option without costing the alternative option taken. "I've saved $1800 a day by not dining exclusively at Michelin star restaurants." Great, but you are still spending on food, right? Right? (You don't get to bank those savings regardless of whether you spent them or not.)
72. Trim or slash? There’s a difference. I hope people think VERY carefully what they’re voting for. This being Queensland, I’m not hopeful.
73. News media had originally suggested a landslide LNP victory was coming. Now they're saying they'll see a very tight LNP victory. Even traditionally pro Coalition media like Sky News have been ripping Crisafulli apart with how big a fuckwit he's been acting to journalists this past month.
74. I am a Queenslander 😀 This is mainly because regional and Gold Coast voters have gone conservative for some reason.
75. Imagine knowing a guy is discount Ron De Santis and still voting him in.
76. Yeah. You're spot on. Miles has been hamstrung from the get go. I never thought I'd say it. But the guy actually seems legit with being upfront. Not all smoke and mirrors.
77. The counter argument is the polling never shifted during the past ten months, so time as Premier wasn't a main factor. It's the election that's been the vehicle that has allowed Miles to lead a Labor resurgency, especially as the public only pay attention during the final two weeks of an election campaign.
78. But would having more time have helped him? I’m from NSW so haven’t been paying that close attention but every time I see him I get smug twat and barely competent vibes. The liberal guy on the other hand has child predator vibes so, miles seems the lesser of 2 evils.
79. The bipartisan committee for tackling youth crime fell apart earlier this year because one of their key recommendations was to implement regulations against political misinformation that demonised Queensland youths. All of the sudden when that was recommended the Opposition were no longer interested in cooperating on tackling youth crime. This is also about the time criminologists studying the matter that had become so politicised started noticing that youth crime is literally at the lowest point its ever been in the state's entire history and all the crime trends were coming from 30-39 year olds. The Coalition is only interested in tackling crime if they're allowed to mislead the public and manipulate them because it's the only way that they can convince people an issue exists.
80. My business colleague is 65. He is voting because of youth crime. He lives in a secure building in Hamilton. Never seen any crime. I told him youth crime is down over the last 20 years and showed him the data. He wouldn’t believe it as it was from the Government (agency operated by). I said who would you prefer to release the data? He said the Police. My wife yelled at him from the other room, “that’s the government you imbecile!” 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
81. Yes, every Gen Z worker of mine told me they voted LNP but also have no idea who Campbell was. Even the women I work with voted LNP knowing it could potentially effect our health care rights
82. Sunshine Coaster here. The LNP corflutes outnumber all the other candidates’ by 10-1. It’s crazy especially considering we’re a pretty conservative area.
83. I mean yeah, guilty as charged. I'm 30 and have voted since I was able to but it never seemed like such a dire choice. I always felt lucky that our elections felt "low stakes" compared to USA in that whoever wins, it's still just Australia and we'll be fine. Perhaps I was just younger and naive, and the issues that affect/move me now are different. I'm willing to accept I've been an ignorant voter for a long time, and that my initial comment might display my naivety. Always just went greens -> labour -> LNP because the environment has been my greatest political issue since I was young, and admittedly grew up in a pretty disadvantaged household so LNP never struck me as a party that gave a shit about my family. Now I'll be putting labour above greens to try and push the realistic option ahead of the obvious "villains" as I see them this cycle. Regardless, I definitely feel the stakes are pretty different this time around. Edit: In relation to my initial comment, I never felt any resentment for people voting in their best interests in the past, but this time around it feels like anyone who votes for LNP is just an asshole, straight up 😬
84. Yeah, they might. And I'm gonna resent half the state for it. Ignorant cunts everywhere.
85. I know how it sounds, that's why I said "I hate to say it", but in this case it's actually true. If you fall for this muppet's lies you're a fool.
86. Thankyou, it’s so hard to find any details, all I can find are short articles with a few bullets in
87. well you can. To say this hasn’t worked in other countries is a bit naive *cough* El Salvador for example. Extreme - absolutely.
88. It's always people too ignorant to actually do any research who think that all politicians are just as bad as each other...
89. Well yeah, glad to see it being put to good use, there's only so many phoney carparks I'm willing to chip in for.
90. This is what taxes are for u literal shit stain. Making the country better for it's people. And this shit does. Dont tell me u like to pay more on ur power bill? Pay extra on ur car rego? Or did u just take that shit for granted and not think it affects u... I can guarantee 100% this really really helped someone u know, probably even someone real close
91. Did you know that all of these measures literally reduce inflation? It's pretty simple mathematically, it's the sum of costs in a previous period vs the current period. How much was your power bill this month/quarter, I bet you $1000 it was less than the previous quarter.
92. I said “and LNP in general”, as in at all levels of government
93. It is the power people think it is as part of Murdoch Media, but it takes generations to move past something as insane as Bjelke-Petersen and the Fitzgerald Inquiry. That's why Labor has been so empowered the past 3 decades ultimately.
94. Look at how Queenslander vote at the other two levels of government. Then look at what I said about a politician having to *really* fuck up to get bad press. Labor’s dominance at the state level is because the LNP has fucked up that bad
95. Exactly.. We've had the proven and sustainable growth party for too long. Time to give the wrecking ball and pollution party a go.
96. Where do you think they all got the same thought from? See point 1…
97. Didn't they deliver the largest budget surplus for any state or territory in Australian history? Then again, I wouldn't expect your average lnp voter to remember something that happened last week, much less last year. And the reason the boomer's grandkids can't afford a house until they have grandkids of their own is thanks to LNP at a federal level.
