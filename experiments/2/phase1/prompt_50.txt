Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. You are lying. Again. LNP members were quizzed on that on ABC coverage. Amanda Stoker bit her tongue in the middle of a sentence when asked, before repeating the party line, which is ‚Äúit‚Äôs not in our plan‚Äù. Not ‚Äúthey won‚Äôt be changing‚Äù - that‚Äôs you lying and sowing disinformation. They have said no such thing, and DC has refused constantly to say it out loud on record. KAP is their ‚Äúuseful tool‚Äù to attack those rights, because they can say ‚Äúoh, it was a conscience vote‚Äù.
2. Yep but it‚Äôs just the message it sends, it makes us feel unwanted and hated, even if it has no practical effect. I do wonder what the LNP have in store for us this term. Palasczcuk on the other hand did a lot in her first term to bring our rights into the 21st century. For example she looked into historical cases where people were charged and convicted of a crime for ‚Äúhomosexuality‚Äù, especially during the 70s and 80s under Sir Joh where qld police would pretend to be gay at a gay bar and then charge someone if they later initiated sexual contact. She apologised to these people and as far as possible expunged the criminal records from it. Bligh and Beattie never did that and it never would have happened under an LNP government.
3. That‚Äôs because he didn‚Äôt know if he‚Äôd need Katter or not. Now he does not.
4. lol no one is pro hamas. Being against the genocide that the IDF is perpetrating is not the same as supporting terrorists.
5. The LNP just won power. They are not going to jeopardise staying in another term by supporting this
6. You understand legal abortions existed before the law was changed don‚Äôt you?
7. I dont think they will.. I think he was only taking that position because they thought it would be tight and didn't want to put off any of the more conservative voters. Which is not a great position granted...
8. Where did they say they wanted to put them in adult prisons? We have purpose built juvenile facilities which will do fine. And I actually agree something needs to change. 3 weeks ago my neighbour got their cars (both of them) stolen by a "kid" who was already on bail for 41 like offences... what part of that system exactly do you think is working?? Cause its clearly fucking not!
9. Time will tell i guess. But I am highly sceptical
10. Comment respectfully. Continued harassment may result in you being banned.
11. Haha nah.. good one actually. Thanks for asking. Typical.. reverts to insults. You have actually made zero points.
12. When they are killing male babies does it become my business because they are the same sex as me?
13. This would be a tremendous public service to the community. Just look at how many people don't even know the voting history of the lnp.
14. The start of your last paragraph sums up different ideologies really simply. Voting "against' something rather than "for".
15. Free lunch at public school would do more to address the root cause than any punishment ever would.
16. You should read the thread I‚Äôve got going on üòÇ
17. it makes sense tho, if ur a kid who murdered someone or a pet or came close to. u deserve adult time, idc if u grew up impoverished or whatever
18. Of course it‚Äôs a huge issue in some areas. You shooting your mouth off when likely you have no knowledge either way does not make it go away. Ask the people of Townsville what they think‚Ä¶.
19. Agreed. I‚Äôm in one of those and I can assure you it is a problem here. Our Facebook pages have daily photos and posts, and there‚Äôs a lot - individuals and small groups caught on CCTV trying car and house doors, groups of kids driving cars that are clearly not theirs (people have discovered their car was stolen that way), etc. Our numbers may or may not show us any worse for crime than other cities per capita, but we definitely have youth criminals blatantly running around, with elements of organisation, who anticipate few consequences. (Doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm thrilled by the election result, but I would take it as a consolation prize if he can actually improve the situation). (Edit to add) We‚Äôre not scared to leave our house or live here now, and we wouldn‚Äôt leave, it‚Äôs still the best place we‚Äôve ever lived. But when we bought our investment properties we did make sure to buy one in a gated community so we would have an option if it ever got to the point, as we got older and more frail, that we didn‚Äôt feel safe anymore.
20. Here we go someone bringing rational thought to the conversation.
21. If your not catching and arresting these cunt kids then that's not included in the statistics either
22. You can‚Äôt single out a certain group. It has to been seen as equal
23. I think you‚Äôve got that ass backwards. Overall it‚Äôs not a problem, the statistics are clear on that. But there may be pockets where it is a problem
24. They *always* make it one. Every time there is an election coming up in a Labor held state you get flooded with news about it. Not just news, but the almost daily fake posts about how "I got assaulted today in the city, its getting so bad" etc etc.
25. And then have claimed that the state has chosen ‚Äúhope over fear‚Äù by electing them üôÑ
26. It probably was an issue for the people who have been victimised though.
27. Simply not true. You are twisting statistics to suit your stance. Statewide statistics don‚Äôt reflect actual issues. Everyone knows the youth crime is horrible in FNQ regional centres.
28. Yes. They are saying there would be value in having one.
29. Exactly my point. A simple majority can get sweeping changes without any compromise
30. Didn‚Äôt One Nation at some point receive money from the NRA?
31. Stoker really _hated_ having to say it ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt on our plan‚Äù - you could tell by the way she had to stop herself in the middle of a sentence and change it - she was about to say something else for sure.
32. And why does an entity like a person, business, or state engage in a contract which places them in debt? I'm sure there a few reasons. Can you list a couple? ü§î
33. Except when you have a surplus, you can pay down debt. I mean, it's not a hard concept to grasp. Just like the fact that having a government spending money to provide services is what a government is for. Or do you think the party in power should sit atop a pile of gold like some very boring and uncharismatic version of Smaug?
34. This. Repayments on debt are an expense. The surplus is when income exceeds expenses!
35. Yes, but please remember that the gov borrowed to give the $1000 energy rebate. That has to be paid back at some point which means instead of feeling the pinch 3 months ago, we'll feel it in the next 3 years at some point. That $1k helped me a lot and I appreciate it but that doesn't mean it's good policy. Who knows, maybe it helped advert a greater economic disaster but I'm not sure. But what it definitely can't do is control inflation, if anything it could make it a bit worse in the medium term. On top of this those benefits mainly help Brisbane but not rural areas. Rural qld doesn't really use or have access to public transport. This showed in the election with rural seats flipping. Both parties have been bringing in mass immigration to try to increase growth, which hasn't worked as they expected. This has caused a housing crisis. Qld ALP started social housing sites which may reduce tents but still have high pressure on demand. LNP has committed to more stock which means urban sprawl and fights with environmentalists. We'll see what happens i guess
36. ‚ÄúNo one is saying youth crime is down across the board. But the data shows that, over a 10-year period, it‚Äôs been decreasing.‚Äù Yes all ‚Äúcrime‚Äù is decreasing - mostly due to fewer drug related crimes. But over the last 4 years, assault, motor theft and b&e are all increasing, and that is the thing that aligns with people‚Äôs experience. Edit: and hang on, yes, people are definitely claiming crime overall is down. And if you claim that the singular category ‚Äúcrime‚Äù is decreasing over 10 years, you are absolutely implying that crime is down wtf are you talking about and it‚Äôs *especially* bizarre to talk in 10 year terms if the government has only been in 8 years and the previous government got voted out because it was too aggressive in its approach bordering on draconian reducing crime And as for ‚Äúwhat kind of data point as that?‚Äù -it‚Äôs a data point that speaks directly to how people are *feeling* about crime - and that‚Äôs what drives election results. Sure, it‚Äôs a disputable statistic from a survey, but I have to say it‚Äôs interesting how many people on here see the comment and agree with it, and it‚Äôs certainly my experience in Brisbane, everyone has either had a car stolen or had their neighbour‚Äôs house broken into. it‚Äôs pretty clear people generally *feel* that crime is up, and that‚Äôs because crime that people are most likely to directly experience, motor theft or assault, is up, and for some reason people want to play word games and say ‚Äúyeah but *all* crime is down‚Äù‚Ä¶ well we saw how that dismissive approach went.
37. Yes as I said, each of the cats I named are up notably
38. That‚Äôs the rub - the targeting shouldn‚Äôt be by the criminal justice system. There are other agencies that are better placed to intervene (and yes, some of them are Federal, _Centrelink_). To use a slogan I adopt a lot, this needs to be treated almost as a public health problem, not a criminal justice problem. QLD Labor recognised that with drugs (which, no doubt, LNP will roll back in mere minutes to appear ‚Äútough on crime‚Äù), but all major parties on a policy platform level fail to recognise that with regard to youth recidivism. And I include the Greens in that.
39. ‚ÄúJail for life for robbery? Might as well stab the victim, lower chance of getting caught that way!‚Äù
40. But what is to be done with juveniles who commit violent crime? What is to be done to protect society from those committing crimes now? There is case just recently in NSW where a 17 year old broke into the home of an elderly couple, sexually assaulted an 88 year old woman, and was give no jail sentence, straight onto parole. What impact is that going to have on the life of that elderly couple? Imagine the fear the must now live in? How must the family of the elderly feel, knowing this 17 hear old got essentially no punishment for this heinous crime? I understand that the criminal system might not be the best for rehabilitation, but what about justice? Is that something the left has decided is no longer important? Seems like it's a bitter pill for victims to have to swallow? Just suck it up, the person that wronged you isn't going suffer any punishment because it might inconvenience them for future job prospects?
41. I understand that. What I am saying to you is I am not surprised when people have their experiences dismissed by being told they‚Äôre stupid and emotional, or by being told the things they experiencing and the people around them are experiencing aren‚Äôt happening, that they decided to vote for a change while knowing it probably wouldn‚Äôt fix the longer term problem for these kids but would probably fix their shorter term problem of being victims of crime and being scared.
42. I don‚Äôt think you per se and maybe I‚Äôm now more just angry about the it‚Äôs FNQ fault or FNQ are hicks comments But I personally just want to feel safe and the current programs haven‚Äôt done that for me. Maybe liberals programs won‚Äôt either but you can‚Äôt blame me for wanting something or anything Like most Queenslanders I want a better Queensland but I also feel so disenfranchised within the 2 party system that I almost don‚Äôt even care who gets in because I don‚Äôt genuinely believe these people care about me or my struggles or even the struggles of my neighbour
43. If you don't know right from wrong at 15 you should be locked up People act like you suffer from a partial lobotomy until the age of thirty
44. It would be a real incentive to cutting the crime rate that's for sure At that rate it would take 3500 criminals off the street for the same cost of the 50c fares. Using this years police figures, around the same number of arrests for unlawful use of a motor vehicle in Brisbane (but we all know there are people with multiple arrests for the same crime)
45. yeah it‚Äôs terrible. in the meantime my spouse and i have moved in, spouse has quit their job along with my brother in law as the caring tasks need 2 people now. my fil and i both work away (mining) just to keep up with the costs. it‚Äôs fucked üòÇ thank you for your kind words and letting me vent
46. Hospitals are in deep shit already. I shudder to think what these fuckwits will do to an already struggling health system in the next 4 years.
47. Really fun time to be a healthcare worker, as if getting through COVID has been a holiday
48. And that recovery is about to be absolutely shit on. GCUH already has massive issues that need fixing. They are about to be in deep shit.
49. If ‚Äúnot my circus, not my monkeys‚Äù was a voter base‚Ä¶
50. Yep. My partner‚Äôs disabled and is on a public waiting list to get diagnosis and effective treatment. Even moderate cuts to the healthcare system can set them back years on the path to getting their life back on track. 4 years of batshit funding decisions is going to severely affect their quality of life for the foreseeable future.
51. All this mining talk makes me laugh, you know the referendum was bankrolled by and stood to hugely benefit mining and resource companies?
52. You are the type of person that takes a shit and because the poo is brown, you say sorry and feel for it before fushing it down the toilet. Always referencing race and the colour of someone. I dont care if it is an Asian that breaks into a house, I dont care if it is an African that kills a grandma, I dont care if it is an Islander that steals a car, I dont care if it is a white person that steals someones purse and is in a vehicle pursuit with the cops. Race doesnt mean anything to me and it doesnt impact my daily life or how I vew others. The only time Race is even in my head is when someone or some organistation talks about it with their white guilt. And honestly, I don‚Äôt care if a certain race or area gets targeted more by police or laws‚Äîif people are committing serious crimes and breaking social norms, they deserve to face the consequences. It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúdisproportionate impact‚Äù; it‚Äôs about not committing heinous acts in the first place. If you don‚Äôt want to be a target, don‚Äôt steal cars, don‚Äôt break into houses, and don‚Äôt terrorize communities. The law‚Äôs there to protect society, and if some groups end up in trouble more often, maybe the focus should be on fixing that behavior, not making excuses for it. And before you try and bring racism onto me again, I am an islander myself and work with troubled kids.
53. Thank you very much for this ‚ù§Ô∏è and yes, definitely a woman.
54. Well I'll come back and withdraw my claim.shes being overdramatic when a bill is passed in parliament withdrawing her access to the contraceptive pill. What age do you think we live in that this would ever happen in Australia?
55. >disabled woman Yep, assuming genders now, cant be civil can you?
56. i mean the past few years has arguably been shithouse so i don't see how it can get any worse. i genuinely don't see how this will affect my day to day but let's see
57. Nope. You are wrong. But come back & crap on in 4 years
58. He voted against decriminalisation in the first place. His members - bar three of them - also did. We know exactly what he will do if KAP gives him the opportunity, and your disinformation will not work.
59. If you don't even know what the candidates were saying during the campaign then how can you say anything with confidence
60. Oh so you've seen the new proposed legislation then have you?
61. What‚Äôs done is done, now. I really hope in 4-years time that people are able to call me a fool, and that I am overreacting, I really do. However, based on historical facts of the LNP, I don‚Äôt believe people will be afforded that opportunity. If you are on the side of the people trying to take away 50% of the populations right to choose (and the conservative nutters had their right to choose not to get abortions), then you really are on the wrong side of history, friend.
62. They didn't say they would put them in adult jails. But that's where they'll end up. Because we don't have the capacity in our current facilities.
63. Then why didn't the LNP rule out a conscience vote? If they plan to keep the current laws, a conscience vote is not required. This is a childlike attempt at lying by omission
64. Probably because of the Labor government being in power for so long? üôÑ
65. WOAH EASE UP YOU MIGHT TAKE MY HEAD OFF COUNT BOOMULA
66. No. It‚Äôs still between a woman and her healthcare professionals (QLD law requires two professionals to consult with her to make sure that it‚Äôs her choice and hers alone). Get fucked. And no babies are killed. Foetuses aren‚Äôt sentient. Science also tells you to get fucked. As a male, I tell you: fuck off. This is not our business. And it never will be. If you think it is, it means you think women are lesser beings. And that makes you scum.
67. I can't even fathom anyone caring about that with everything else being tossed into the election, what possible issue could there be with giving kids lunch ffs? Some people really can't see the forest from the trees.
68. Now kids will get three meals a day in prison üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è
69. Are you serious? A free lunch is the answer to youth crime? How ridiculous!
70. Not against this one bit. Adult crime adult time. But where does it end. The prisons are that overpopulated that they run on a in and out policy. For every person that goes in, one person is released. Depite the remaining time they have left. So what‚Äôs the answer, build more prisons raise taxes on an already struggling nation. Do we bring back capital punishment. Open more youth centers or bring in mandatory military service. There are so many options, but we live in a free country. Free to choose the life we want. Does that mean we go to a state of communism. What is truly the good choice. Education does work, but only if the individual wants to truly change. Violence brings violence, we see this every day. Personally, I have no idea what the solution is. Do we remove money or the concept of value. This brings its own inherit set of problems. Until the day comes where everyone is seen and treated as an equal, will it ever change. Even this has its own set of problems. The end game being someone will always want to be on top. It‚Äôs human nature. To be the best. I for one am glad I live in Australia you only need to turn on any form of media be it mainstream or back door media. It‚Äôs all violence, war, religion, greed. When was the last time anyone watched how a a common working class person who has struggled their whole life providing for his/her ( or one of the 130+ pronouns we now have) family who got cancer and beat it and is now a happy healthy person. You won‚Äôt see it. BeCause as a race we feed on seeing less fortunate then ourselves. It makes us feel better to know that there are people worse off we are so desensitized to murder and mayhem now. If someone can prove me wrong on this I am more than willing to listen. I for one would love to hear how it‚Äôs not true. Until this changes the world we live in will keep following this path we are on. Honestly how many generations are left to come. The way things are heading I see maybe 6 at best. We live in the moment and this is our moment.
71. It‚Äôs become more obvious because more people have CCTV than they used to, and we now have Community Facebook groups/ social media to talk it about, but that‚Äôs not evidence that it has increased. Yes, there are definitely pockets throughout QLD, notably Townsville, Cairns, and GC that do have greater problems than other areas, but on average, rates of youth crime are falling. Regardless, the ways that the LNP intend to address this issue will not solve the underlying problem so it‚Äôs really a moot point. Numbers may continue to fall and the LNP will take the credit for something they had no hand in. If you want to get all up in arms about something you should be looking more toward domestic violence, sexual assaults and murder of women, particularly by men known to them, where those rates have significantly increased.
72. This is a dumb take. The way the legal system works is 1. Person (victim) reports something happened 2. Police record this as a crime and begin investigating etc. Or don't. But this is when the crime is counted. 3. Try to find the perpetrator 4. Charge perp with committing the crime. 5. Court system. As soon as you get to step #2 it counts as a crime. The only potential crimes that aren't included are when (a) it isn't reported, or (b) it's reported but not taken seriously / police don't want to act on the report.
73. I mean the individual youths. Not all youths in general. And if the police are not allowed to single out criminals, that pretty much renders them useless.
74. Just because it‚Äôs not a problem where you live doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not a problem.
75. And that's how you lose an election. Tell people with real problems that there's no problem. Did you ask where they are from and what is thier experience before you told them that they are wrong about their life? Do you think that makes them want to vote Labor? I actually voted for labour but it's an arrogant tribe full of hate speech against anyone they disagree with and it's intolerant of different ideas. I voted for them because the government departments I work with are well run and their 50 cent transport policy. They lost and will keep losing while they support hate speech and intolerance of potential swing voters. That's just how marketing and psychology works. You can't insult people into supporting you.
76. Well come out into the real world and have a look.
77. There was footage of a meeting. Can't recall if money actually changed hands but they were doing deals.
78. No. Ashby desperately wiggled his buttocks and got Pauline to wiggle hers but failed to convince the Russians that they were significant enough to fund.
79. Nah, but I'm sure it'd look that way to you ü§°
80. > Yes, but please remember that the gov borrowed to give the $1000 energy rebate Governments borrow. This isn‚Äôt news. However, Queensland has a balance sheet that makes it a non-issue. The state has many assets that return a good profit, resulting in a headline surplus after servicing that debt. Unless the LNP sells ‚Äòem all off, or we get another Bligh-style Labor government who sells ‚Äòem all off. > which means instead of feeling the pinch 3 months ago, we'll feel it in the next 3 years at some point Now that we‚Äôve elected the LNP, you‚Äôre correct. But if we‚Äôd stuck with Labor, that would be completely false - we were on track for a surplus, meaning that even after servicing the debt, the state would be in profit. Of course, that was predicated on making the mining companies pay their fair share, which the LNP has as a priority to reverse. > Both parties have been bringing in mass immigration to try to increase growth, which hasn't worked as they expected Both parties have done no such thing. The Queensland State Government has no power to control immigration one way or the other, both international and interstate.
81. I said down *across the board*. As in, across both short term and long term, and every category of crime.
82. Cool, like I said, do you have the data for that? Can you link it?
