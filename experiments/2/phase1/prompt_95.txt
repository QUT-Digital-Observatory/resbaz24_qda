Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. do you also think the "rocket" "bullet" or "glider" busses are misleading? just wait till you hear about the adelaide metro, or the dozens of other cities that call their bus metro
2. BCC is just bad at naming these things. You’re right that it’s a level of service, but that still isn’t a transport system. As a user I don’t really care what vehicle it is taking me on the 169 route, I care about frequency and the stops it services. At best, distinguishing Metro 169 from regular bus 169 makes no difference in getting from point A to point B, at worst it creates confusion (particularly for anyone unfamiliar with the nuances of Brisbane transport). Metro is the worst of the names because it actively implies something it is not. The rest are simply not descriptive enough to be intuitive and, arguably, overlap considerably from a functional point-of-view.
3. Bullets aren't a thing, are they? Great Circle Line is another branding name missing. But also, I'd say we already have too many names which would confuse people new to the city. Should be maybe BUZ, and Rocket, that's enough
4. Yeah. BERT sounds like someone tried to come up with a good name and failed. It needs to be either a spectacular name, or it needs to be just a little bit frivolous. I suggest the Bananananana bus.
5. i find it funny that everyone is worried about being "embarrassed" about calling it a metro but oblivious to the irony of being so whingey and whiney about being outraged by the name, the least important part of any project. its far more embarrassing how much everyone is spitting the dummy over what is otherwise a great improvement to our public transport
6. these are high-capacity busses running on dedicated busways at very high frequencies. people are really mad at a name, literally the least important part of any project literally the only difference is the name, everything else (including function) is identical do you also think the "rocket" "bullet" or "glider" busses are "misleading"? ETA: based on the BCC renders, the new Metro route will only have 1 at-grade crossing with pedestrians / traffic
7. Yes, thank you. I did consider including that in the post but many of the search results into that lead back to "[Brisbane Metro](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/traffic-and-transport/public-transport/brisbane-metro)". The Brisbane Subway in the [Detailed Network Strategies for 2031](https://cabinet.qld.gov.au/documents/2010/jul/connecting%20seq%202031/Attachments/4%20-%20connectingseqweb04partc.pdf): >**Brisbane subway** >Toowong to Newstead (first section) providing a high capacity, high-frequency, distributor system connecting central Brisbane destinations and distributing passengers from the bus and rail network across the intensely developed core of inner Brisbane. >**New Brisbane subway** >By 2031 there will be 2.4 million trips per day in inner Brisbane (within about five kilometres from the CBD), up from about one million in 2006. A subway system for Brisbane will support the expected growth and expansion of the inner city. >This will be a new separate network, with separate operations to existing rail infrastructure. The London underground and New York subway are well known examples of this style of rail operation. >The Brisbane subway will provide a high-capacity, high-frequency distributor system connecting central city destinations and linking passengers from the bus and rail networks to destinations not within a comfortable walk of existing stations. >The priority corridor for delivery by 2031 will be from Toowong to West End to Bowen Hills/Newstead. This corridor would be under the CBD and intersect with existing rail and busway stations. Longer-term opportunities to expand the Brisbane subway could include: >• Bowen Hills/Newstead to Airport Village via Hamilton North Shore >• Newstead to Bulimba >• potential conversion of some sections of Brisbane’s busway network to increase public transport capacity. I don't know how widely discussed it is, as didn't hear shit about it during current QLD election if it is considered for delivery by 2031.
8. Sydney Metro is definitely a "metro" in the way most people think of metro systems. It's just a very, very strange use case for one.
9. Sure you are pointing out some interesting facts for public transport enthusiasts like you or me, but I don't think we need to draw the public into a wider "is it a 3-car inner-city express, a metro, a bus or a trackless tram" sort of debate. Ultimately we are still talking semantics here: it is frequent (even in off-peak if you are at an inner-city station you will see one every 7.5 minutes or so), it is dedicated infrastructure (mostly, with slight asterisks as you point out) and it is higher capacity (only 2/3 of a tram, but still large). I don't think either a local or a tourist is going to mind if it went underground or goes on tracks, as long as those above 3 criteria are ticked when they hear the word "metro". Therefore, what reason are we changing the name for? I agree "metro" isn't correct, but it isn't so offensively wrong that we should take money away from something more important just to change it in my view.
10. No I don't, for the same reason OP doesn't. It's not a metro.
11. That's because rockets/bullets/gliders aren't already names used for transportation infrastructure in cities. The word 'metro' absolutely implies something that this isn't, as would words like 'airport', 'tram', 'train'. rocket/bullet/glider don't have that vibe at all. In fact, for all three of these words, there are additional usages and connotations which separate them from their usages as physical objects. For example, 'to rocket' is a verb meaning to move quickly. Wouldn't you know, busses described as 'rockets' are usually express versions! It's almost like they're busses that are moving quickly! 'Glider' is commonly used to describe someone/something who moves smoothly and effortlessly - in this case used to describe a bus. This is also in the name 'city glider' - a bus that moves through the city smoothly and effortlessly. 'Bullet' also generally means to move quickly and is often used in the figurative sense 'as fast as a bullet'. 'Bullet trains' aren't called bullet trains because they are literally bullets - it's because they move quickly. Metro can't be used in any similar way.
12. > dedicated busways Are they? Or do they share with other traffic/pedestrians, like around the Cultural Centre/QPAC region?
13. "Very high frequencies" of 15 minutes. Head back to yank land please.
14. Function is not identical. The capacity of these buses is at most 170. Compare this to Sydney Metro with a capacity of 1,100 per train. The Brisbane version is nowhere near the capacity of a metro. The buses will run on busways, yes. But they share these with other bus routes and share at grade intersections with general traffic. This is not true of a metro. No, I don’t really take issue with the other names because they’re not commonly used transit terms and aren’t being marketed as a new system/network.
15. Sadly, I don’t think it’s on the cards anymore, and definitely not for delivery by 2031.
16. Holy fuck I just read your comment again hahaha haha WHAT metro can’t be used in any other way?!?!? Are you aware of the word metropolitan?
17. Pretty much the biggest benefit, and main goal of this whole project was to eliminate the bottleneck at the Cultural Centre which is a massive chokepoint and strangles the entire busway network. The original proposal would have seen an upgrade to the Cultural Centre, including a tunnel underneath Melbourne Street and new underground platforms for the metro vehicles, eliminating the 90 right hand turn at the end of the current Busway Tunnel, and two at-grade intersections on Melbourne Street itself. For a myriad of reasons, this was scaled back massively and the tunnel section never went ahead, so what we've got now is the exact same setup, just with more and larger vehicles. The Cultural Centre will still be a massive choke point and frankly I can see it becoming quite a dangerous stretch for pedestrians. Definitely not ideal.
18. It was originally going to be underground. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfcJNYPYD7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfcJNYPYD7s) It's often forgotten that Mater Hill was also going to be put underground so the existing busway space could be used to expand the hospital. https://preview.redd.it/o80uxwha0mwd1.png?width=1480&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd81edb7c18cf6d77a5824f821535bca8366a3fb
19. yes lol. there is no sharing with pedestrians even at cultural centre/QPAC, pedestrians go over a bridge
20. sorry i meant identical to a metro that would have been built in brisbane, obviously the alternative was never going to be build a Sydney scale light rail lol > share at grade intersections with general traffic not for the vast majority of the route lol goes to show how much you know no one has yet explained why it matters though. even if they literally called it a hypersonic maglev train when it clearly isnt, who gives a shit? it is fit for purpose and thats all i care about other than "reee its misleading" .... ok? cool? will that impact the intent of it? no? exactly
21. Nobody's getting "so mad" or suggesting it should be scrapped. We're just discussing if it should be renamed.
22. Thanks for the explanation! I have definitely wondered why all the buses choke near there, and what would solve the issue. It definitely seems like a tunnel is the way to go. Maybe we'll get a phase 2 one day
23. That video makes me depressed. What we could have had... 5 years later, and we're still stuck with a pedestrian death trap and a bridge that is basically a defacto bus depot.
24. Well they can, but most use that busy intersection at Grey St, and the end of the Victoria Bridge, where pedestrians, or the metro/buses will have to wait for each other. I guess I'm just curious how 'dedicated' is dedicated.
25. does the name impact the ability of the metro to perform its function? If not, why does it matter what the name is?
26. Grey street will likely be closed as a crossing for that very reason, forcing pedestrians over the bridge. the other end of victoria bridge may even direct pedestrians over the busway by the treasury but even if not, 2 pedestrian crossings for the entire network is hardly enough of a reason to poo-poo a significant improvement to public transport
27. Not really. What's your point? Nobody said it did. That's also not a reason to rename it.
28. So they will build another pedestrian bridge over Grey St, if it's closed as a crossing? To go from Treasury to West End via Melbourne St, is what I mean.
29. So why does it matter what the name is then?
30. looks like grey street at grade crossing will remain. but again, 1/2 crossings over an entire network is hardly enough of a reason to poo-poo a significant improvement to public transport
31. We’re not “poo-pooing” the project exactly we’re explaining why calling it a metro is incorrect.
32. And why does the mane matter? No one has been able to explain that and every time I ask everyone suddenly goes quiet as they realise it doesn’t because it’s just pedantic
33. I’ve replied several times explaining why it’s a bad name. You’re choosing to be ignore the reasons.
34. Did you intentionally ignore my point? I know why it’s a bad name, I’m asking why it matters Calling my car the shaggin’ wagon would be a bad name because it’s a hatchback. But who cares? It still does the job
35. Because words have meaning, using them incorrectly causes confusion. Hope this helps.
36. Confusion how? Oh no this mode of public transport has rubber wheels I expected steel wheels…. Oh well Yet again: ….. and? Why does it matter if some people are confused that a bus is called a metro? This “confusion” will harm no one and cause no issues. I still don’t understand why everyone is so worked up about it as if people are going to see the metro and be so confused they’ll jump in front of it out of confusion
37. The confusion comes from expecting a metro-level of service and reliability and that’s not what this will offer.
38. oh no! people will have to wait 10 mins instead of 5 (sydney metro)! an utter disaster. this is simply the worst thing to happen to brisbane. again, why does it matter if people have to wait a whole 5minutes! ETA: some sources say it will be every 5 mins so identical to Sydney metro lol
39. Really weird how some Australians, are rabidly obsessed with Trump. America is a cesspool, imploding from the inside.
40. A Yougov poll of Australian voters from about a month ago asked if they could vote in the US Presidential Election who would they vote for - Harris 67% Trump 33%. Anecdotally that feels right to me.
41. Haha a Trump supporter asshole spat at me in Melbourne during a rally a few years back. Fucked in the head.
42. No matter how conservative you might be, I don’t understand how any Australian could want Trump to win. We need the US alliance for protection. We’ve heard how little Trump values alliances and protecting democracies. If his Ukraine policy was applied to us, he would be telling us something like “give the CCP all the land to north of Townsville or we’ll pull all support”. What true conservative would support that?
43. Ugh. So gross to see Nazi shit in public here.
44. I just don’t understand why people catching the 50 cent bus care so much about tax cuts for the mega rich
45. I wont be scrutineering this time as I'm not in Queensland for the election. Every poll, state and federal, I've worked on since 2016 has had at least a dozen people "voting" for Trump. It boggles the mind.
46. Trump is some sort of phenomenon that is for sure. It is definitely not a positive message that he spruiks. I think he appeals to the nihilists who have given up on the system and know he intends to burn it down. He is just not that good at anything.
47. Imagine being that sick in the head. The internet is melting people’s brains
48. Can we please not idolise this rapist, insurrectionist, fraudster. We just don’t need that brand of toxic shit here.
49. Whoever put that there, can fuck right off to America
50. He may be the only *man* fit for the job, but the woman is a better choice.
51. I am absolutely baffled at the whole trump shitshow. He is almost a cartoon of himself, but in real life. Like he lives his whole life as a character. Has wife, cheats on her with a pornstar, marries her, then cheats on her with another pornstar. With fraudulent money. His business dealings are like a how to for wannabe movie supervillains. The whole idea that he's a "self made man" when ALL of his money came from Dad, is ludicrous in and of itself. The idea that had the common man's interests at heart in any way is ludicrous. I've hated him as a human ever since I knew who he was. I can't see how anyone can want such a turd of a human, in control of anything. Baffling.
52. Hang on, if the job is raping and being a cunt then he's the best.
53. hope you ripped it off and tossed it in the bin
54. https://preview.redd.it/ijpxn6jwrlwd1.png?width=428&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=baaef66e85e56611fc979f075628e93a7c84628d Can't believe I'm actually saying this.. but I think Matt Walsh was right
55. I really miss the days when anyone with class and those pretending to have it never discussed their political leanings. Thank fuck we don't treat our pollies like demigods here.
56. its quite surprising how some australians are so passionate about trump. the challenges in America right now make it seem like the country is struggling internally.
57. Totally some shit stirrer who planted that sticker, opened reddit, then waited.
58. We see way too much of that orange diarrhea generator.
59. Trump. The Super Rick. Dense, orange and dumb as dogshit
60. I hope you removed this vandalism. It’d do the community a favour. I did this for COVID denier crap and was thanked by a doctor friend.
61. Time to call in ASIO and DHA to pull up these idiots for their possible acts of state subversion.
62. I hope they realise that Australians can't vote in US elections
63. I’m not used to seeing Australians so invested in politics. The amount of propaganda I’ve seen leading up to this election (qld) is insane. I guess nothing wrong with being invested in how the country is run, just not used to seeing so many people outspoken and conflicting with others.
64. I wonder how many people tried/will try voting for Trump and be confused when he isn't on the ballot.
65. So now that group is advocating for immigrants? Because you know... If he's the right man for the job, he'd have to immigrate here? /s
66. Definitely odd. I live in the USA and have yet to see a sticker of Anthony Albanese on the buses here
67. Had a coworker who loved trump despite me trying to point out the flaws in his steadfast beliefs Right wingers are weird
68. I need more context. What job are we talking about?
69. I desperately wanted an explanation for the insanity and immorality of Trump and his supporters before and during his first (hopefully the last) term, and found this video that perfectly explains the Trump phenomenon and the post truth world using theories of group psychology. It's useful for understanding other unfathomable events too. I highly encourage you to check it out. https://youtu.be/SdWG8UiAtpE?si=yo9YVgPpFoLHJwyL
70. I’m an Aussie - and a US citizen. I’m completely appalled by the ridiculous reporting on the US elections. I haven’t seen anything that is reported in Aust that is remotely an accurate depiction of what things are actually like in America on a day to day basis. It is a ridiculous situation - but for people like me who pay tax, own property and have family in the USA, it’s as serious as a heart attack. I’m from a swing state and guess what - my red county has “not received” my ballot (I voted blue). I sat in my office and watched January 6 unfold live on tv. I’m disgusted with any American who still supports him; and as for Australians that may support him - it’s pure ignorance and not grounded in actual experience. 💯
71. Funny though because our own labor seems to be doing everything the Dems are doing in America. Imo down with labor. And rise one nation
72. I'm ok with my opinion. Yours is called cognitive dissonance.
73. This thread is a cesspool of mental illness and lack of understanding about how the world actually works.
74. The main stream media have painted Trump to be an idiot when in fact he is literally draining the swamp from the inside out. The arrests of Epstein and Diddy are the tip of the iceberg which Trump put in motion. He now has JFK Jr on his side who is trying to make it public that the covid vaccines cause injury and turbo cancers. The courts have taken out an injunction against him because he is likely to win. Can yoi imagine the fallout( which is also not on MSM unless you dig for it). Make America Healthy again and Trumps plans to cut Tax's and bring the cost of fuel down hence making food production and distribution aff again is the biggest thing ANY politician has done ever. He is a businessman first and the people love him because he cared about the people. He has made his own money through hard work not from being born into elite silver spoon families. Seriously alot going on that people are not aware of. KH and Biden have allowed millions of illegal immigrants through the border to rob and steal from Americans. Thousands of immigrant children have been separated from family and sold as sex slaves...at the border. So your due diligence and search for the real answers instead of believing the information fed to you by the elite owned media. https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/rfk-jr-wins-deferred-injunction-in-anti-vax-social-media-suit https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/ice-unable-to-track-nearly-300k-immigrant-children-dhs-report/ar-AA1ptdYQ
75. Well Libs are supplying weapons to Israel while Trump is threatening to cut it if both sides won't go back into the table. Remember Syria? The left can keep rallying about peace in the middle east while they're providing weapons or they can go right and just cut weapons supply. It's a bad choice, having to choose the lesser of 2 evils
76. Yeah man it just randomly became cheaper after Obama trashed the economy in 2 years..
77. See nothing wrong with this. Retards would rather Harris. Bruh gtfo
78. Cognitive dissonance. You had the first Vax and your legs gor totally swollen ,.you ended up.in Emergency room. But you still went and had the next booster when told to. And the next.
79. Great quote. When the truth comes out don't ask how we knew but why you didn't know. There are millions out there fighting for global freedom. Soon enough you will see what it's all about.
80. In 2016 after he won, some fwit put all these Trump posters up around Merthyr. Not sure if they were yank or not, but like wtf.
81. Internet has warped the simple minded.. social media has caused most of this chaos.
82. I know quite a few. They're all lonely, middle-aged, and spend way too much time on social media in groups that make them feel welcome and part of a family
83. In NZ here, we get the same. Like others said, it’s social media nonsense being drip fed into other countries. For me, the funniest part is how the same people will talk about how terrible immigration is in America (with racist intent), then vote for the right wing party here that boosts immigration during a housing crisis while public infrastructure continues being underfunded. I don’t think these people really follow any principle or policy, just indoctrination and the “everything I don’t like is woke and woke is bad” ideology.
84. So many people want to be America Jr., and I’m like, “Fucking *why*?”
85. You might have heard about it on the Internet, 'TDS' - it stands for Trump Dicksucking Syndrome.
86. 💯. Driven recently by a owner driver taxi driver who was a member of the liberal party who loves Donald ( the PATHOLOGICAL LIAR) Trump. People who love him are nasty drama addict's.
87. Ehh not really that weird. Combination of our largest combined media outlet being owned by a bloke that wants to turn us into his own little America. Then on top of that you have social media algorithms basically force feeding confirmation bias to its users.
88. The one and only reason abortion has come into play in a QLD state election 🤣
89. I have sometimes wondered if Trump and Maga were big X Files fans back in the 90's tbh. Trump's magnetic aura amongst his supporters does seem a bit stranger than fiction sometimes. I think we will try his style of politics here, but I don't think either major party will be able to adapt to it entirely. It might actually give rise to a four party preferred of Labor, Greens, Liberal and National parties with the Coalition between Liberal and National being ended. And I could then see the Nationals merging with the far right parties like KAP, One Nation and Palmer United and others from there.
90. Seriously. I spent thousands of dollars to leave the US.
91. That’s not true. America has a lot of fantastic qualities and people 🇺🇸 TRUMP and his MAGAts are not included 🇺🇸🇺🇸
92. This actually happens everywhere. For example, I was in Japan from 2018-2023, and I saw a few Trump marches (by Japanese people, 0 whites). Oh, and I lived in a smaller city, not like Tokyo or anything. Which is really weird because you see almost 0 protests or marches in Japan but here we are, 2pm on a Sunday and a hundred or so locals in full support.
93. Rabidly because he is doing so much good and you don't see it on the news.
94. It dropped there was another more recent one.. about 22% support.
95. Highest support for Trump on that poll was in QLD though IIRC
96. I'm very much in favour of more of these polls. Preferably with identifying data
97. Now do Boomers...and it will be 80% Trump and 20% Harris.
98. They’re all a bit fucked in the head down there in melbs
99. It is a mistake to think that thought is involved. They are either wilfully ignorant or just plain stupid.
100. The other day heard someone say Trump was the better candidate "because he's more *decisive*" ummmm ok
101. Trying to apply reason to trump anything will get you nowhere. These people don't care, Trump just says racist and horrible things. Anytime he goes against the grain, they say what he says doesn't matter or say that it's fake or he didn't mean it that way. Look at their reaction to him saying people should get vaccinated for COVID lol.
102. It's beyond me and the rest of the world why a large chunk of dumb Yanks want an old man who shits his pants, can't put a sentence together, gropes and rapes women and hangs out with sex trafficking Pedo's as their President.
