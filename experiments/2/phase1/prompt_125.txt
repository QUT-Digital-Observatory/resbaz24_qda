Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Okay, provide the case number. They're public. I can look them up. Since you can apparently 100% confirm. I'm not sure how, since it would go against sentencing guidelines in the Youth Justice Act for someone to be cautioned for a rape conviction - That would be an easy appeal. So no they can't be cautioned for rape. Children receive about the same sentences as adults. If a child is being 'cautioned' for rape, then so would an adult. A rape sentence in Australia for a 'non violent' rape (I personally hate this term) is quite low, usually less than 3 years. A rape sentence in Australia for a rape where violence was present is about 3 - 5 years. You generally have to do some pretty monstrous things to get a significant rape sentence of 6 or more years. That's why the whole 'adult time for adult crimes' is redundant. There is not a 'child sentence' and an 'adult sentence'. The Youth Justice Act just allows for age to be taken into account in regards to sentencing, which it wasn't before, because we know how brain development affects decision making. A conviction of rape is a conviction of rape. If the jury did not consider the rape to be rape, and simply a misunderstanding of consent, then they would not convict - That's the whole 'doubt' part. Those situations are common, but that has nothing to do with the judges sentencing... because in those decisions there is no 'sentencing' to be done. The jury had reasonable doubt of the defendants guilt. You would have to take issue with the jury. Edit: I am basing this all on the assumption that you do know that *Police* issue cautions. Which is why I am adamant.
2. That's the information Debbie Kilroy, who founded Sister's Inside has been given, & not only that, she's been informed that it won't just be the truant but the siblings who haven't done anything as well. These policies are about breaking up families, as they stand right now. I have given you the source & extra information. It's wild that you're talking about me trying to discredit you but you went to Nazism rofl. Wooooow duuuuude. End of chatty chats.
3. Sydney has OPV and we can vote in Labor governments just fine.
4. I completely understand that you have had a different experience under an LNP government and I respect that you haven't responded back in anger despite some people getting very emotional in this thread. For me personally I don't vote just for my own benefits. Sure they come into play, it's impossible to remove all personal biases. I vote for the greater community and future prosperity and outcomes. When I weigh up what progressive vs conservatives parties have implemented and what their future plans are, I cannot foresee myself voting conservative again. Very clear on the again here because I was once a swing voter. I am now a card carrying Labor member because of not only their track history but also because they have the most coherent future plans. One thing I wish more people would realise is just because you support a party doesn't mean you have to support every decision they make, being dogmatic like that is how we get a US style system. I am very concerned that the LNP (which I once supported) is heading towards US Republican ideology and we don't need that kind of division in Australia.
5. But people should be punished for crimes they committed, not back out on the street free to recommit
6. Just to be clear, I’m being dramatic but you favour riots and burning the place down?
7. ok I was unclear: you are not employable. I believe in the transcendent value of human life and that every person deserves dignity and their minimum needs met. as for not being empathetic, buddy, I've been there. I have clawed my way back from being homeless, more than once. the lesson I learned is to be valuable to others. the public service in QLD, in its current form, is essentially a welfare kindergarten for adult babies that need their dogshit degrees de-risked. again, if the only thing stopping you from being unemployed is the government seal on your payslip: your job is bullshit. you know the worst thing about Crisafulli's government? it WON'T be newman 2.0, because that's what we actually need x2, electric boogaloo. the service is now so bloated, increasing above population growth, and crossing so many palms, that taking the hacksaw to it is politically impossible. the electorate is now both the dealer and the addict because of how many hundreds of thousands are employed in the public service, and we will never be able reduce our using.
8. People who read events with that kind of good faith are already on our side, they don’t need a rally to be convinced. The people who are going to dismiss preemptive rallies and protests are the Murdoch Media and people who believe the Murdoch Media. They’re going to be critical enough of these protests when it’s in response to actual legislation, we don’t need to make their jobs easier by protesting against a shadow. Whatever broad strokes we know of so far are not legislation. It’s nothing concrete. Showing their hand, in this instance, is an actual bill. They already know the general sentiment on our side about abortion. We aren’t telling them anything new with a show of solidarity over a general position they and everyone else are already aware of. When there are actual measures on the table, that’s when we have something to protest against.
9. Your response shows you are a “salty hysterical chicken little”
10. Have you seen how many smoke shops are around? Bike gangs are going well.
11. So no example worthy of hyperbole? What makes me feel less worried is that last time they did a bunch of shit things, but we voted them out in a single term. So I’m confident that if history repeats itself it will in the next election too. However, if they’re more moderate, then we don’t have as much to worry about
12. Please, how many late term abortions were performed prior to 2018 and how many have been performed since? And how many were of healthy pregnancies? Please post evidence that every late term abortion was performed on a non healthy and non viable pregnancy and I will gladly admit that those terminations would have been allowed to occur even under the old laws. If there are no abortions of healthy and viable late term pregnancies, then why is the pro-abortion lobby so against putting safeguards in place? I'll wait for you to provide that proof, by the way.
13. That literally says net debt is forecast to increase due to decreased resources royalties & infrastructure projects. Despite net debt being "only" $24 billion, the state is paying interest on the entire $132 billion, and that's set to increase. They can't liquidate every asset to pay it off. Nothing has been misrepresented except your claim that the state's debt is fractional to what it really is.
14. There are different types of cautions: those given by police, and those given by the courts. I’m saying that rape committed by child offenders can and is given a caution by police. Perhaps I should have specified that I was talking about police cautions in my first comment. Under the legislation, police must consider cautioning child offenders before sending them to court. Certainly there are a number of circumstances that must be considered before a police caution is given, but it certainly happens. Thus, the rape case never sees the inside of a court room.
15. Ah mate, I couldn't agree more. This whole dogmatic/tribalism is sending us all backwards. I do agree that the national LNP is veering towards Republican/Semi-Evangelical level, which I personally can't get on board with. I do like Albo as a figured head, he seems really likeable. The association with the Greens party makes me uneasy, especially their proposed tax unrealised captial gains in superannuation. But it appears he's distanced himself from that bill. The emotion attached is crazy. I really don't know how the mantra of some people saying "you're either with us or against us" is healthy. I guess I've circled back to my original message that got lost amongst the anger. We're all in this state together. Let's stop the nastiness and try to get along.
16. So I'm being hyperbolic because I take people's concerns about losing their job seriously? When the LNP have a history of doing exactly that?
17. Policing and justice isn’t or shouldn’t be about retribution. Not with kids. When a child offends, it’s the governments fault. Government needs to step in and provide proper mental health, familial, and environment rehabilitation.
18. The same kids are spending more time in watch houses. Bail unmade, their parents aren’t interested, some are homeless. What do they have but criminal lifestyle? What help can they get- education, support, therapy for conduct issues?
19. In context, if it was necessary, I am in favour of mass protests. In the event that the people aren't heard then riots would be the next step. Unfortunately there are people who take it too far. I'm not in favour of that, but you shouldn't need that explained to you like you're a preschooler, because I didn't say that.
20. Whatever mate. It just boils down to “I don’t think I need it so it’s a waste of money” so slash public services until the system collapses. Again we tried the LNP and the fucked them selves straight back out of power.
21. A lot of weird fetishes? With the LNP's track record of producing rapey cunts I'm not surprised.
22. What like building infrastructure? For his faults (being the wrong team for th3 socialists) he managed to borrow and build airportlink tunnels. He also, magnamounously I believe , changed the law in Queensland to ALLOW the labor party to not lose party status in Queensland b3caus3 th3y jad so few seats they were not legally a party anymore, that gave them hug3 funding that they would have lost. It's easy f4om the cheap seats but that last point allowed labor to come back and mount a credible challenge, and he couldv3 gone nah fuck em. So that's a plus from my perspective for d3mocracy even if there's nothing I can see labor did in their small target strategy in 10 years that was long lasting and in the publics interest.
23. Babies being born alive and left to die, is that the one you meant? Or assisted dying? Or did you read your beliefs in the guardian?
24. ‘South Australia is one of the only states to collect and publish their abortion data; over 90% of abortions in that state occur in the first trimester each year, with less than 2% occuring after 20 weeks gestation. The majority of post-20 week procedures are provided for fetal reasons.’ https://www.preventivehealth.sa.gov.au/assets/downloads/abortion-reporting/SA-Abortion-Reporting-Committee-Annual-Report-2023_FINAL.pdf It’s all available to you. What you call ‘safeguards’ are about removing the priority to the living breathing mother and placing it on the fetus. This is unacceptable. This places a risk to the mother, if clinicians have to assess their treatment against legislation before assisting their patient. It also means that if there is a change in the woman’s life, she is not free to control her body. It would be forced incubation. Why are you so desperate to control women’s bodies?
25. "*Nothing has been misrepresented except your claim that the state's debt is fractional to what it really is*." Its directly from the most credible source if you dislike that, I can't help you there unfortunately as Its data directly from QLD treasury and published by the Audit office. "*That literally says net debt is forecast to increase due to decreased resources royalties & infrastructure projects.*" Sounds like a simple fix then, Start increasing royalties on Mining and Gas extraction, Its not like they are going to leave as We have the resources they want.
26. Except they're rarely done by courts because of the conditions and definitely NOT for rape - As they are reserved for minor offences or non-violent offences. A rape may be considered by the court to be 'non-violent' in certain situations, but it is *never* a minor offence. Rape is a crime that *must* go to court. Simple as that. It's not a minor offence. It's an indictable offence. You can't just be charged by Police with an indictable offence and then cautioned by Police. It does not happen for rape. An accusation of rape *must* be investigated by Police and then if Police find enough evidence to charge the accused then it *must* go to court. If Police do not find enough evidence to support a charge, then they would not issue a caution. Because the youth would have to accept the caution and if there is no evidence to support a charge... then why would they admit to the offence (Which is required for a Police caution for youth). A caution is *not* an option for a serious indictable offence such as rape. Even if it's just a 'consent issue'. You don't know what you're talking about. Then you even tried to shift the goal posts to hide that, and were still incorrect. Edit: I am still waiting for you to cite the cases where this occurred. You said it happens with a definite 100%, so you must know *one* at the very least. I've tried searching for one and no luck so far.
27. People have the right to express their views, they don’t however have the right for their views to become government policy and they certainly don’t have the right to riot when the people they didn’t vote for win a free and fair election and implement their policy platform. I’m sure you didn’t need me to explain that to you like a preschooler either.
28. if I don't need something then it is by definition a waste of money. do you hear yourself?
29. Well our new premier and his deputy voted in 2018 that abortion should be part of the criminal code. So good chance that one
30. What children are you referring to that are ‘born live and left to die’? Are you referring to the minuscule number of infants born who are unable to survive? Doctors can’t wave a wand and make sure every infant lives.
31. The majority is not all. I'm glad you admit that not all of them are done on non healthy, non viable pregnancies, as I said, and you said the opposite. So it is established that late term abortions of healthy and viable pregnancies are taking place. If you are OK with late term abortions of healthy viable pregnancies, then just say it, don't keep lying that they don't happen.
32. You misunderstand, and perhaps I haven’t adequately explained my position. Police take a complaint (for example, rape), they investigate, and they decide if there’s enough evidence to proceed with the charge. When dealing with child offenders, police have the option to issue a police caution instead of initiating court proceedings. There are many factors to consider when police issue a caution, and amongst them (as you said) the caution must be accepted by the child offender, and the child offender must make admission to the crime (or at least not deny it). If the child offender accepts the caution, it is given by the police, and the matter does not go to court. Police caution is not specific to rape, but can be given for all offences committed by a child offender except attempted murder and murder (as stated by OP). I cannot cite cases because these matters do not go to court, thus there is no public case available for you to look up. Source (since you are hellbent that I don’t know what I’m talking about): am a police officer, worked in Child Investigation and Protection Unit, and am currently a police prosecutor. ETA: I should clarify that for police to issue a caution for rape, there needs to be appropriate authorisation given by higher-ups. The investigating officer doesn’t just decide willynilly to caution for a rape.
33. You have an extreme way of completely missing the point. People absolutely have the right to be heard. The government is meant to represent the people and it increasingly is representing it's own business interests. How else are the people supposed to hold their elected officials accountable when they're in government screwing the people over for years at a time backed by murdoch media? The people have a right to protest. If it comes to it, they have a right to protest - the French certainly had a right to riot. I'm not going to write you a 100 page thesis on the the acceptable times to riot, but it's not over 50 cent fares going up, so keep your hair on. You seem to want to be reductionist to the brink of absurdity. You're not trying to put an ounce of thought into what I might be saying here, and as I said, because this is reddit and not academia, I'm not going to spell it out for you, this isn't my dissertation. If you can't stretch your imagination beyond what seems to be some minor backyard issue and extrapolate it to wider more important issues then meh.
34. You. Are not. The entirety of the state. And your rant screams of “I don’t understand these functions or the people who do them so slash slash slash”
35. I'm referring to this is a nothing protest by useful idiots. If it was a protest foe what you say, then go for it, but don't sully the pond with claims someone is trying to "stop" something when it's waaaay more nuanced.
36. Your phrase ‘late term abortion* of healthy viable pregnancies’ allows no room for consideration of the health of the mother. They’re living humans, not rocks, to use your words. So again, why are you so desperate to control women’s bodies? *not a real medical term
37. I understand. I'm telling you that you're wrong. Youth who are issued a caution have to admit to the crime in order to receive the caution (That's kind of the whole deal... it has to be accepted). If a child admits to rape, they don't get cautioned, they get formally charged. You can't compel or coerce someone to admit to a crime... that's really illegal! They don't go "Look, if you admit to the rape... we'll caution you." <--- That's illegal... extremely so. The youth has to admit to the crime during the investigation, and then they can offer a caution... which they can't do for rape as it is an indictable offence. Cautions can not be given for indictable offences. The fact you think Police are coercing confessions out of children and giving them cautions for serious indictable offences is absurd. Rapists, especially youth rapists, are not typically a 'one and done'. A child who commits rape is not typically an innocent little sunflower, any court case (for any crime) would include that they've been cautioned for rape... which makes it searchable. So far, can't find any! Edit: Holy shit. Skipped the part where you claim you're a Police officer and just saw it now. Are you seriously admitting that you're a Police Officer who engages in coercion? Also, apparently a Police Prosecutor who knows jack shit.
38. The people have been heard. And they overwhelmingly voted for the LNP. In your utopia the only people who deserve to be heard are the ones that agree with you. Otherwise it’s ok to riot. And you’re getting upvoted for it. Yep, cause that’s the modern democracy that we want, bunch of childish brats who have a tantrum when they don’t get their own way.
39. You brought up the ‘right to riot’ not me. So without writing a 100 page thesis, what are some issues you think the people of Qld would be within their rights to riot about?
40. I understand the public service all too well. I am literally a shadow ministerial staffer in the relevant portfolio. it is my entire job to ask pointed questions of the government about the public service, and uncover public service waste. holy shit please stop talking
41. Because abortion is healthcare and if you don’t know that maybe you need to learn a bit more to better inform yourself? If doctors have to question the legality of their healthcare procedures due to laws shifting the priority from the living humans to the fetus, it creates additional risks to both mother and child.
42. It's defined as 22+1. >healthy viable pregnancies’ allows no room for consideration of the health of the mother That is what healthy pregnancy means. The opposite is where the mother is at abnormal risk of severe morbidity or mortality were the pregnancy to continue. You have to obfuscate because you can't admit that aborting healthy and viable pregnancies is wrong, but you also won't outright say you support it. It's got nothing to do with controlling women's bodies. If they would birth the child alive and give it up for adoption instead of killing it, then it wouldn't make any difference to them. There is minimal procedural difference between late term abortions and childbirth, other than the intent behind them.
43. Just to clarify, are you telling a Police Prosecutor that they are dead wrong in relation to what can and can't be cautioned by Police?
44. It appears that you have your mind made up and you don’t/won’t/can’t understand what I’ve explained to you numerous times. I don’t know any other way that I can enlighten you on this topic, so I think it’s best to leave things here. All the best on your educational journey about the Qld Justice System, specifically in relation to crimes committed by youths.
45. Firstly that vote was far from overwhelming. Secondly, that's not what I'm saying. Those are not the words i wrote, is your brain broken? Why are you assigning me a narrative that I didn't say? You all need to stop cherry picking a single word out of my entire comment to try to make an inflammatory point, it's an invalid way to make an argument.
46. Your obsession with rioting when that's not the point of anything exposes that you don't comment in good faith. I'm done being goaded into continually talking about rioting like it's a word in your spank bank. Ground level. Community action comes first, protests next etc. Why are you obsessed with an extreme action that hopefully never happens? Do you work for Sky News? I've responded to you too many times already, but this is the last.
47. Sorry whose staffer are u/NeverSharted? Basically what I’m hearing is that your taxpayer funded job is perfectly fine… even though you’re spending your day on Reddit. But you know exactly where to slash other people’s jobs. Sounds like you represent exactly who I voted against and exactly why I want you and your minister as far away from power as possible.
48. So why not just say abortion? Are you ashamed deep down, or do you recognise that most people aren't informed on how bad the laws are and if they looked into them they would be rightfully outraged by the sheer barbarism that has been allowed in their name? Did the doctors performing medically necessary late term terminations of pregnancy often run into legal issues before the laws changed, or are you full of shit? The foetus is a living human lol, what do you think it is, a rock?
49. Is it now? Can you provide a medical source for that definition please? Given that the overwhelming existing reason for what you’re calling ‘late term abortion’ is for the health of the mother, if you support abortion as healthcare for a mother at risk, why are arguing against late term abortion? I don’t believe that healthy and rational women are flippantly terminating perfectly healthy and viable fetuses the way you are suggesting.
50. Yes. I am. You claimed that youth committing rape are being cautioned by Police. I am telling you that you are wrong. I have oodles of case studies, case notes, judgments, and legislation etc to confirm you are wrong. You have... a stupid claim that it's happening of which you can not provide proof. Also a Police prosecutor doesn't make you special. As a 2nd year law student I already know more than you.
