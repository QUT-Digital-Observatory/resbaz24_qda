Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. How about they have ignored the regions long enough with their city centric and condescending views. They are buying their votes with 50c public transport and free school lunches which wastes valuable dollars which could be better spent in a targeted fashion to really help those truly in need, not handouts for all and sundry. All with borrowed money mind you. They have allowed dozens of regional health services to go into bypass with few returning from bypass. More contempt for the regions. Their net zero energy plans that are so very expensive and will not give us energy security into the future. They are wreaking the environment to supposedly save the environment. Even after the majority of the state said NO to the vice referendum, the arrogance of the ALP said, yeah na, we know best, people are dumb and plunged forward regardless of the views held by the MAJORITY with their treaty and truth telling process. This is the height of their arrogance and contempt for the views of the Qld people. These clowns have to go.
2. Imo, the katter party just needs a little push from someone with a bit more resources in the region. The wagner family comes to mind. Just like how simon holmes gave the teals just that little push to give a viable option for voters. All katter really needs to do is campaign on the fact that the katter party is the true spiritual successor to the nats.
3. Socialist I guess in that they don't want to blow up the government into smithereens and like government services. They're basically if you resurrected the labour party of the 70s into 2024. Hell they expelled a former One Nation member from the party for being racist. They may as well be Rural Teals. This fucked the LNP because the KAP electorates have a mandate to ban abortion but the LNP seats really don't. I don't see KAP coalitioning with the LNP just reading the policies they stand for either. Abortion is all they have in common.
4. Well, if a farm is family owned and operated, then the workers own the means of production ;P
5. I’d argue that a week is enough time to accomodate for the majority of that subset. A fortnight is a long time in an election campaign, and as we’ve seen over the past two weeks, some potentially influential insights have been uncovered.
6. You're delusional if you think LNP give a fuck about regional hospitals. Lol.
7. Yeah right, very interesting party. I honestly didn't know much about them until now.
8. Yeah nah. Walmart and ikea are family owned, I'm pretty sure the workers don't own the means of production
9. Pretty sure the islanders working our paddocks don't own em.
10. It's not in the inner/outer metropolitan area but Sportsbet has Labor at $5.00 for Townsville. It's been a Labor stronghold since 1989 (except that one wipe out in 2012). In this time frame, they've generally taken out ALP/Liberal by a decent margin (i.e. not by the skin of their teeth). [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral\_results\_for\_the\_district\_of\_Townsville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_results_for_the_district_of_Townsville) This comeback in Labor's popularity may have been enough to secure a majority. I'd figure out why Sportsbet prefers LNP for Townsville and if it's worth dropping money on Labor. Edit: I'm speculating Sportsbets preference for LNP is because Labor was wiped out in 2012, got back by the skin of their teeth in 2017, held onto the seat relatively comfortably in 2020 only to have Crisafulli scare people's mums over a zoomer uprising. I'd check out Townsvilles demographics to see if they'd be to kind of people who would resonate more strongly with ALP (e.g. 18-49 year olds according to the YouGov poll). If you're able to sexually reproduce and you happen to be in Townsville, chances are you care more about abortion than some manlets A Clockwork Orange fanfic.
11. I've actually read a bit more of them, and part of their policies is also renationalising privatised government assets but also hates woke and wants to ban trans people from sports. Bob Katter himself was part of the Labour party until 1957 and is still a proud CFMEU member. Honestly it's politics that like aren't contradictory but it's like if you mixed American Republicans with the greens and this is what you get.
12. That's what the "operated" part is there for ;P Like I said to the other person, it would probably only be practical on the hobby farm scale. Nothing too serious
13. Depends on what you count as operated then haha If I own a truck and pay someone to operate it, I probably wouldn't call myself an owner operator of the truck. Maybe I should have used "fully owned and operated" instead? It would probably only work for real small farms anyway, kinda on the scale of hobby farms
14. > I'd figure out why Sportsbet prefers LNP for Townsville and if it's worth dropping money on Labor. Could be because Townsville is basically the epicentre of the "youth crime" wave that the LNP are crying about, so if there was anywhere that message would resonate with voters more than the rest of the state, it'd be the Townsville electorates (Townsville, Mundingburra, Thuringowa, Hinchinbrook).
15. > Bob Katter himself was part of the Labour party until 1957 and is still a proud CFMEU member. He also used to be part of the Nationals *before* they were just a bog standard conservative party and actually the party of the bush and farmers. He's basically the last relic of that era.
16. But operating isn't owning the means of production...it's just working. >it would probably only be practical on the hobby farm scale. Nothing too serious That's bullshit. You create collectives. It's what brought the USSR out of the peasantry and has kept Cuba alive through the sanctions.
17. Good observation, Townsville had the most youth offender arrests from Taskforce Guardian deployments (7 May 2023 – 7 May 2024). [https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/townsville/2024/05/23/1200-charged-as-taskforce-guardian-marks-one-year-tackling-youth-crime/](https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/townsville/2024/05/23/1200-charged-as-taskforce-guardian-marks-one-year-tackling-youth-crime/) Cursory glance at Reddit shows users living in Townsville at the time had witnessed far more youth crime than they had experienced in the past. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Townsville/comments/177i2jz/are\_we\_really\_in\_the\_midst\_of\_a\_youth\_crime\_wave/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Townsville/comments/177i2jz/are_we_really_in_the_midst_of_a_youth_crime_wave/) Campaigning on youth crime could be enough to sway Townsville.
18. Right, but I said "family owned and operated", as in the family owns the farm and also operates the farm. (I also meant exclusively owns and operates it entirely by themselves, but my joke didn't really make that clear.) So, the workers (the family working the farm) owned the means of production (the farm itself). It was supposed to be a dumb joke, but I don't think I made it clear enough. Sorry about that. I'm also aware that farming collectives exist and have had a pretty significant role to play in the wider agricultural system around the world. My joke was supposed to be about how the KAP could be considered socialist. I figured there would be more family owned and operated farms in Queensland than farming collectives. In hindsight, I think there's a couple of dairy collectives that I could have tried to go with, but I'm not sure about the KAP's stance on dairy farming specifically. I imagine they're supportive of it, though only because I get the feeling that KAP is pro farmers in general. Plus, I think talking about owner-operator farms is a bit clearer of a premise for a joke, given KAP's support for farmers. (I'm pretty sure there aren't any KAP candidates around my area, so I haven't really looked into their policies. Most of my information about them comes through seeing how they're discussed online.) All that said, my joke clearly didn't work. Sorry about that, I'll have to try make it clearer next time. Also sorry this is a wall of text, I'm too tired to edit it down to make it snappier
19. I have no evidence of this but my (somewhat educated) guess is it’s funded by coal/mining interests
20. People who think that even though they have benefited the most from our society and system, they shouldn’t be asked to contribute to said society. When they talk prosperity they mean theirs and theirs alone, if you’re poor there’s clearly something wrong with you so it’s economic Darwinism ….
21. Doesn't look like they stand for anything. "Australians should be prosperous." What a grand idea? Any idea how?
22. Americanised politics with donations running the agenda almost. Nothing sus about it. Just more american culture.
23. Australians for Prosperity (A4P) is simply a LNP media front Executive Director of AustraliansforProsperity is Julian Simmonds, who used to be the LNP incumbent for Walter-Taylor Ward (Brisbane Council) and also the Division of Ryan (Federal). I lived in his electorate when I was studying and remember his face on election boards. Advisory Board member Alexandra 'Alex' Sinenko is current president of the Young LNP https://www.ylnp.org/our-team Advisory Board member Darcy Creighton is the Federal President for the Young Liberals Movement, and an ex-staffer for Peter Dutton. https://www.youngliberal.org.au/team https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/qld-liberal-clubs-campus-war-sparks-legal-action/news-story/522279fe0a0ceb4c91b815ab8db056dd
24. Given that the Executive Director is a former LNP federal member, it’s almost certainly guaranteed.
25. Also worth noting they’ve donated nearly $500,000 to the LNP campaign.
26. No, more likely someone who's actually worse then the LNP.
27. The ‘I got Mine.’ Mentality. Also, sounds a lot like Christian Prosperity Theology. Wealth = Righteousness. Poverty and Disability = Unrighteous Sinner!
28. Get up actually does some tangible work compared to the divisive religious nonsense that Advance Australia does.
29. Technically a boomer (and male) and there’s no chance I’ll be voting for a political party that doesn’t support women’s reproductive rights.
30. Don’t envy you. It’s really Handmaids take territory. Melbourne will welcome you x
31. We just have to ensure this doesn’t happen quietly. Protesting is dangerous in this country, but god damn I am starting to not care. If this wankfest of a cuntparty wins the election, we’ll have to get loud.
32. Older guy here! I’ll never give the LNP my vote again. They are just another hate based party that just licks the boot of the mining companies.
33. It's all I could think about for the last 2 weeks. My partner and I were hoping to start our family in the next 4 years now there's no way we will if we have insecure healthcare. My friend from WA where abortion is not legal almost died from sepsis from a much wanted pregnancy and would have left two babies behind.
34. Abortion doesn't affect me, drug laws don't affect me, but I'll be fucked if I ever vote for these christo-fascists and their regressive, 18th century bullshit. You have my support as a fellow human being.
35. As a husband and father to a daughter, my vote was easy... Labour all day long. Everyone had a mother, that alone should be enough to never try to control Women's rights... Yet here we are. I too have been all over US politics for years now, and it's scary AF. The LNP is now Australia's GQP and they're a danger to our nation. Anyone voting LNP needs to wake TF up.
36. Honestly I'm truly hoping lnp get destroyed again, Murdoch media is really pushing for them though
37. Yes I’m shocked and disappointed, wtaf happened? I’m hoping the public opinion is turning and the LNP are no longer a favourite to win
38. There's all sorts of horrible shit cropping up in this election. There's one small party campaigning for bringing back the legal right to "physically discipline" your kids because they think it will solve youth crime (SO many issues there I could write a dissertation). And one party (family first) is terribly transphobic. Then there are abortion rights and women body automony. Wtf is happening and why are we as a society, deciding to just ignore science and psychology?
39. I’m feeling anxious too. It’s not just the potential removal of women’s rights, but also a general lack of empathy that we know will harm our most vulnerable in society. It truly saddens me. Hope you find some trains to be hopeful and less anxious OP, even if it’s just in seeing supportive comment here x
40. As a gay man who moved here from the US, I’m considering moving to Victoria if things become too uncomfortable. Women deserve better. I’m not dealing conservative bs taking away civil rights. I lived too much of my life in fear.
41. Health Care lays in the hands of the wealthy. People who have private health, and will never use the public system. To them, we are just freeloaders. And you'll find a scary amount of anti-abortion supporters are married women, and older women whom can't have children anymore. A shitload of migrant families as well seem to vote Liberal too which is nuts but given we get most our migrants from very religious parts of the world it's not surprising. This whole thing is just a religious/class election.
42. Holy hell, a lot of LNP supporters here calling the kettle black. As if scare campaigns are anything new, the entirety of the LNP platform for the last twenty years has almost always involved scare campaigns, and now you fucking complain?
43. Actually a woman has been one the most vocal in support of criminalizing abortion rights. And she's a fucking fruit loop too and it's getting to the point of becoming pure hate and harassment. Basically started a club she called the 'baby killers club' and slanders/bullies random people through it... Even worse, she's head of a university department 🤦
44. I’m a boomer and the Womens Lib movement didnt fight for this shit, for it to be taken away by male boomers. Next they’ll ban women having their own bank accounts like the “good ole days”
45. The reason why we got here is because a large majority of voters will vote LNP without fully understanding what Crisafulli is about, what is at stake, and what the LNP will do to Qld. It's mind blowing how well Miles has down for Qld in the short period of time he's been premier. Imagine what can be accomplished with another 4 years. Yet here we are, willing to throw it all away, with the help of Murdoch media of course
46. As a middle aged man it completely baffles me why men and boomers (and god botherers of any persuasion) think it is their issue to decide on as well.
47. I’m running as a candidate and support you 100%. I’m on the booths 10 hours a day, fighting for a LNP loss.
48. If a party that supports stripping women of their bodily autonomy and rights gets voted into power, that’ll be the last straw for me and I will have lost ALL faith in Aus. The golden days of Aus being a great place to live are long behind us at this point.
49. This will absolutely be pushed through to the delight of a very small handful of hard line Christians supported vocally by the likes of Sky News and Courier Mail.
50. Speak to your dad, your brothers, uncles etc. Let them know it's just not ok for a man to decide what a woman does with their body. Tell them you get to chop their balls off if you decided "just because, ya know God told me" -signed, a man.
51. If in Gold Coast or Brisbane, let me know, I can give you some corflutes to put up. Get in contact with your local Labor MP/Candidate and volunteer. Ringing and wasting the time of LNP phone numbers is also good. Have as many conversations with people on why to vote labor. Or, be like an NZ woman who threw a dildo at the right wing prime minister. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waitangi\_dildo\_incident)
52. Honestly as a woman 46f I feel like if the LNP win again it’s because we’ve been let down by other women. Any woman who votes along “conservative” lines is a traitor to all other women. I’m absolutely appalled seeing women in my community jumping on the patriarchal bandwagon and “slutshaming” women and young girls who need reproductive care. In my own experience I’ve never needed an abortion but my sister required 2 in between her two children as her life was at risk with both *wanted* pregnancies. If she’d not been able to access those she’d have probably died leaving her husband a widow and single dad. Her daughter would have been motherless and my nephew never born. Screw these women voting for LNP or any anti woman group including One Nation
53. The how did we get here. Is answered in your next sentence. The LNP take all their policies from the US Republican Party. They're basically an extension of that party. Essentially working for a foreign power against the core values of Australia. The people who vote for them. A vast majority of them are conservative nutjobs. Who'd love to see Australia as the 51st State of America.
54. I'm 50, a mother, grandmother, worker, renter. All I can say is have faith. I say to every person my age and older that "I will be voting Labor. They are trying to better Queensland. You might not see it, but you have had your time. My parents held the balance of power since their generation came of age. Since 1967 onwards, and they had a hell of a good life. BUT it's 2024, and I am voting for my children and grandchild. They need things to change for the better. If things go backwards, ala LNP, then Australia won't be great. You won't be here, you will probably be dead, but you should care for the next generations. Stop votingagainsttheir interests by voting for your interests. You have had about 60 years of power, give it a rest" Also, I'm glad to hear that you care. Of my six kids, all voting age, only two will enrol to vote. Have faith young one.
55. I'm not huge into politics but this scares me just as much and this specific reason is why I will not be voting for LNP in the foreseeable future. Forcing women to have unwanted children will contribute more to the youth crime situation we're currently experiencing, in the future, so their whole "adult crime, adult time" bullshit is counter-intuitive. Women's reproductive choices aren't a fkn political decision. End of story. Miles seems to be doing an okay job anyway tbh
56. He is not only a weirdo, he is a liar. He will jail women for abortions.
57. Boomer here, men should have no say over a woman's body or the fetus within, not even the father, as they only provided the semen.
58. I think we should ignore polling from now on. I think Miles will win.
59. I'm incredibly anxious. Two of my friends are running in my electorate. One is the current MP and the other is for the LNP. I know my LNP friend doesn't believe in abortion whatsoever and we've had many conversations about it over the years. They recently came out and said "Yes women shook have that option but I don't believe in it personally." Which is an absolute backflip on his position and he's only doing it for popularity. He has never believed in abortion for anyone. Including incest or sexual assault. I specifically asked him these questions over the years. Including just after I had been sexually assaulted (he didn't know that I had been).
60. Right there with you on this issue. look after yourself.
61. This is the effects of patriarchy...the whole system is like this, though improving slowly with time.
62. Not Australian, so by definition I have no say in this. My perception is that it’s often a golden ratio of personal beliefs (for instance, but not limited to, religion), and lack of insight (such as education) leading to these opinions. Not to say that you are not entitled to those opinions, but they ability to actually force those same beliefs (which might actually harm the population, in ways they cannot comprehend due to said beliefs) onto the population is scary. I think this is a thing in most countries. My impression of the general politician is steadily declining on a daily basis. Not to say that I endorse technocracy, but it would maybe benefit everyone if politicians are required some sort of education/experience in fields other that pure policy and soft skills.
63. One of the most ironical things from this is the hate old people have for the young. Old guy happily commenting that he is fine with kids being locked up. By his own admission, he has committed theft over decades, drug trafficking and insurance fraud. Always name dropping Sydney crims from his day. He never got caught or convicted but fine with kids being locked up. It’s a mental illness in old age that you have hate children.
64. After the drift towards US style Christian nationalism from the LNP over the last 10 years I can confidently say they won't get my vote ever again.
65. I was intending to vote Liberal until they brought abortion onto the table. I think they may have fucked themselves with this.
66. Contingency plan: if the LNP squeak in, you’ll have a list of people who vote a certain way and those assholes get sent or hand delivered a coat hanger. Not going to let this down without a fight. I voted 1 and 2 for progressives and had the worst time ordering the last three nuggets. This will have a swing, if it’s enough to change the outcome we’ll see
67. Campaign. Volunteer. Tell your friends and family. Hand out how to vote cards. If enough people feel like you and me, the religious rights will get their arses handed to them on a platter by the voters. Even if they win, a slim majority ensures that the most radical changes won’t pass.
68. As a female, it's scary out there. I am so disgusted that the election has turned into this??? Shouldn't we be focusing on the fact that no one can afford to live at the moment. Leave our bodies alone, WTF.
69. Back in the 80s when I was young, abortion was a criminal offence in Queensland - so it's my generation that is largely responsible for decriminalisation. The majority of boomer women support bodily autonomy. The only real opposition is the religious right.
70. The recent trumpian style abortion related campaigns are all down to Australia's current leading anti-choice activist University of Adelaide Law Professor Joanna Howe and her "Dr Joanna Howe" platform. She started spreading disinformation on healthcare and international human rights law via her social media from mid-2022 and was behind Katter's QLD 'Babies Born Alive' Bill, Antic/Canavan's Federal 'Babies Born Alive' Bill and SA's 'Forced Birth' Bill. Prof. Joanna Howe openly aims to make abortion in Australia "*unthinkable*" mainly using her platform to aggressively target anyone that questions her misrepresented sources, data and outright lies solely because of her position as a law professor (specialising in labour migration) allegedly making her claims unquestionable. Howe has been emboldened by her long-term support from the Australian Christian Lobby and Women's Forum Australia and for whatever reason the University of Adelaide (where she is a new-ish professor of law) do not care about the damage she is doing to their reputation. Howe has significant funds and connections already as she is close with The Advertiser editor Gemma Jones and editor of The Australian who publish whatever BS she wants them to. [Here's a fact-check of her claims](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10cJfeDBIAYVZklthAT2blcZvcrXsP7lg/view) and [here is my TikTok](http://www.tiktok.com/@prgygrgy) where I respond to some of her posts.
71. I voted labor...fk cristafullifuckhead. Body autonomy should not be a political decision, ever
72. I would never vote for a right wing religious muppet who denies women the right to decide on her body. And wants to take away VAD laws😡
73. Not going into a big rant but seriously I feel like there are so many issues that are not the governments problem or they should just literally not make it their business. Abortion, is nobodies business but the person it involves. It's their future that is impacted and their choice to be a mother. They can do with their body what they like. I know it's a stretch but I'm really sick of governments still being so anti drugs. We let people buy cigarettes and kill themsleves slowly, give themselves cancer. We let people drink and theres a whole host of issues that come with that. Both of these are taxed and legal. Why are we not easing the burden on police and legalising other drugs or allowing people to do what they want with their own bodies? Surely having legal options or safer options on the street would elimate a whole host of illegal and unsafe options out there. You make abortions illegal and people will turn to unsafer and illegal options, you will not stop it. The government for a country like us which has developed quite quickly over the last 100 years, is far too slow with updating how things are run and what is ok and what is not.
74. I genuinely used to admire Musk. His poor business decisions, coupled with voluntarily becoming Trumps b*itch, exposed him for the lonely loser he's always been. Such a shame!
75. Hear you mate. As a single middle aged male (fuck me, where did the time go) with no kids and some assets, you and any women has my full support to self determine your own reproductive rights. Sad to see we are back to a choice between moving forward and a choice to go back to the bad days of backyard abortions, zero harm minimisation and a “let’s just jail the fuck out of everyone and hope they’ll appreciate the years of mental torture when they get out”.
