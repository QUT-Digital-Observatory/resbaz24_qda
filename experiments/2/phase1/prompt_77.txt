Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. I'm the same! They're def last on the card this year. And I had a phone call last night, recorded message from that clown and now a text this morning. Why are you obsessed with me David? How are they allowed to spam us, but others have unsubscribe or stop in their messages?
2. Shame they used up all the candidates less than favourable pasts leading into the election, as these kinds of things can result in by-elections and a minority government in jeopardy of being not able to pass any laws. They will want to go the whole term and avoid an early election so there backers have enough time to cash in on there investment.
3. Community? Selfish scumbags have been convincing everyone how great it is to be a selfish scumbag. They won't prevail, but it's a never ending battle.
4. Why the fuck have we mote introduced proper laws to mandate truthfulness in political advertising?! As you said, they've made obviously incorrect assertions about crime rates that can be googled in 5 seconds but nothing is done to stop them running these ads?!
5. Every time I hear "they've been in too long" I just can't help but think, 'what? so you want an unstable government?' like why?
6. Perfect answer. LNP are shit and offer nothing but will take everything
7. They don’t mine coal at mt isa but I take your point. I have spent over 8 years living in but fuck no where qld and it really didn’t matter who you vote for, nothing good comes out that way even though most of the qld budget dollars come from out there. It’s all just scare campaigns as they have nothing positive to offer. I also think in qld that the LNP are much more national biased than other states or federal and that’s where we are getting the Americanism stuff from. Now living in the city I can see and feel benefits from the Labour Party policies and I’ll be damned if I’m going to give my vote to someone who will do nothing for us just like the regional areas get.
8. We do this on a cycle and it’s mystifying. We have a long running ALP government, which at times grows complacent. We vote in the LNP who promise to “fix the rot”. They fuck things up. Then we remember that they’re shit and vote in the ALP for another prolonged stint. Can we just skip it this time and keep Labor?
9. I mean, ESPECIALLY in QLD. We -know- what happens every time a LNP government gets in, and half the current bunch of dickheads have publicly spoken about their links to JBP. Why is anybody shocked when they fuck the state up?
10. I've always been told both parties are shit but what's getting to me is that people themselves are voting for someone that actively screws them over in the long run and that's what I'm trying to understand. What is it that makes the average person that doesn't own a business or multiple investments vote for said piece of shit. I think I'll be going down that route soon and just vote for any independent at the time that has anything remotely close to what I like and the big 4 last and just ignore the rest until next election
11. Libs ain’t done shit since before Howard. They are so bad for the economy and everything else in australia that voting for them is voting against yourself
12. That's the other thing that fucking pisses me off is that a bunch of old males get to choose what a woman can and can't do as if they know what it's like.
13. A very honest answer. Outside of SEQ things are different.
14. From my shitty memory lnp don't help with that kind of issue they just make it worse, aren't they the ones that like to slash anything to do with healthcare, the words he's spewing now are worthless because it's election time, what have lnp done that is better then what Labor has done? I'm actually asking here not trying to be an ass or do you mean they are that desperate they don't care about the past and just think shoet term as in the current government haven't done anything for them atm?
15. that is just standard LNP playbook isnt it? agree re labour, i'm not bound to any party, but LNP is very clearly the worst of the lot unless you own a coal mine.
16. You forgot dodging question and just repating that's not in the plan lol
17. >Surely he'd have done something ok by accident even? This gave me a good chuckle.
18. Best, most balanced response in this thread. 90% of voters who always vote one way do because of identity. And changing their mind is not an option for the majority.
19. Hey, and maybe, if we put "food" on these "youth criminals" tables they won't feel the need to commit "crimes" Or we could just keep beating them down........ that's proven to work /s
20. Or first home buyers being locked out of the market by greedy politicians buying up investment properties, especially those of a particular stripe.
21. Agreed, their "policies" are mostly just dog whistles for their conservative base, but lack any real substance.
22. I'm sorry but I feel you're wrong on both counts, I've actually gotten a few really good replies if you wanna read through (they're the paragraph ones) as for their website there's no fucking way I'm reading that shit, the fact you even said yourself they're light on the detail on their own plan says it all, I imagine it's more bs like the flyers they're dropping everywhere plus they won't give me the downside to what they're doing like others that are more informed on the subject then me and I feel it'll be designed like that for a reason considering they didn't want to spill the beans on anything until the last bloody second
23. It feels like this whole youth crime crisis stuff came completely out of nowhere I literally never heard of it (outside of some older people insisting that cities are unsafe in Australia now) until about a month ago
24. Good 'Ole "Fuck you I got mine" boomer mindset. Seriously, there is a generation that couldn't die off quick enough.
25. I'll take things that didn't happen for $400, please Ken.
26. Yeah half the reason there's so many consultants in the public service is because of the huge cuts during the Newman govt. There's only a few ways to reduce the number of consultants: provide fewer government services, hire more public servants, part public servants more so that they stay in the public service. I know I definitely don't want fewer services and I highly doubt an LNP government will hire more full time employees or even pay the ones that are there more so I'm very sceptical of their claims.
27. Also people below made some great points about Crissafullasht. Sorry The graph on funding is a great visual aid. Lnp generally wants to take funding out of social programs that experts in related fields support, usually because they take a burden off the medical system and keep people alive. Lnp are also against climate change action, green energy and sustainable future. Also against immigration, which is always funny(sad) for a colonised country. Picture this - deliberately making the oceans rise, destroying the Pacific Islands, having a huge influx of climate refugees who are referred to by lnp as Australia's fruit pickers in a derogatory sense, because elitist and racist, and then having no programs to prevent suicide. But the rich n well off will have no problems, because they'll have so much money, which inherently solves problems right? Monopolies definitely don't create problems. Lnp also usually tried to gut the education system as well, make curriculum that don't create well balanced young people, but desperate ignorant workaholics living in cycles of perpetual fear of losing what little they have, so much so that they don't have the time or ability to learn about what is being done to them. And subsequently will raise generations of people who will accept crumbs, of crumbs, of crumbs. I'm saying revolt yeah, but learning about lnp policy from the abc or the guardian or like, anyone but the lnp will be the quickest way to understanding what they're about. And to prove it to yourself, read abc, then lnp. Compare the 2 🔶️ Sorry again big rant 👁👄👁
28. Make your way to the courier mail FB page then 🤷
29. Or, and hear me out here…. One of these “sports teams” is objectively a good and forward thinking governmental candidate that is batting for the home team, and the other is a dodgy corrupt self serving con job of a government that is openly and objectively planning in drive QLD back 20 years and has a leader and team with a track recorded of documented corruption and hasn’t told a single truth or been open with their plan, hiding behind nudge nudge wink wink bullshit. Maybe, just maybe, it’s not an echo chamber, but your sports team is wrong.
30. Unless LNP win...then I want a recount or another election immediately
31. I have only had calls and SMS from the LNP, shows they are in desperation mode if they need to do this.
32. Genuine question - do you know how much the royalties bring in? And do you know how much Labor has already spent in promises? Just to get clued in, the money has already been spent 3 times over and we are well into heavy borrowing territory now with more and more "free" promises being made. S&P have pointedly said that if this sort of thing continues and we don't reign it in, we're going to lose our AA+ rating which would be terrible for our economy. I don't want to sound like an old boomer, but Labor are definitely not "fiscally responsible" - they are gambling here. I don't think LNP are better either, but let's stop shrugging our shoulders and saying that mining royalties are a limitless money tree.
33. Labor wins in spite of Qld being a 1 newspaper state. Labor wins and the Murdoch papers and media is rigged. You think you've said something but you haven't. Your post up until that point was quite good and I agree.
34. You mustn't have read the news lately to think there isn't any media bias
35. I don't think this is true. You will hear some pro-LNP and anti-Labor opinions, but they will be so relentlessly downvoted that you should expect to scroll a long way to go find them.
36. You're absolutely right, but that won't stop the Reddit hivemind downvoting you. The complete unwillingness to genuinely have a debate - and this disingenuous thread is not welcoming a genuine debate - is exactly why this sub is such an echo chamber. It's simply not worth trying. I'm not even an LNP voter, but it's incredibly frustrating seeing people lamenting how much the non-ALP parties lie, and in the same breath spreading misinformation themselves. Smashing downvote on anything that isn't pro-ALP based on the headline and blaming Newman for everything that's ever gone wrong (despite 27 of the past 33 years being Labor governance) is the r/brisbane playbook. Come Saturday night, it'll be a meltdown in here.
37. Yes, it pisses off the media moguls when they can't fully control an election outcome. You honestly think the media has a pro Labor bias?
38. All 'youth crime' policies have been widely panned universally by experts who work in the field, and the idea of a crisis is almost entirely made up. Their policies, at best, will be utterly ineffective, and it's much more likely to make things worse. The 'conscience vote' is the path they will use to try and wind back abortion laws, as KAP has already confirmed they will bring one forward. No matter what noise Crisafulli makes about there being 'no change' it's a lie; if he's allowing a conscience vote, the laws will change with a LNP government
39. Mining Royalties, the LNP has committed to a return to private interests being given Queensland owned resources for free depriving the state of an income stream.
40. He supported at the 11th hour didn't he.....The question was always about whether he would allow a conscience vote or not. We have a recent history in how that would go.
41. Not labor supporters. Human beings who have regular human morals. The kind of people who care and have empathy towards the elderly, non white people, the poor and the desperate.
42. Thank you for stating these. I personally still think he's shithouse and there are a few things like the 50c fares, emissions targets and stance on abortion which he's been disingenuous and untruthful on, but thank you for outlining what he's said.
43. Unfortunately you've just wasted your time and effort posting this. There are none so blind as those who will not see - people here will still declare the LNP have proposed "absolutely zero policies" despite your efforts.
44. Aw shucks, you're onto me. Glad you were here to drop your 2 cents in tho and help boost it to the top, thanks champ
45. at what point do you say he's doing a bad job then? since labor controls every state in the country as well as federal government right now. Labor have been in government in Queensland for like 30 years outside of the Newman government over a decade ago. Yet still this shadow of mr burns rupert murdoch pulling the strings looms large over reddit...
46. That's exactly what I'm starting to see is that the mass population seem to like shooting themselves in the foot then bitch about it
47. AGREE >It seems to me that people are having last minute hesitation about Crisafulli and the LNP. Many issues are lacking detail and require more detailed information. the Devil you know or the other Devil we used to know from Campbell Newman days. Then the Devil is in the details. All politicians are going to Hell, they know it so they make self serving decisions
48. I don't know why you are getting downvoted. The Brisbane and Qld subs are massive echo chambers. I thought we all realised this last year after the No vote. And the people who voted No are probably voting LNP. I can't understand how these subs can't get their heads around this. Your average LNP NO voters probably isn't on Reddit. Just like how you're not hanging out with them.
49. This sub is predominantly anti-regressive and anti-conservative. There was plenty of debate around Labor policies prior to the election. The sub has focused on Pro Labor because it wants the LNP defeated for obvious reasons. But it isn't by default, a Pro Labor Sub.
50. Made even worse by the fact that even reasonable posts such as yours are downvoted. So many posts ask why anyone would vote LNP and then real posts end up at the bottom of the pile so the only think people read are crazy counter opinions. How can people think that 50% of the population don't have any reason to vote LNP other than "they are manipulated by the media"?
51. It's the biggest echo chamber ever! All the poeple are saying it!
52. LNP has always caused more debt so to give them credit for anything to do with debt or the economy is pretty insane.
53. Personally I like miles, and labour is my first pick, but good on you for choosing independents. Voting independents is the only way we can make our system less of a two party shithole.
54. Oh don't get me wrong I know they all fucking suck but I know it'll be one of the 2 that will win and lnp seems to be a lot worse. Legalise weed all the way baby haha
55. The absolute state of reddit that this gets you a downvote. The ALP’s shameless pork barrelling is going to mean that a lot of improvements won’t end up getting done in Qld if they get in — the trade off for 50c public transport fares and school lunches for everyone is that there will be less money going around for infrastructure like public transport and health system improvement. The way they have let the union movement dictate construction in the state also means it is more expensive to do business in qld than anywhere else — again meaning fewer building projects and when they happen they’re more expensive. The ABS notes that the number of union stop work days in Qld is 4 times that of Victoria for example, another Labor state. Consider if you will what this means for the ability to build affordable housing, or new road and rail infrastructure. The waste of time and money Labor has put in when it comes to the Olympics has been shameful. There remains enormous risk that if they get another term they would still get nothing done or put in place some terrible solution like a major stadium in place of QE2 where there is no supporting infrastructure. All of these things are things I think the LNP will do better. Having said all that - I wouldn’t trust the Cristifulli as far as I could throw him. While he has said no changes to abortion, it just seems wildly unbelievable to me. He seems to have a policy of do nothing and there is a real risk he is Campbell Newman lite. I will say, despite what you read on here, there has certainly been spikes in house break ins and stolen cars in the last 4 years. The AFR suggested that 46% of people they surveyed have experienced a crime or know someone directly that has in the past year. People on here will dispute there is any spike in this sort of crime but if you look at the stats properly it is clear there has been a rise. There does need to be something done about it and I’m not sure Labor have the ticker to act on it. So that’s where I stand on it. I’ll probably still vote Labor, but for me it’s a case of how can I send a message that Labor needs to reign in unions and pork barrelling, vs not get lumped with Cristifulli creating some sort of dystopian nightmare. A real choice of a shit sandwich or a giant douche
56. Nick Xenophon was the last politician that I genuinely liked, and that I thought actually cared about people.
57. I mean, when it comes to the choices for this election, One Nation or Family First aren't much better than LNP or especially Labour?
58. Dude, no. Family First and One Nation are batshit insane cunts who go last. Do not give them even a preferential vote. When voting, it goes- 1. The ones you actually want 2. Labor 3. LNP 4. Batshit insane cunts If you give batshit insane cunts a vote, it will encourage LNP to adopt their policies.
59. Nah I put them last, but someone needs to be second last
60. It looks like the most likely outcome is an LNP minority government with KAP picking up seats (though that is only slightly ahead of a slim minority LNP government). It looks like the LNP landslide has vanished. Hopefully they dont do too much damage to the state when in power but im not hopeful.
61. Sportsbet are still showing odds 8:1 if Labor wins if you want to throw a few dollars on just in case.
62. Honestly praying for a lnp minority government meaning it’ll be hard af to do any of the draconian shit they want to do.
63. Want to know how? Take a look at the funding coming from the coal industry. It's the same thing that happened when Rudd tried to tax the resources industry. It turns out money can polish a turd. https://preview.redd.it/4h94une07twd1.png?width=1026&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a118a03edd88c9c9a11b5ccfb1a93ce75d9e7be That doesn't even include the funding going to non-party pro-LNP campaigns.
64. Because there's a not insignificant number of people who think after a government has been in a while we should give the other mob a go. Policy doesn't seem to be high on the agenda as they are low information.
65. Someone told me it's about youth crime. That's why they're voting them in.
66. I honestly think people it’s because people blame the effects of a global pandemic on the local government and the lnp is mostly backed by right wing conservatives and boomers who don’t need to worry about rising cost of housing, education, and healthcare. Sadly, they’re often the ones who religiously vote
67. People are completely unengaged and apathetic to the whole process. Hence they vote on core beliefs or values that they think align with one of the teams. It’s a consequence of the complete capitulation of the Labor Party and the trade union movement during the 1970s and 1980s into neoliberalism and class collaboration, the agenda that Bob Hawke and Paul Keating enacted.
68. A lot of people still seem to harbour a lot of anger over the whole Voice referendum and want to punish Labor accordingly. Best way to spite them? Vote for the opposition, even if it means voting against the interests of a large chunk of our population.
69. I think the 2023 referendum did a lot of damage QLD Labor. People don’t forget their local members were shoving it down their throats and Annastacia ballsing up and fucking off when the going got tough.
70. Some of their policies that aren’t being covered in much depth in the media, but which are pretty hard to find fault with: 1. Increasing protected areas across the state. 2. Publishing key performance indicators for government services and reporting on progress. 3. Reforming the right to information process. 4. Reforming the estimates process. 5. Strengthening the independence of the integrity commissioner. 6. Strengthening the independence of the auditor general. 7. Appointing a minister for open data and a minister for integrity in government.
71. Because Anastasia overshadows everything. She made Miles look like a grinning lapdog who deserved no respect. He acted like an arrogant frat boy talking at people and talking shit instead of listening. She did him wrong by staying in so long. I actually think he is really trying and I think he's worked out that being a leader doesn't mean being a lying dictator POS like she was. She opened her mouth and all that came out was lies. He seems to have settled into the role and if he'd had another 6 months may have been able to outrun her stench. There is a reason she is persona non grata for his campaign. He probably should have cut Albanese out too. Made it more vote for Steven Miles with a distant ALP tag and less vote ALP ALP ALP. If you are a Labor supporter you don't need to see the party tag all the time. But people like me who are desperate to find someone actually worthy of my vote - I might be convinced by the person. I also find it amusing that apart from signs in my area I have yet to see or hear anything from anyone up for election.
72. Strong propaganda and a population of people with little to no media and political literacy. It's really easy to underestimate just how many folk go about their lives "head empty, no thoughts"
73. You don’t win elections. The current guy looses it and you’re just next in line. Labor is loosing it and LNP are next in line.
74. In my opinion it’s crime that has boosted LNP’s chances, people are scared. Labor keep saying crime is down, but where is the proof? The continuing story of youth of bail or good behaviour bonds reoffending while Miles keeps claiming that it’s not happening. People don’t always need results to be happy, sometimes they just need to see intentions to solve the problem.
75. Like marginalised children with trauma histories are the cause of the states problems… laughed at ‘ pearl clutchers’ because that’s exactly how they seem. I also find it amusing that the media portrays these children as some group of organised criminals when the majority of them are angry, bored, and opportunistic who fucking post their offending on social media .
76. There's no such thing. It's just rational voting as it was intended. Calling yourself a swing voter makes you sound more important, though.
77. They actually forgot the positive stuff. A party has to sell the good no matter what (because lobby groups can't run a "this is why you should vote for X" campaign alone - because people ask "why doesn't X tell me this?". You can get away with letting other parties tear each other apart, but Katter, Pauline, Labor and the Green's aren't going to campaign for you. Which means Crisafulli is "who?" to many people. They at least kind of have an image of Miles, but Crisafulli you go on looks. And he's not Hemsworth, he looks more like someone from marketing or sales, who might be a pain to get rid of if you aren't looking to be solicited. Where is the backgrounding, LNP?
