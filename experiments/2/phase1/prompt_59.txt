Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. Exactly. They're communists who want big government and big welfare. Australia is built on humanist liberalist principles. Not humanist socialist principles. Aspiration is good. Not government control of human endeavour. This is what the Greens want. Control by government.
2. Yeah she was horrendous I agree. The carry on with the school next to the Gabba was fkn embarrassing.
3. Agree 100%. He‚Äôs a huge problem for them. He won‚Äôt get reelected. One hit wonder. He had a chance to set himself up, but he‚Äôs failed so badly. It‚Äôs bizarre to see it.
4. I don't understand these complaints, the progressive labour government took all of the good ideas from the greens like how labour co-opted free public transport to 50c fares, or free lunches and breakfasts to just free breakfasts. And yet people hate the greens because their policies are unreasonable? Make that make sense to me.
5. the country is built on socialist agendas mate. they're programs we constantly rely on, take advantage of, and want the government to take care of and expand
6. Show me how they‚Äôve been anti-Semitic? Being critical of the Israel government is not the same as being anti-Semitic and it‚Äôs dangerous to suggest that it is.
7. Or reddit skews younger and we quite dislike the LNP?
8. üòÇ You know someone doesn't understand a comment purely from a downvote. That's impressive.
9. In reality, the possible impacts on abortion access are very real and this affects regional women even when its legalised. Forcing women to bear children (whether by law or access) entrenches poverty which in turn drives crime and creates an underclass. Legalisation in Qld was only a few years back and we haven't even had the chance to address access in the regions. Any greyness in the way our government addresses this issue will make investment and culture shift even less likely. Honestly, this is a terrible day. Not saying there aren't bigger reasons for why the Greens tanked but I do think they are making a big mistake by ignoring the regions.
10. Not gaining one seat is definitely a shift away. Regardless of what you think. One Nation are barely behind the Greens in this result and almost everyone views them as irrelevant. The Greens are on their way to irrelevance as well if they don‚Äôt change very quickly.
11. With respect, you are too young to know hardly anything about them over the last few decades. In 20 years you can comment on their past.
12. How do you come to that conclusion in a preferential voting system?
13. Have never governed and wouldn't know how to. They are anti democratic, hoping to nab the balance of power so the minority can tell the majority what to do.
14. Tim we get it you got 2-3 kids we're happy for ya mate no need to keep telling everyone
15. >Good bye woke culture Is the woke culture in the room with you right now?
16. Your comment is a key example of why we need to better fund our education system
17. üòÇ Look I‚Äôm happy the greens flopped as well but this is a silly comment. Ultimately I think the Greens let perfection be the enemy of good. Max is certainly a divisive figure himself and I think now Federal greens should be very worried. Federal Labor too should be alarmed
18. Don‚Äôt behave inappropriately. Have some respect for yourself and our community.
19. Which also shows they fundamentally misunderstand how preferential voting works.
20. That's what I was thinking as well because I know a few greens voters who did this.
21. I think there are probably decent amounts of ALP first preference voters who put the LNP second because they feel safer with a major party?
22. Most people don't decide based on one party being fractionally more in one direction on an esoteric scale of left to right, they see 2 parties that largely espouse ideas they agree with and pick the one that's more committed to and capable of implementing those policies.
23. I think you are on to something, I think the majority of the Greens voters are (small 'l') liberals who want economic fatness (at no risk to themselves) and action on climate change but are otherwise pretty happy with the status quo. While internally the party has a significant more who would like to see the current economic and geo-political status quo dismantled.
24. I communicated poorly, sorry. Housing affordability and inflation are viewed as federal issues. Rent and grocery caps can be implemented at a state level, but voters look to their state reps to address issues with schools, hospitals, roads, city planning, and basic infrastructure, not issues with the national economy. Edit: this is doubly true if their state rep is from a minor party - inner city wine mums and young working professionals aren't voting for Michael Berkman to fix the national econony. They vote for Michael Berkman to push for new parks, schools, public transport investment, and push against shit like a zipline in Mt Cootha forest.
25. The chance that the Greens have in South Brisbane is that the LNP are only slightly behind Labor and might leapfrog them into 2nd on One Nation preferences, in which case the final count would be Green v LNP (which Greens win) rather than Green v Labor (which Labor win). It‚Äôs not likely at this stage, but possible.
26. Griffith will never go LNP, they were under 40% 2PP vs both Labor and Greens. If the Greens lose the seat it'll be back to Labor. Ryan could go LNP, though.
27. Griffith is traditionally a Labor seat. Why would it magical turn conservative ? ü•¥
28. If the greens primary vote stays this high in this area. The LNP can just preference switch every time and wipe out the sitting candidate.
29. The down votes are delicious. Struck a nerve with the watermelons residing in the subreddit. üòÇ
30. Perhaps we have empathy for fellow human beings and want to see a genocide against them stopped?
31. ‚Äúyour government funding/ arming genocide‚Äù The QLD state government is doing that? Do you have a source for that?
32. These accounts writing inflammatory posts like this can't be human. God I hope you're a bot account and not an adult who votes
33. Too many skeletons in my closet and the unfortunate tendency to swear under pressure and call myself a queer commie.
34. Yeah I suspect that's a lot of my discomfort - I tend to be pragmatic and logistical, and even where I do agree with policy I wanna know how and what will happen. The "those are our policies" is...it drives me mental. Good! They're good policy! We can also shift the Overton window!
35. Mostly the way in which language become activism in political circles - I'm not gonna correct someone calling me Miss rather than Dr, or explain to them I have a PhD, or why it's important. Because I do understand all of that, it's just irrelevant in the context of outreach. Same with a lot of those things. I don't have a whole lot of interest telling people about intersectional concerns for youth crime, right? It's irrelevant. Asking for empathy doesn't require *any* theory. Shit, you don't even need to bring up research a lot of the time. Like I've got a mate who, when we were talking, said "women care a lot about those kinds of things" when it came to home decor and shit, and was surprised the day I wandered off to go sit down while he and my partner shopped as that's usually a "boy thing". I could 'educate' him or whatever, or I could just...accept that and enjoy his company, including that he is super accepting of me, queer people, trans people, and so on. And has a bunch of knowledge I don't about disability, race, and masculinity.
36. Are these numbers not included in the tally as they are counted though? Or do you mean the ~80% ALP to LNP preference is the bit that is no longer valid and is doing all the heavy-lifting for LNP's 2PP?
37. They think they can fix all of Australia‚Äôs problems in one single go, they need to move away from that mindset
38. > Something is better than nothing. Except the items that they keep blocking could never realistically be called something, we should be happily celebrating the Greens for blocking shit policy and fighting for it to actually do anything. They aren't fighting for perfect, they're fighting for the things put forward to even begin approaching good instead of just being legislation for the sake of looking like Labor is doing something, while fundamentally doing nothing to actually address issues.
39. Hopefully, the Federal Greens will read the room, sit down with Labor, and start working towards getting some progressive legislation through parliament. If they don't, it'll just be another four years wasted on posturing.
40. On the Greens side doing data entry and I definitely noted from our doorknock notes that voters were becoming more negative about the Greens in the last month.
41. I don't think that's fully accurate. People have voted against Labor's approach to dealing with these issues. They want better management of these issues. Because in reality some people are so far behind the 8 ball that a couple of thousand dollars spread over these initiatives doesn't make much difference. They want policies that actually reduce the likelihood of needing cost of living support, not a bandaid fix.
42. Berkman claiming that Labor attacked them this election when they very much did not really put me off him tbh.
43. Hey I think you're missing the point. The help to buy scheme does good by allowing more people to purchase a home. You've argued that it's a slim demographic and that's true. Is helping some people not worth it when the alternative (what we have right now) is inaction? The people it helps will be in less debt than if they bought a house off the scheme so I'm not sure what you mean by they will be in deep debt. This scheme is only anticipated to increase house prices by $283 per home for every 100 000 homes. https://grattan.edu.au/news/why-help-to-buy-is-a-good-idea/#:~:text=Our%20modelling%20shows%20that%20for,price%20of%20a%20%24700%2C000%20home.
44. Yet if they'd championed for much cheaper public transport instead of free they might have had a chance of getting it up themselves. Perfect being the enemy of good
45. I‚Äôd love to see Max handed his marching orders at the next election. I‚Äôve never seen a more objectionable smug arsehole in politics than him.
46. ‚ÄúWhat policies do you feel are pure fantasy‚Äú Back in local elections it was then thinking they could buy eagle farm for $40m when the literal laws put the minimum at $2bn, but more likely at ~$5bn
47. He must be talking about the cheaper public transport - oh wait Labor basically adopted that one. Well maybe he means giving free lunches to school ki- wait hang on a second‚Ä¶
48. > The greens have made themselves irrelevant, protesting anything and everything so its actually impossible for the regular person to support them without feeling at conflict and excluded as well. Have an example of something they protest that puts you off?
49. I mean, it was a huge lib swing that they lost. People were worried about labor and not understanding how it works voted labor instead of greens.
50. Agreed. Holding the Olympics and Gabba rebuild hostage for a tiny school is terrible politics.
51. Same, I think that‚Äôs a big reason why Amy Macmahon has lost her seat. There was a very small (but vocal) contingent who didn‚Äôt want to see the Gabba redeveloped and the school moved. For a lot of us in the area it was exciting to get a new stadium & for all the investment that would have come with being the centre of the olympics.
52. There is no downside to democracy. It‚Äôs just you don‚Äôt like other peoples opinions.
53. Call bullshit all you like mate, but even Friendly Jordies has pulled this before. He pulled it during the Qld last state election when he was focusing on the South Brisbane seat. And you know that guy knows how preferential voting works. I've been around Labor supporters a lot, and I am telling you this is a common tactic they implement.
54. As far as I know, no one is "in charge" of the Qld Greens, which just furthers my point about people like Sri turning people off the party completely, because they don't have a leader for the people to gravitate towards in terms of forming an overall opinion about the party. EDIT: I just looked and it now seems the greens will probably keep Maiwar, so maybe this is all BS anyway.
55. I voted one nation first, and the progressive party second. I put greens last, a close second last was the animal welfare party.
56. Their policies aren‚Äôt immature, they‚Äôre literally already in force in other locations or have a history of being used in Australia. Eg. Rent caps in force in ACT right now, and Commonwealth Bank was a public bank before it got privatised. Those policies aren‚Äôt anything new.
57. *We'll freeze rents for two years followed by a 1% cap on annual rent increases* - QLD Greens website Not a single mention of following CPI or anything else you imagined
58. Mate, it stinks of the inconvenient truth. Your being idealistic and not realistic. I have no experience as a surgeon but you know what, I have a RIGHT to tell surgeons how to do their job and if the people vote on me being a surgeon I'm gonna start cutting people open. A bit of maturity would go a long way here. The Greens haven't ever governed. They won't ever. And should stick to their knitting. They are a niche party that should campaign about the environment. They're effective doing that. With 0 experience governing they have 0 credibility to offer economic policies that sit in isolation of the wider economy. You may not like it but it's reality.
59. Your shit is reliant on what regional QLD farms produce.
60. They have something in writing, but they surely aren't talking about them.
61. Look at Jono's reign of terror and what he accomplished (not much) I lived in his electorate and he was always saying "we're going to put a stop sign here" and other wild shit....magically it never happened. Reality is when they have 1-2 seats they have fuck all power to do anything
62. It looks like the Greens vote barely changed. It's more McMahon's fault more than anything.
63. They became not required when Labor took some of these ideas to a more reasonable level. That‚Äôs the point a lot of people are making in this post today.
64. If they were critical of all current wars, then you would be correct. Focusing on only this one makes you anti semitic
65. We‚Äôre not in America‚Ä¶ although you did make me look up the history of abortion in Australia a bit (it‚Äôs a loaded topic; I don‚Äôt have all day). I didn‚Äôt know Western Australia didn‚Äôt completely decriminalise it until 2023. But I think ‚Äúcompletely‚Äù is the determinant word in that phrase. There‚Äôs always a point in the pregnancy/abortion when if you wait too long the baby is just going to come out clearly alive and viable. But I‚Äôm not against abortion; I fully support it. It‚Äôs just like an extremely gynocentric topic that completely hogs the conversation and leaves no opening other ideas in the topic. That‚Äôs why the appeal of it is a trap/bait, it‚Äôs a conversation that needs a lot of explaining to convey well in a way that actually speaks to everybody. (Err this might‚Äôve been the most divisive take I‚Äôve taken on here yet; I‚Äôm not an antagonist to it. The Greens just went about it in a rather dumb way.)
66. We're talking about greens which are proposing things that will destroy the economy and the life and lifestyle of millions if left unchecked.
67. Is that not how democracy works..? Not so democratic when it‚Äôs just major parties deciding everything for everyone?
68. > understand A lot of things must be woke then with the way that guy talks
69. I know you greens don't like it, but the reality.is that you hate progress. I live in the Gabba and the rubbish you carry on about progress in the south Brisbane electorate has its toll on residents. Anti Gabba redevelopment, anti development, anti aircraft noise, anti east Brisbane state school relocation, anti pineapple park redevelopment and on and on. Tonight the majority of constituents and long time residents including our 4 residents since the late 70's told you that the Olympics is coming and the area is changing whether you like it or not and being a Greenie and stalling progress is not acceptable and it's not what the residents want. We want a more modern and livable inner Brisbane.
70. Not necessarily, if they thought that there seat would be between green and labour and that labour may not get the seats needed to form a majority which they may still prefer over having a green member in their electorate with a minority government then they may switch to try to help labour get a majority. Preferential voting allows you to vote who you want and get second best at a per seat level but at a state level it can swing things still. If it was closer between labour and lnp and both were minority governments then it's understandable to want to cast your vote to one of the two rather than one of the smaller parties.
71. I know how preferential voting works but I considered giving Labor my first preference to help their primary vote at one point when they were really far behind in the polls. I didn't want to see a landslide as I also did really like this labor government. I ended up voting greens when I saw that minority government might have been on the cards.
72. Yup that's what I meant by the greens outright losing the faith of the electorate. After all, they held that seat before so some people went from preferring greens to preferring alp and lnp 1 and 2
73. But those people weren't voting green in the first place. They exist, for sure, but they're not relevant to the situation you're responding to. Anyone "who voted green before" and switched to labour to support Miles would still have put GRN second, unless the greens had genuinely lost them. That's the point.
74. You mean this year? Right now it's sitting 58%ALP VS 43 greens
75. Fair call on Griffith, maybe Rudd will come back lol. Ryan is a traditionally LNP seat. Should return to them
76. Sure, but the reality needs to be considered here - what does it have to do with a state government election and how can a state MP impact this situation? If this was a federal election it's a different story, to an extent.
77. 70% of Palestinians support what happened on October 7th. Feel sorry for the other 30% though.
78. If the Palestinians put down all their weapons tonight the Palestinians would still exist in the morning, if the Israelis put down their weapons tonight they would all be dead by the morning! ‚ÄúTo the river to the sea‚Äù who is really supporting genocide
79. Yup. But it's not a state issue. This is where the greens fuck up IMO. They focus too much on big issue social stuff at the lower levels. People can't afford food, they don't have the energy to care about Gaza
80. But take a second and ponder, how would a Greens MP have ANY influence over the issue in Israel / Palestine. Politicians must balance priorities with things they're actually capable of changing / implementing.
81. https://www.wagepeaceau.org/ferra-engineering-boeing-queensland-government-investments-in-the-weapons-industry/ Btw here you go. Weapons manufacturers opperating in Queensland supplying Israel are funded at a state level. This didn't have to be true for my point to stand, but it is.
82. I don't make a distinction between different levels of Labor governments. Sorry! I know that reddit radlibs are really insistent that I should stop caring what a political organization does at other levels of government and just vote for roads or some shit, but I legitimately do not care. I ain't voting for that doo-doo ass party for any position from dog-catcher to prime Minister, you fund genocide at the level of government that actually matters, your whole party is tainted.
83. OK buddy, keep telling yourself the \*very real\* people in this war machine of a system that is capitalism who find themselves emotional about \*genocide\* and imperialism are bots or foreign agents or whatever. Hope it makes you feel really comfortable. I recognize that I am posting in a community that is somewhat of a bubble (because honestly what isn't) and one that is generally pretty opposed to my core beliefs but I would never act like the opinions that are mainstream in here do not reflect some portion of the community. I think the perspective is a mix of self-interest since middle class life in the west is to some extent propped up by imperialism (although who knows how much is real vs perceived), "new-atheist" style islamophobia that is pretty prevalent in US style liberals - even if they refuse to admit it and just a flat-out refusal I see in most corners of Australian life to understand how connected we are to the rest of the world. But I'd never delude myself into thinking the attitudes in this forum are not common across Brisbane. Why am I so inflammatory? Because I do not care about convincing any of you. You aren't my friends and I'm not trying to convince you to do anything. I am also very, very tired of Redditor debate pedantry. So yes, I'm going to say how I really feel and I won't be polite about it (even if that first comment really was pretty tame by my standards).
84. You should run. You‚Äôll get media training. Apparently there‚Äôs an LNP MP somewhere who has published erotica under his own name? Your skeletons can‚Äôt be that bad‚Ä¶
85. As a fellow queer commie, I think more of us running would be rad as Hell, actually.
86. I have never heard any Green politicians talking about intersectionality or mircoaggressions. Are you referencing a particular Greens policy or politician?
87. Agree, and the Greens are focusing on problems that they choose to put at the top of the list of priorities rather than listening to the people. After all, governments are meant to represent the people, not dictate what they think is best. When people are struggling to put food on the table or pay their rent the Greens issues are not going to be a priority for the average person just wanting some day to day relief and to feel safe and listened to.
88. > They want better management of these issues. Then they voted for the single worst group to actually manage it well, it's like having a sore on your toe so deciding to cut your foot off as some form of "triage". > They want policies that actually reduce the likelihood of needing cost of living support, not a bandaid fix. The LNP literally have -nothing- that would even begin doing this.
89. I was specifically talking about the speech he gave last night where he said the federal Greens didn't affect the Qld election. Literally every Greens voter I know switched to ALP over the federal Greens block-everything behaviour (they just constantly vote with the Liberal Party).
90. I audibly scoffed. Maiwar and Cooper has Greens on every billboard and telephone box and they brought in huge amounts of volunteers. I also have a small library of pamphlets and letters on my desk.
91. > Is helping some people not worth it when the alternative (what we have right now) is inaction? The trouble is it's helping like 0.02% of people, while actively making it worse for everyone else, so it's ultimately a net negative that fucks everyone even harder. > The people it helps will be in less debt than if they bought a house off the scheme so I'm not sure what you mean by they will be in deep debt. This presupposed that those people could already buy a house in the current system, that's straight false and the entire bias of the scheme. Let's also not act like people not having full equity in their homes isn't a completely fucked position to be in. > This scheme is only anticipated to increase house prices by $283 per home for every 100 000 homes. Their report shows literally 0 proof or reasoning for how they arrived at that number, just that they "estimate" it.
92. > > > Perfect being the enemy of good In this case, how is it? How is is there any large material difference between what the Greens were suggesting and what Labor ended up copying and implementing?
93. Hey now, can't forget Labor also stole and watered down the GP clinic idea.
94. Yes. Their support of Hezbollah, a recognised terrorist group. Sometimes the underdogs are also the bad guys.
95. Against building more housing in the inner city for starters.
