Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. I suppose that's the Rothschilds. Or Soros? Or peeps from the Bohemian Grove? Or Gates? Or "the Globalists". Which bogeyman is it this week?
2. Just by using LIEBORE we can tell you source your info from Twitter, Musk, Tucker and Rogan. Maybe Sky News when you're feeling less partisan.
3. yeah, they seem to think statistics are just made up for shits and giggles
4. Fuck up, ask yourself the same question. The two parties and their members stood up for completely different things. Suggesting the liberal party won because the voter base contacted their local members is laughable, as their only concerns seemed to be whatever news corp, etc, were "reporting".
5. but OP says if you don’t vote left, your a waste of space. hmmmm. Leftists cannot stand freedom of choice, for instance vaccination mandates.
6. There's a reason why the LNP went with simple slogans as opposed to actual figures as statistics. I'll give you a hint, it's to appeal to the demographic you mentioned.
7. are you suggesting it's questionable for a politician to implement beneficial measures to solicit votes? every single politician in existence aims to do exactly that. Some manage to succeed while others fail. Why does it matter to you anyway? At least labor legitimately assisted those in need rather than suck up to billion dollar conglomerates.
8. This concept of 'buying votes' is so silly. You mean they tried using our natural resources to benefit the working class instead of the mega rich.
9. His 'un-concession' speech said a lot. Shameful, graceless and all about himself, still running the fear campaign when it was all over.
10. https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/100536 The QLD ALP delivered 3 budget surpluses in a row you absolute muppet
11. By Adults you mean a man who wants the government to stop taxing fossil fuels, failed to declare a Sugar Cane field and repeatedly dodged the question on Abortion? Labor actually helped with the cost of living that alot of us are going through right now, and we handed it to a party notorious of corruption and increasing the debt. Debt is good if it's used for good purposes like surpluses or rebates.
12. What else should a surplus be used for other than to benefit the people with programs and policies that improve their quality of life? The piggy bank will be a void with lnp the only promises this slimeball will keep is to cut mining taxes, and line his and his mates pockets for the next 4 years.
13. It is totally fine when u have tax royalties propping up the piggy bank
14. Like it has happened previously with any LNP government. Take a drive around and see the actual national highway being upgraded. Yeah, it's not all happening at once but that is how public infrastructure maintenance has to happen.
15. Fuggin oath. Daintree is farrrked thanks to useless Labor and greenies knobs.
16. My thoughts as well, it wasn't this utopia under anastasia...its all been miles lately and his good ideas...it sucks he has to pay the price of the previous leaderships sitting on their hands, but I also hope he stays on, as he has alot of good ideas that "actually" help the common people and make me think he got into politicis for the actual right reasons...
17. The LNP are probably going to also override the Qld Human Rights Act to toughen up penalties on youth crime. Imo Townsville is cooked as there will be youth curfews and whatnot put in place there
18. "My single first-hand experience as opposed to millions of other people wasn't ideal, so this government is bad"
19. It's astonishing how you LNP dick riders accuse us of having an "echo chamber" when your party completely relies on an echo-chamber to win (Murdoch media) Everyday Queenslanders were reaping the benefits of the cost of living relief measures.
20. How'd you get here? You're not supposed to have unfettered internet access in the special education unit.
21. at what point in my post did I contest the result? If someone was about to hand you a gold bar, only for someone else to beeline for it, grab it, and peg it into the forest, how would you feel?
22. Thank you for misrepresenting my statement. I appreciate that you imagined I questioned the result in your head and don't have a sufficient understanding of how democracy works.
23. You lost too, mate. You just lack the foresight to realise it.
24. How are the numerous cost of living measures they've implemented not necessary, and what does a hypothetical global conflict have to do with state policies?
25. Yes, I'm arrogant, ignorant, and sanctimonious for wanting what would be without argument better for the everyday queenslander. Why are you upset at me for allegedly claiming the moral high ground when it seems you voted for a party that has a history of wanting to legislate women's bodies? Now, let's talk about ignorance. Literally, every single LNP talking point is Murdoch media elephant shit, and they can be disproven with a couple of Google searches. We have this attitude because people like you don't realise just how fucking good we have it compared to the rest of the world.
26. What's with right-wing dick riders putting words in people's mouths? I expressed that I was upset with the election results, which is well within my right. I voted, therefore I can say whatever the fuck I want. There are real things at stake here, and this is the best response you have to offer?
27. Why do conservatards scream communism whenever they get a whiff of the government assisting the public? We're in an economic crisis, mate. Can you even tell me the definition of communism?
28. Coal royalties were paying for them, not the tax payer. Shows how little research is done with this shit
29. It’s how it’s always been. Right now the political spectrum is too far left, and people get sick of it and vote for the other extreme. E.g. Trump, Dutton, Crisafulli. When it swings too far right there’s going to be another knee jerk reaction and people will vote far left.
30. Yeah this is a dumb comment. Majority of people are misinformed to vote against their own values due to fear campaigns and suppression carried out by an extremely LNP-biased media. Why do we have to listen to uninformed people? That would be like me stamping my feet and deserving an equal say in hospital mamagement despite me being a patient a d not a doctor. All voices are NOT equal.
31. "People" are fucking morons and easily led to give a desired response.
32. The projection here is insane. Is there a single leg your accusation has to stand on? The LNP is almost purely proped up by monopolized Murdoch media, who all run the same bullshit talking points. Sorry to insult the deity that is your TV.
33. Most of the media in Queensland is controlled by Newscorp and Nine Fairfax, who push right wing propaganda that favours Liberals and tries to put down Labor. Criaafulli claimed he'd keep 50c fares but Miles managed to do that by increasing Coal royalties to balance the cost. Crisauflli said the Government should stop taking coal companies, so where's he gonna get the money from? Most likely cutting healthcare workers like his former boss.
34. Is Joh Bejlke-Peterson back? Communism? Reds under beds. You need to read more and educate yourself rather then show your ignorance
35. I'm a nurse in the public system, and I have no doubt we will be striking next year. WA, Victoria, and NSW all had strikes during their last EB negotiations. I want to start planning now and letting the new govt know that we won't accept anything less than an agreement on parity with the latest Vic Health nurses EB.
36. Thank you for what you do. I’m seeing first hand the strain that public mental health services are under in this state.
37. They definitely cut nurses last time. And made hundreds of doctors quit over their piss poor contracts.
38. Inaccurate. doctors wages in public system are the lowest on record (when accounting for inflation). Not sure I’d blame LNP. Idk what Queensland LNP is like, but in WA it’s always been the liberals who advocate for better Medicare funding.
39. I don’t get it. Why ambulance service is free ? Should people pay for it? If you are way too poor should the priority to be saved keep to lowest? You know, it’s evolution so it phase the unproductive for the government. Next I think people should allow to be voted only after service the army and got brain washed. (Sarcastic, and sadly I need to write this)
40. Just standing around? 🤣 You people really have no idea how hard it is to work in healthcare And now LNP is gonna make it even harder because of people like you
41. You think ambulance cover is free? Oh look here we have what is called a dimwit. Ambulance cover is added to our power bills. If you pay for electricity then you contribute to the cost of the ambulance service. This come into affect in the 90's.
42. Curious, what was the p.a. investement into health from labour v liberals.
43. Don’t you think it’s ironic you are complaining about less investment in public health and in the same breath saying it’s going to get worse because of population growth???! Who do you think is driving the unsustainable and illegal population growth? It’s clearly labor who are pushing for open borders and are happy to flood the country with migrants to the detriment of real aussies. Let’s solve the problem at the source not complain that LNP aren’t putting enough bandaids on the gushing wound…..
44. Some of us do. I mix with other boomers every day who say that free school lunches will cost too much. But they vote for the party that wants nuclear and doesn't want mining royalties. I seriously don't understand them either. They are kind to their friends and family but don't seem to be able to extend the kindness beyond their front gates or their generation.
45. You know the boomers are the minority age group now. Why are you blaming them for the swing in the election? There are more genx,y,Z voters than boomers.
46. It was a great policy. Very few didn't get "the jab" and the ones that refused were the absolute duds which I was glad to see leave. I got the vaccine in the first group because I was a 1A had no idea what long term side effects were but knew it would reduce my chance of getting covid (and not being able to work for a week during a crucial time) and reduce my chance of passing it onto other people. The reason I was happy to do that was because I'm not a coward and I do what I think is best for the community
47. If you refused to get vaccinated for Covid, you had no business working in healthcare in the first place.
48. In my team it was one person who was stood down and replaced . We didn’t know what Covid was going to do but knew there were all these patients dying overseas and shortages in vents and o2. We all just took it then kept working with full ppe, it was awful conditions but we didn’t have any delays to care . I know oral health and surgery did , but those staff were redeployed and they are still playing catch up . The girl who stood down from my team got a job in private sector and is doing well , still unvaccinated and got Covid badly but only once and survived. I got four Covid immunisations and probably won’t get more unless I have to. I immunise for flu each year .
49. >massive amount of healthcare workers [You mean the 0.6% of all NSW Health staff including admin and corporate?](https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/1000-nsw-health-workers-sacked-or-quit-after-refusing-to-be-vaccinated-20220114-p59oa8.html) Even better, only 325 in all of NSW Health resigned, the other number had been marked as "ceased employment", so we don't even know if they were in relation to the vaccine! On your bike cooker
50. You sound so assured for someone who is remarkably uninformed
51. Which will add to cost of living and inflation , as their mates pocket the increases. But hey , the Libs wre better economic managers ? /s
52. Well they gotta line theirs and their friends pockets somehow!
53. I’m assuming this sarcasm, in which case I’ll say that it’s better off in my pocket than in the pocket of an overseas shareholder of a mining company.
54. And ridiculously expensive. Each prisoner costs taxpayers around $150,000 per annum to feed, house and care for.
55. Watch lnp cut public services like they did last time aka your youth justice and child safety - areas of intended intervention prior to incarceration for young people
56. Not to stop the circlejerk but have you done even the most cursory research into this? Like even just reading the proposed policies on their website? - We will give every child a 12-month individual rehabilitation program after detention. - We will ensure youth don’t fall behind and have the education they need for life, by requiring all youth attend a full schedule of education programs while in detention. - We will provide 24-hour dual-carer supervision by boosting staff numbers in Residential Care homes. - We will reengage kids who have fallen out of schooling and are at risk of falling into crime. - We will prevent crime before it happens and steer kids back on track, by delivering four crime early intervention schools across the state. - We will help youth choose employment instead of crime, by teaching employment skills. - We will get youth back to school or into work after detention by shifting the focus of detention to discipline and rehabilitation through consequences for action This is just all from their website. If you want to argue that these are not good policies, or not specific enough, or you don't think they will actually happen, then go for it, but 'their only policy is more jail time' is just categorically incorrect
57. A lot of people would rather do something useless than nothing at all, on the grounds that you're DOING SOMETHING!!! The same kinds of people will spend longer to drive around a traffic jam than they would have spent in it.
58. As long as we arent paying for their lunches at school! /s
59. How many 12 yo were stealing cars 10 years ago?
60. but they read news . com . au, and other websites owned by the same media conglomerate
61. Have you tried actually living in Tasmania? Libs created the dump, and they're currently making it worse. The dumb cunts can't even build a bridge without it exploding nearly a decade and millions of dollars over budget, and they're trying to push through a stadium without even a semblance of a plan and claiming it'll stick to some arbitrary budget they pulled out of their ass. They're adverse to funding anything for the public good that they can't get a kickback from by laundering money to their mates. Youth don't want to live here because there's fuck all protections for renters who're stuck living in mouldy crumbling homes with inadequate insultation for Tas conditions for $600 a week. And good fucking luck managing to make ends meet when jobs here pay so little compared to the rest of the country, and that's if you can even get a job (massive unemployment rates, thanks liberals!). Add to that the generally low quality of education and record breaking rates of illiteracy throughout the state as the libs make education their lowest priority (probably so they keep getting voted in). And seriously, what culture does Tasmania have, because I'm pretty sure getting drunk on weekdays and going out to harrass minority groups doesn't count. Yeah we've got food and Mona on one end of the state (most of which is privately funded), but if you live anywhere else you've got sweet fuck all to do. Can't get a job, can't afford to go out and do anything, and if you could, what is there to do except keep the local pub in business? Tasmania is a fucking hole where dreams and ambition go to die. I've been to third world countries with better infrastructure and culture than Tasmania, and you're trying to say that libs have turned this place into a paradise? The place is a dump, and it's all thanks to the self absorbed fuckwits that keep voting in the liberal party.
62. As a Tasmanian living in the north part of the state, the city has gotten worse in the last 10 years of Libs. No infrastructure upgrades in Launceston to handle the influx of refugees and immigrants.. during peak hour to get from invermay to kings meadows is nearly an hour, for what normally is a 10 minute drive at most. Job prospects are retail/fast food and even then, those small businesses are shutting shop because.. yes you guessed it, the Libs let no building happen to keep rental prices and housing prices stable… Launceston and the north in general is a thriving dump where you can’t get a good job, the average take home is about $700/wk while renting is upwards of $500/wk for crap. Thanks liberals much appreciated.
63. People seem to lack the ability or the desire to do a little research themselves and it cost the state big time.
64. Where was that same crusty white guy when Labor won in 15,17 and 20. Did he back Labor?
65. I am a critical thinker, so the constant barrage of News Limited articles didn't affect me. But it turned my entire city to LNP and I'm so fucking disappointed. We are literally the Florida of Australia
66. No, they haven't. To do that, they would have to rule out a conscience vote, which they refused to do.
67. Yes, they are mate. Are you in touch with what has been going on?
68. You're not going to benefit from a "golden goose" that just eats its own eggs, either. If we don't tax mining companies, then what's the point of having them here? "Oh they create jobs-" 1. So does every industry, including ones we tax properly. 2. The mining industry, by its very nature, extracts resources that cannot be replaced. Even if the demand for coal remains infinite forever, the supply by definition cannot. Furthermore, the extraction of these resources does irreparable damage to the environment. Not everyone in Queensland works in the mining industry, but the negative impacts of mining affect all of us. It is only right, therefore, that we are *all* properly compensated by ensuring that these companies are taxed. 3. Multinational companies with multi-billion-dollar per-annum profits always bitch about how taxes/labour costs/any expense they think they can bully the government into reducing will bankrupt them/force them out of the country/hurt their feelings. Their goal is to make the highest amount of profit possible with the lowest possible cost - they are literally only permitted to consider things like worker safety or "not turning the whole world into a slag heap" to the extent that doing so is legally required and/or may improve their profits. So they will always, always do everything within their power to prevent any government from taxing them. That does not mean they will actually shrivel up and die/leave if we tax them. It is naive to actually believe them.
69. Hello. Immigration isn't a state issue. The states can't do shit about it. That is how stupid LNP voters are. They voted against FEDERAL issues in a STATE election. Morons.
70. "*which was facilitated by labour*" Facilitated by the Liberals\* since they stopped immigration during the decade they were in power so it simply kicked the can down the road for another government to deal with the massive backlog of applications. Please make sure you have the facts correct. [Source](https://minister.homeaffairs.gov.au/AndrewGiles/Pages/processing-more-visas-faster.aspx)
71. Norway, famously a nation without any natural resource extraction anymore and no wealth from it
72. 1. Crisafulli said it "wasn't part of their plan", and a massive number of times dodged the direct question about a conscience vote in the event that Robbie Katter introduced the issue, which he stated he would do. Crisafulli voted against decriminalising it in 2018 (along with nearly all other LNP members at the time), and in an interview just last year he discussed his opposition to a woman's right to choose. One of the other party representatives said they wanted to ban abortions again but just weren't able to talk about doing so before the election. This is an admission that the LNP know their agenda isn't actually what the majority of people want - which is why they hide all of their policies as much as possible until they gain power and can have free reign to impose their beliefs and corruption on the rest of us. It's never about serving the people. 2. Strangling the planet with carbon emissions will kill it. This is an unchangeable scientific fact and a far bigger issue for everyone than myopically trying to win the made-up game of capitalism. Also profits seem to be just fine, considering the huge numbers of new coal mines unfortunately approved and the fact that the mining companies can afford to run their stupid ad 3 times in a single ad break. It very much smells like the propaganda being peddled in the US about how increasing the minimum wage or providing paid leave would supposedly bankrupt all businesses (despite it working out just fine in all other countries). We could be developing new industries instead of clinging on to old toxic ones due to simple greed. Unfortunately, we've instead chosen to self-sabotage by continuing to ignore science (including other evidence-based policies we could have had under other parties). (3. I personally don't give a crap about immigration. In fact I'd prefer that over governmental attempts to unsustainably keep increasing birth rates to secure the desired number of future taxpayers.)
73. I literally barely ever see right-wing politically-charged articles. Most people get their news from social media nowadays anyway
74. I am thankful, I must be at one of the only completely bulk-billed places left.
75. Yeah the irony is that federal labor is underfunding medicare, and refusing to put mental health and dental into medicare.
76. Bro doesn’t listen to the government. Miles said he was going to open 50 BB GPs.
77. Oh I 100% know they were betting on people not getting ratios. Would like to see their solution when schools that are already struggling to find teachers have more jump ship when EB negotiations stagnate.
78. What do you think is about to happen up her.
79. This is the exact thing this post is warning against. Stop listening to right wing media, Victoria is not fucked, it's actually doing shit to help housing. The Murdoch press has been predicting the total collapse of Victoria for years cos we made Scomo and Gladys look like morons during covid and we keep giving money to infrastructure instead of Gina.
80. Me and my family are former NSW residents and we voted Labor. I have no idea who voted LNP. It doesn’t make sense to me at all.
81. Dont know but expect them to line up to vote on daylight savings in months to come.
82. FPTP enactment actually requires a statewide referendum vote. The worst he can do without calling that is reverting to optional preferential voting
83. They just have zero backbone. During the latest mayoral election I overheard their candidate for mayor say something to the effect of “Yeah, we’re basically like the Greens but less extreme” at a voting location. Nah, fuck off. I’m a Greens voter and that shit pisses me off to an irrational degree. I hate the LNP, but at least they actually *have* principles and ideals. If Labor was willing to take a firm stance on anything meaningful at all then maybe they would have won.
84. It absolutely is. There is a lack of understanding within urban circles about how out of control this issue is in the regions.
85. "This will be the election guys. This is the election that will fix our youth crime crisis, right guys? These guys won't also promise things then walk back on them, correct?" - You fuckwits every election since '08
86. At least under Labour we have 50c fares, so it's cheaper to get around if your car's stolen. That'll probably be out the window soon
87. Let’s not start pretending like crime is not bad, being a victim of crime is traumatic, especially if violence is involved, but even without. Reality though is that the numbers showed that crime was going down under labor, and LNP ran a scare campaign to make people believe the opposite. That is the issue to look at and discuss here, not whether or not the stolen item was insured and therefore it was ok.
88. And run-over a young family while they’re at it the little scallywags.
89. What a dumb take on crime. Oh it’s just a slight inconvenience of someone entering your house uninvited while you sleep and taking your stuff? I hope you never wake to a stranger in your house between you and your loved ones.
90. Tell that to the family down the road that had their wife/mother murdered 2 years ago due to being stabbed by a bunch of thieving kids. Fuck you
