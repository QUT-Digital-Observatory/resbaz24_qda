Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. 100% his honest response to this would be “homeless people don’t pay rates so why would we do anything for them”. They are greedy fucks. For example, the reason the LNP and by extension Brisbane City Council is so hostile to cyclists is because they don’t have to pay registration or parking fines to use roads and infrastructure.
2. He doesn't see them as homeless people. To him, they're just homeless. It's an important distinction since it means that if the homeless are gone, he can think that all the people will be safe.
3. The council isn’t kicking them while they’re down, they’re saving them from electrocuting themselves doing dangerous unlicensed electrical work.
4. If the 205 people who upvoted your comment opened up their spare bedrooms to a homeless person the council wouldn't need to supply power to a homeless camp. Is the issue that we don't have a way to link an r/brisbane armchair warrior with a person in need? Surely a crafty person could build us a quick Google Form where those with more than they need can register their interest to house someone they virtue signal for.
5. It feels like they want homeless people to piss off and die, but they’re being polite about how they say it?
6. But it seems almost everyone is swayed by "community safety". A lot of dodgy stuff is accepted by the public in the name of safety. People will get angry and attack you when you try and explain that people aren't as unsafe walking around as they feel. That's the way it goes. Fear wins out.
7. been like that since at least the Howard years mate
8. When you’re on a low income or need healthcare that you can’t afford, its way too easy to slip off a cliff into homelessness.
9. Is tall poppy syndrome dead? Because it certainly doesn’t apply to our politicians
10. “Australians all let us rejoice, Buddy, hold your horses, It’s time patriotism was, Exposed to market forces, The love of country may not fit, In with efficiency, Costs exceeded benefits, At Gallipoli, Self-sacrifice just cannot pass, A profit loss assessment, Those ANZAC boys were slaughtered on, Returns for investment, A government will only stop, You getting what you can, It just distorts the market, If you help your fellow man…” https://youtu.be/YWIXZzg2KJI?si=wtlPUywi0lCIFKbW
11. Shrinner went out of his way to shut-down the East Brisbane Bowls Club. Its just standing there empty and wasted. It could be used for your idea. Plenty of flat space for tents, access to water, toilets and electricity. Much more easy location to address safety issues. It's structural cruelty to make people live like this in such a rich country.
12. Good luck finding a councillor who will take on the associated issues into their division. It’s not a council issue to solve for.
13. The State Gov earlier this year introduced legislation to allow developers to lodge their applications directly to the State when they have mandatory affordable housing components (and the right infrastructure is there etc). This bypasses local government (who get to provide input but don't get the final say). Has its pros and cons, to be fair.
14. Exactly, there’s actually enough in the current zoning to cover projected demand for over a decade. But instead developers are focused on building luxury apartments as high as possible in the inner city
15. > The LNP + being heartless sacks of shit… name a more iconic duo. Homeless people + damaging public property ?
16. Don't insult dogs! They have tons more compassion. He's more like a cockroach.
17. "Why don't poor people just buy more money?" - Adrian Schrinner, probably
18. If you'd read what has been said previously, they had to constantly send out electricians to fix the damage caused in these parks. It was becoming dangerous for all involved and a complete waste of time and money as if kept on happening. But don't let that get in the way of the constant glorification of homeless people on this sub...
19. If I were homeless, I'd go out front his house and office. Fuck 'em.
20. I can see both sides of the issue, and since I'm fortunate enough to have never been homeless, I can't *not* have some empathy for the people who have ended up like this. However. As one poster said it, if you're going to use public land, whether it be for a picnic or to set up a tent, remember that this space is for everyone to use and treat it with respect. Don't throw your shit everywhere, leave trash out, get in fights, break bottles, tip over rubbish bins, and basically act like an ungrateful degenerate. Don't use mental health as an excuse for acting like a fuckwit and ruining the park for the other patrons, which includes the rest of the homeless folks who are quietly minding their own and not going on drug-fueled rages.
21. Guarantee no one commenting in uproar against this has actually been out and seen the state of the park. You’d think if you’d set up camp in a public park and connected to the local power supply you’d try and keep your head down, clean up after yourself, treat the facilities with respect and generally try to fly under the radar - not trash the place.
22. Yes. The park belongs to all, not just those there to grift and abuse it. Dedicated space somewhere that is policed needs to be setup for them. Not the disaster zone they are currently creating
23. If the Council hadn't been trying to screw people over for years, combined with housing shortages and prices over the last 20, maybe they wouldn't need to camp in the park... The people "spoiling it for everyone" are the previous generation who have done everything possible to board wealth and exclude the most vulnerable groups, to the point that they have to live in a park...
24. Yes a clean bbq is more important than people trying to survive. Clear where your priorities lie.
25. What do you mean by “destroyed infrastructure to gain access to power”? What have they destroy? How did this help them get power? Presumably there is a limit to the number of outlets etc
26. Or perhaps enlist a few electricians to connect things back up.
27. He’s a wanker for this but that statement’s not really wrong. State and federal policies have a significantly bigger impact on housing affordability than anything the council can do. Zoning here is shit and absolutely a council problem but denser housing only goes so far when a) developers aren’t incentivised to build affordable housing and b) investors *are* incentivised to dump all their money into property.
28. Sure state and federal government are responsible for building housing on a large scale. But Council has a huge role to play and could directly invest in community housing themselves. In a cost of living crisis, Council in the 24/25 budget only allocated $4 million to support services for the homeless. Thats 0.1% of council’s budget and bloody atrocious!
29. If we were not 2 days from an election I bet this would not have happened. It’s back door campaigning for the lnp.
30. Importing 600,000 people a year when there’s no homes is bad for homelessness
31. Yes, yet the government can find funds for ego projects and entertainment for the masses. eg. Annual firework shows that benefit no-one, contributes to air pollution, frightens the animals and costs tens of thousands of dollars. I’m sure there are other examples of ego projects; oh, how about Olympic Games, Commonwealth games, endless sporting events. It seems we are re-living the last years of the Roman Empire where the people were kept happy with entertainment whilst everything around them collapsed.
32. The Catholic church is hoarding it's cash for all the abuse pay outs it needs to make now and into the future.
33. They are one of the groups helping the most to provide support, actually. A lot of the people at musgrave are there because they don’t like the supports offered.
34. I agree, what is wrong with these cunts? Fascist fuckers wanna kill women and now the homeless. If I say what I wanted done to these pricks - I'd be put on a list.
35. Bad planning is not the issue here. We are discussing providing the bare minimum of support for homeless people.
36. Find me an article where ALP have cut electricity to homeless camps and called it a "safety" measure and I'll call them deluded pieces of shit too. I look forward to your reply. Ty in advance.
37. Parks are actually public and shouldnt be ‘for’ any particular group of people
38. The role of government is to serve and provide for the people. The homeless are people you degenerate.
39. My rates and taxes should be helping the homeless… who we are failing at an increasing rate. Until our governments provide services and places for these people to safely live so they have a damn chance of getting back on track, these types of setups will happen. The blame lies with governments, who are at all levels, failing us.
40. Ratepayers huh? I guess we should shoo all those freeloading tourists out of Southbank and the like right? So I know, if you lose your house though no fault of your own, where ARE you meant to set up shop? Thats a really shitty "fuck you, got mine" comment.
41. How can they pay rates, if they can't have a bank account, because they have no address. Where can they cook, relax, sort their possessions? Think about the personal experience rather than the label
42. Yes, cutting people with no resources off from the supplies they need to live is definitely the best solution to the tent cities cropping up. Where do you propose they go? Out of the city to the suburbs?? To different public parks?? Street corners?? There are no resources for them right now, so kicking them out is nothing other than a cruelty
43. Also, if they can’t afford bread, let them eat cake. Quote: Marie Antoinette, not long before the French Revolution.
44. I agree to some degree. But this sub is pretty much 95% greens, socialists and communists hence the downvotes.
45. It’s a humanitarian issue, and all levels of government are responsible.
46. less people using cars = lost revenue on fuel, tolls etc. companies which donate heavily to the LNP.
47. It’s so dumb. Even if they’re greedy, there have been so many studies that prove if you put money into helping poorer communities you always make at least $2 back to every $1 you spend. You basically double the growth of any community you do this in. But they always make the same excuses that some people will live off the money and be leeches but so what? If you’re making double the return who cares if a few people want to live that way?
48. >100% his honest response to this would be “homeless people don’t pay rates so why would we do anything for them”. That same sentiment got an overwhelmingly positive response on this sub only a couple of days ago.
49. Of the many things bcc could be accused of in terms of malfeasance, I didn’t think hostility for bike riders was a thing.
50. So figure out what they need and give it to them (electrical access wise). It would be a lot cheaper than repeatedly fixing illegal electrical work. This doesn't fix the problem at all, they still need electricity, they still need to be able to use the internet and they still need to be able to communicate. It's hard enough to get out of homelessness as it is. The only thing this changes is where it's happening. Desperate people aren't going to suddenly stop doing desperate things.
51. You assume these 205 people own a home or have means or space. Bold.
52. The rhetoric around this reminds me of the poem Allowables by Nikki Giovanni.
53. My tired morning brain read this as the Hogwarts years. Then I realised those books were written around then and had a look: Howard government: March 1996 to December 2007 Harry Potter books: June 1997 to July 2007 Gonna refer to the Howard government as the "Hogwarts years" from now on 😂
54. So bloody true, mate. I feel like almost everything is for sale. Now, even struggling kids without support at home are for sale. "Build a private prison, please! Here's 80 million to keep the lights on while we keep the poor kids coming." Phillip Ruddock's wet dream.
55. Barbecues that have been disconnected from power according to the article.
56. Homeless people in the city are not an issue for the city council to solve. Interesting take.
57. Really? I hadn't heard that. Sounds like a recipe for disaster to be honest. State government gets to approve development and doesn't have to deal with any of the problems it creates.
58. There's more bottle necks to development than simply zoning. Developer would happily build medium to high density in the inner suburbs but that's where all the nimbys love so we're being forced into smaller blocks and strata in the satellite cities where the undeveloped land is and not enough residents to kick up a politically significant stink to raise the draw bridge behind them.
59. Hey! How dare you?! That’s a well regarded and established local community business! It just happens to be owned by my mates. — the LNP, probably.
60. https://7news.com.au/news/qld/tents-handed-out-to-shelter-homeless-dumped-by-brisbane-city-council--c-12391183 The LNP council joins in on damaging things too.
61. Don't insult cockroaches! He's more like the wet soggy sink bits stuck in the plug after handwashing dishes.
62. Reality is these people need electricity and instead of offering an alternative solution they offer an unwinnable proposition to those doing it rough. Alternative solutions could involve working with the local charities to setup some temporary accomodative area's with a safer local access points for electricity. A similar thing was done when the bcc facillitates pill testing at festivals and admittedly this costs far more than temporary accomodation in a rough area.
63. In my local park, they do exactly that. they’ve spliced the wiring from the light poles at musgrave, but they keep a low profile, no one cares. One is a muppet who keeps pinching bicycles, but the rest all seem like they are battling their demons, but still present enough to be friendly enough no one really cares about them being there.
64. Because people who are reduced to living in a park are well known for having the physical, mental and emotional resources to manage their environment effectively… I would have less of an issue with the power being switched off if there was a comprehensive, holistic support plan to go along with it. Right now, it just looks like the cruelty is the point.
65. After the few bins in the park fill up, where does the rest go? If people wind up trashing an event space after being there for 6 hours, and a family fills upwards of a single wheelie bin and a half of trash a week, what are multiple familys in a place with few trash disposal locations going to practically do? what happens when they collect it in a bag and a gust of wind takes it because you dont want to sleep next to a bag of trash inside a tent? where do you shower after chasing down slimy trash blowing in the wind? I am NOT saying its right, or ok, even the 6 hour event trash is disgusting, but we already don't have enough bins in the city to handle a days worth of snack wrappers, this is mostly a logistics issue rather than a trash behavior issue.
66. Grift? These are people homeless due to a housing crisis.
67. I feel you have a very jaundiced view of what has bought this to fruition. the last 20 years ????? hardly !!
68. No, it is the consideration that should be shown to others. And vandalism should not be tolerated by anyone !!
69. And it’s not council’s job, who have really clearly defined and legislated responsibilities, to solve their mental health and addiction issues. Nor is it the role of people who have opted into the social contract, pay their taxes, rates, etc to be infringed upon by people who have opted out. Parks are paid for by rate payers, they have a right to the safe and peaceful enjoyment of them, that means, yes endearing yourself with some basic decorum. Or to put it another way, if you can’t play nice with others, you should be removed from play time (restorative justice.) Ideally we would have a social safety net to catch these people, but there is also always going to be a subset of people who various reasons e.g. mental health, addiction and trauma, continue to opt out. Again, that’s not a council issue, that’s a state government and justice issue.
70. I also live nearby, and there is daily smashing bottles, fighting, yelling, and other kinds of drama going on. You can't go near the area without being yelled at, intimidated, or asked for money/smokes. This is a public area that our tax dollars pay to maintain, and it's currently unusable due to the dangerous conditions (broken glass, shoddy electrical work, drugs, human waste, violence, etc).
71. Name calling is not an endearing quality !! People can still act decently ........ maybe you could offer them your place !!
72. in the ABC article 2 days ago there is a photo of the side of the bbq missing with various phone chargers and paper rubbish on the inside of the BBQ, i assume there is a normal powerpoint on the inside of the bbq for maintenance use
73. forced open the door to the BBQ's to access power, destroying them !! also the box on the lightpost. They are dangerous grubs !!
74. "Cursed are the meek" said Jesus, as he gave another beggar more leprosy
75. Yes let’s rig up more illegal wiring so the people in Musgrave park can get back to doing their own illegal wiring. I’m sure a licensed electrician is going to risk their safety & electrical ticket to do that. If you’re so keen, it’s 3 wires mate. You take the liability when someone gets electrocuted.
76. Could could introduce inclusive zoning that requires a percentage of affordable, public or social housing in new developments. Instead most of their approvals are luxury inner city apartments.
77. It's not a wrong statement objectively, but subjectively - he's trying to shift the narrative away from the fact that he in fact cut power from these people in this instance. Bold move to also do it during election week because he knows not much can be done with immediacy.
78. There are homes. They are either under- utilised or intentionally left empty for whatever reasons. Edit:to correct spelling
79. Housing is a state and federal govt issue… it’s ridiculous how little support local councils are getting from state/federal leadership that we are now normalising people living in parks
80. Better tear down the playgrounds too, I know those kids ain’t paying any rates
81. I acknowledge and understand the issues you raise…. Still stand by my statement that parks are for the people to enjoy not setup shop and call home.
82. I don't pay rates as a renter but I reckon lnp would hate renters
83. Schrinner thinks Bicycle users are all greens mouth pieces: [Brisbane cyclists labelled a ‘Greens mouthpiece’ by Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner address City Hall : r/brisbane (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/1f89u1n/brisbane_cyclists_labelled_a_greens_mouthpiece_by/)
84. If they didn't care about cyclist safety they wouldn't have spent all that money on top-of-the-line green safety paint which is haphazardly and disjointedly dispersed in 5m segments throughout the city.
85. LNP are planning to rip up half the cycle lanes and routes in the cbd
86. > So figure out what they need and give it to them. * A home * gainful employment * effective mental health treatment * effective substance abuse treatment Council does not deal with any of the above issues, and the last two.. I'm not sure it exists.
87. Saying that building housing will be a disaster is certainly a take.
88. In my experience working in this area, developers get applications approved for x high. 4 years late, no construction has started but demand is now even higher, so they either sell up for huge profits despite building nothing, or they put in a new application for an even taller building on the same site. If Council pushes back then they take Council to court and whoever has the most money (the developer) will get their way. Private-developers are greedy bastards and they will never bring house prices down.
89. You politics fan boys are fucking embarrassing. When did this American worship of political parties become a thing? I realise it's only a thing on Reddit, and not in real Brisbane, but still, this sub is absolutely cooked with you lot
90. More like the shit stuck in the bottom of a hotel drain, needed to be plumbed into the fuckin' sewer.
91. That's very close to Scott Morrison's brand of happy clappy prosperity theology. >This is the view that belief in God leads to material wealth. Salvation too has a connection to material wealth – “Jesus saves those who save”. So the godly become wealthy and the wealthy are godly. And, unfortunately, the ungodly become poor and the poor are ungodly. >This theology aligns perfectly with the neo-liberal economic views espoused by Morrison. The consequence is that it becomes a God-given task to liberate people from reliance on the welfare state. >So there is no sense in Pentecostal economics of a Jesus Christ who was on the side of the poor and the oppressed. Nor is there one of rich men finding it easier to pass through the eyes of needles than to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. On the contrary, God helps those who are able to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps.[](https://images.theconversation.com/files/275799/original/file-20190522-187147-8mcbf2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1000&fit=clip) [https://theconversation.com/five-aspects-of-pentecostalism-that-shed-light-on-scott-morrisons-politics-117511](https://theconversation.com/five-aspects-of-pentecostalism-that-shed-light-on-scott-morrisons-politics-117511)
92. If people continue to damage something that is provided for free, and then create danger for others, something has to be done. You can't just let that cycle go on forever.
93. Exactly, the damage to the park infrastructure is a legitimate concern. The issue is how the council approached the situation. They just disabled the power without warning, which not only affected the homeless but also the various charity organisations that turn up daily to provide food and support. This is a reactionary response by council, and will not resolve the problem.
94. 1999, when CGT was discounted, marks the start of the housing crisis.
95. Kicking vulnerable people while they are down should not be tolerated by anyone but here you are talking about dirty bbqs
96. The social contract is precisely looking out for people who are at their lowest, not "I'm alright, so suffer in yr jocks." Homelessness at the rate we are currently seeing is shocking and without a doubt requires a greater response at council and state level. But it also requires a social response- it should shame all of us that we've got this problem. We should be looking for anything we can do to help out.
97. Maybe you could have some empathy. The council makes it hard for homeless people. There’s little or no rubbish collection services. Shower and laundry facilities are provided 2-3 times a week by a non-government agency (Orange Cloud?). I’m not even sure where the closest toilets are to these parks. The homeless need support, not derision or apathy. Also I doubt very much that the council have received hundreds of complaints regarding bad behaviour about the homeless living in the tent communities.
98. My impression from that same article was that the BCC permanently disabled the BBQs by opening them up and cutting the cables.
99. When you're homeless and eating or staying warm for the night depends on whether you have access to electricity or not, you might decide to take that risk too I agree the destruction of the park is an issue, but it seems a more obvious solution is to give them access to support so they don't feel the need to do this stuff in the first place. All he's done by disconnecting the power is forcing them to find somewhere else to do the same thing
100. You’re right. The electrical services available there were inadequate for the number of people there and failed. Instead, the council should supply appropriate services where needed instead of **fucking over people doing it tough already**. The option they picked instead was cruelty + turning a blind eye and hoping it goes away on its own.
101. Utilised by people living in them. Huge demand increase drives up housing prices.
102. That might be, I don’t know the numbers. But cutting off power and way to cook food is helping anybody how?
