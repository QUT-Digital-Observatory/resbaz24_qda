Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. Then the LNP will botch the Olympic planning, lose the next election and blame Alp for a poorly funded Olympics. Edit: And people will be too fucking stupid to realise why.
2. State is gonna end up in debt for the first time in yonks and LNP will spend their next stint in opposition blaming Labor for it yet again.
3. [Economic and Fiscal Overview - Queensland Budget 2024-25](https://budget.qld.gov.au/overview/economic-and-fiscal-overview/#:~:text=RESPONSIBLE%20BUDGET%20MANAGEMENT%20%E2%80%93%20FISCAL%20OVERVIEW&text=A%20strong%20net%20operating%20surplus,in%20the%202023%E2%80%9324%20Budget.) \- from the second paragraph: >**A strong net operating surplus of $564 million is expected for 2023–24 compared to the deficit of $2.182 billion estimated in the 2023–24 Budget**. This estimated outcome is the r**esult of careful management of revenue improvements, including royalties and taxes**, so that a surplus has been achieved at the same time as providing additional electricity bill support for Queensland households and small businesses in 2024–25. The 2023–24 estimated actual represents the third consecutive operating surplus of this term of government and follows a record surplus of $13.9 billion in 2022–23.
4. supply-side jesus says that the profits will trickle down eventually, and the royalties will stop this from happening. also, jobs will evaporate if the royalties continue. the companies will take their business offshore, which is a pretty amazing feat, given that the shore and land it's attached to is the entire focus of that business.
5. We missed the opportunity of the decade by electing SlimySafulli. They'll ditch the royalities, sell off public assets, fire healthcare workers, ditch the 50c fares and hike the prices back up... meanwhile Steven was promising to make a public energy company, was going to keep cheap fares, and continue looking out for the average QLDer 😥 I'm actually guttered that the majority of QLD fell for the LNP lies, people consume way too much mainstream media and believe whatever Daddy Murdoch tells them.
6. > For context, in the 2021–2022 financial year, Queensland received approximately $7.3 billion in mining royalties. Retaining even a portion of these funds could have substantial implications for public infrastructure and services. Are you saying the LNP are getting rid of all coal royalties? I know there was opposition to the last increase in coal royalties, but I haven’t seen anywhere that they’re getting rid of the royalties completely. There’s been royalties charged on coal in Queensland since forever, it would be a big deal for someone to get rid of them entirely. Have I missed something here?
7. That’s the one. Gonna be “fun” so I do hope that if this comes to pass, those who voted for this stand by it and don’t complain as their cost of living spiral even higher.
8. 5) Oh we're really sorry about all that environmental protection that happened, here's a boom goes the dynamite to all of that. Get going BHP, fire that ass up
9. Hopefully no schoolies attendees will die from drug overdose but if any do, their parents should sue the Qld government and whatever muppet they appointed as “Health” “Minister” in their personal capacity. Pill testing is documented and proven to save lives. I mean, it’s obvious that it does but there is actual proof for it too. Canceling it would be a decision made out of actual malice towards the people affected, in order to intentionally cause them foreseeable harm. For a government minister to act with actual malice, is clearly outside of their official duties.
10. !Remindme 1 year I feel naive hoping they don't sell off our energy assets. That's generations of impact, just to benefit their buddies' pockets. Fuck. Oh also: Does transphobia feature in their reign?
11. > 4) Due to 1), LNP will falsely claim that ALP has been recklessly overspending and putting QLD into significant debt that they have to unfortunately cut a few things. These will be, Education, healthcare, 50c fares, energy rebate, rego discount. plebs like you and I just don't understand the economics of “we can’t afford these things now that we scrapped revenue from our donors”
12. I have been in health for the better part of 14 years (admin stream) mostly temp contracts and temp again now. Within days/weeks of LNP getting in, I lost my job along with thousands of others. It took me 3 months to get back in and only survived financially because I was married at the time. I'm terrified what could happen over the next 4 years.
13. Public servants lost their jobs; health care cuts (we lost our local hospital that was lobbied for and staffed by GPs at the start, lost our aged care nursing home); rampant environmental destruction; jobs for the incompetent boys (and some girls); property developers did whatever; public education not resourced (think it’s bad now, watch for later); extraordinary powers for police (we do need them, they do need resources but with checks and balances that have been sadly lacking). Am really surprised they still don’t require police and credit checks to be openly displayed with voting materials (for all parties).
14. Ohhhh, I'm sorry my human. You're in for a rough time, keep that chin up. Remember, you're all in it together and you're stronger together than apart. If you worked through the pandemic, I also thank you so much for all of your efforts.
15. It was a slightly different climate back then. ALP were almost completely wiped out. I think there were only two or three left in parliament. I worked for qld health and a large number of us were on temp contracts. I saw the writing in the wall and got a job in a private company and then everyone got fired at my old job a few weeks later. We weren't patient facing, and in my specific place of work we spent a lot of time standing around doing nothing because there wasn't enough work, and too many employees. It was absolutely laughable. I know that wasn't the case throughout qld health though. Just my specific workplace (I hope).
16. If you’re able to go private, you’ll probably notice a take home increase, either through more private referrals or contracted inter-state offers. This isn’t a good thing for Queensland, or the profession - since long term it will obviously result in a worse system of care, but short term if you can adapt, it’s an individual boon. What really sucked is the loss of experienced consultants for new grads, reduced public hospital spending really reduces the access to learning for new doctor, since all the experienced consultants tend to go private. In things like Psychology you’re also going to probably see more of a focus on private practice, which once more changes the type of training new grads will get (less acute, out patient care). But yeah, I guess main optimistic bright side is that in the end if you’re in healthcare, your skills are needed more than ever , and you can leverage that if you’re willing to move.
17. What other kind of party is going to be able to compete with the millions of dollars that the Nationals get from mining companies?
18. Meanwhile, cost of living is actually a massive problem for Debbie. And i honestly didn't see any LNP cost of living policies - did they have any? Any reduction in mining royalties is gonna cripple their ability to roll out more.
19. Personally, I think the solution lies in spending far more money on social services for youths in these areas, most of them come from shit homes where their parents are alcoholics, drug addicts or abuse them. I wouldn't want to be at home at night either when mum and dad have had a few drinks. Build a bunch of social centres open 24/7. Sports facilities, social workers, teachers, beds, washing machines, playstations, whatever. Combine that with changes to legislation giving docs more power to take kids away from homes like these and more personnel. Unfortunately, some of the policies that could make some real difference to kids in these situations have been shot down by noisy left leaning people as discrimination, chief amongst them, the cashless welfare card. The cashless welfare trial was the only time I saw trolleys full of food in the supermarkets in these communities in the NT.
20. I think the problem is this sort of talking down to people like you’re their moral superior. Look at what happened to the Kefus, and realise that multiple people in the same street and suburb have had their car stolen and make a direct connection “that could have happened to me”. That is a perfectly rational reaction for people to be scared in that situation and want the government to do something about it. If Labor had connected a solution that recognised and addressed the immediate problem, and then also the longer term poverty, people would have been more inclined to follow them. You want everyone to check their privilege that they didn’t grow up poor, maybe you’d communicate better if your checked your own privilege too - you’re not going to win points telling people that crime ‘is not that bad’ and calling people stupid, if you’re lucky enough not to be the one suffering it
21. Meanwhile Debbie won’t be there to hold the child’s hand when they’re raped. But will support programs that are anti child abuse without the fucking wherewithal to realise she voted it in.
22. I'm convinced that the it's just a belief of the ruling class that a country needs plentiful struggling workers. You can grow your own or import them. Banning abortion just fattens the struggling class. The scary thing is that I wonder if it hasn't always been this way, you just can't say it out loud. World marvels were seemingly always built by cheap or free (slave) labour. America was built by the 'give us your tired and poor'.. It might be that a country simply can't be all upper middle class but those in power could never say that publicly. So the elephant in the room is a country needs a full cross section of affluence. Don't down vote me because I don't think this is a good thing, I just wonder why as a rich country we can't do better. Obviously the issue that can be tackled is concentration of wealth, that should be top priority. Hypothetically a country of entirely middle class could only occur if you effectively 'exported' the shit jobs to cheap offshore labour, at which point you've abandoned broad humanity benefits in favour of parochial national indulgences.. it's OK for someone to do shit jobs as long as they aren't Australian.. For all of us that think billionaires should do more for us, but then happily go to South East Asia for daily massages and a general sense of 'wealthiness', we are possibly no better..
23. I just don't get why they can't be angry about shit that matters.
24. Just because someone is born in poverty and crime doesn't mean they automatically turn into criminals. There's plenty of people out there born into a situation like above but made their lives meaningful and actually contributed to society and have never committed a crime. Stop making excuses for criminals. These kids know what they are doing
25. What do you say about the gang of young Africans who stabbed a grandmother to death at a Redbank Plains shopping centre and stole her car? The mum stabbed to death in North Lakes at the front yard of her home on Boxing Day? There was Totai Kefu stabbed in his home in Camp Hill last year who didn't serve any time Or the gang who stabbed three randoms in the Vally last year at 3 am as some sort of initiation? The youth crime spree is real, even if rates of crime are lower than a year or five. And that's just Brisbane. Its far worse in other pockets of the state Innocent people are being placed in danger by multiple groups of young kids, and mainstream people had enough
26. you say that, but ipswich and logan voted labor. townsville did vote lnp and i can empathise with them. if fares were 50c in all of qld, we might have had a different outcome
27. Debbie will have to sell her car to make rent, so I guess kids stealing it won’t be an issue for her any more!
28. I think Debbie is smart. Why shouldn't she look out for herself? Why would she want children breaking into her car and that being the new normal? I would vote for Debbie before I would vote for you, that's for sure.
29. Lol but this subreddit was saying people like Debbie didn’t exist and that it was all media hysteria. And now that LNP have won, your comment is top voted hahahaha. So much cope
30. yeah i feel you. i live in north qld, the medical system up here is already overwhelmed. my mil has super advanced dementia and is under 65. the public memory ward has a 5yr wait, the private has 2. the ndis gateway places are fucking useless and only want to help children gain access. i can’t imagine any of that getting better. sigh. i still love you steven miles!!!
31. I work in public mental health in Logan region and I’m scared too. We are already understaffed of clinicians psychiatrist. I’m scared what is going to happen.
32. It is unfortunate, but after the stellar job the healthcare service has done after the COVID pandemic the response from the public is largely a big fist in the oouse. It is again, unfortunate what they think of them. You just have to shrug your shoulders, shake your head and walk away.
33. You're concerned about changing from the government that is currently presiding over 'dismal' system and has for the past decade?
34. You’ve clearly forgotten that Laurence Springborg, as health minister, for the LNP, almost eliminated ramping and had the waitlists on most surgeries down to where they should be. He was the best health minister we’ve had in the 24 years I’ve lived in this state. Meanwhile, labor just keeps spending more money and the problems get worse.
35. We are on track to start lowering interest rates and possibly stabilising the cost of living rises. Of course, the LNP will take all the credit after Labor did the hard work. *Before anyone comments, yes I know this is a federal issue. LNP voters will not know the difference.
36. Like I said in another thread, unfortunately there is a large percentage of QLD voters who need to lick the shit flavoured ice-cream now and then to remind them that vanilla actually isn't all that bad.
37. It just seems so irrational to me that as an electorate we need to ‘try’ the obviously worse option every few cycles when everyone can tell you they’ll fuck everything up and get booted anyway
38. It is a tale as old as time and why QLD is known as the *dumb state*. They get all the things that they vote a labor government in for, they get bored. They vote the LNP in and then they demolish everything, they go "fuck what have we done" and vote them out again. The Joh era though.. fuck me. You can't really uncement yourself from the *dumbest state* moniker after that debacle 🤣
39. I feel like it’s too late at that point. A lot of the changes are really tough to reverse. Newman basically caused a lot of consultants to leave public hospitals and go private. My experience was that a lot of those people were very happy working public but it’s much harder to justify going back when you know it’s a pay cut and worse hours (it has benefits but it isn’t as good). I remember my parents leaving public under Newman and I’m so find it strange that my wife and I could end up leaving as well for the same reason.
40. Yeah this is exactly it. Meanwhile the folks at the top are doing their slash and burn, rape and pillage to enrich themselves, and the rest of us keep voting for more because of culture wars and identity politics.
41. There is going to be some insane environmental destruction to make up for the ring fencing of the last two terms. Holy shit lol it is so bleak to think about, but dumdum is as dumdum does.
42. Agreed. The most important thing this term will be to stay politically active. That means doing more than just voting every 4 years. Attending protests, donating to political groups and organisations, and keeping friends and family up to date will be important. Hold the fire to the LNP so they don't assume they can just walk all over Queenslanders for the next four years.
43. No one cares about arts funding, royalties won't happen,or climate change to the level of extremism that people love to talk about. Not sure what ur getting at with free ambulances, because that's is everywhere regardless of what party is in?? I'd rather see small business start thriving again instead of getting reamed by both the federal government and the qld labor govrrnment
44. reminds me of the 2013 election, "they were in too long, had to do it " um they just knifed abbot tho "yeah but he sucks hopefully the next guys better"
45. The lead paint eating "I already got mine" boomers, religious nutters and whatever the fuck you want to call all of the gold coast.
46. They read the paper and watch TV news. They are emotionally programmed to follow directions based on fear and hate, resentment or uncertainty. Basically, like those in the USA and UK, they don't think at all, they just "react". Anyone watching the "news" for 4 days or more will know it when they see it. Its programming. When they voted they honestly felt like they were "getting back at the government". Some issue, some inconvenience, some personal vendetta based on something real or not, proposed or imagined. That's who. A stolen car in a city 3000km from them and they voted LNP because no one in Labor would lock up a 10 year old. They see a person die in a car crash and its entirely a state issue somehow. They vote in a party that will gut healthcare and community services and thousands will die. Its no problem to them. They can't think enough to connect the dots.
47. Of course they won't learn from last time. The only thing they learned was to be more subtle about stripping the state to its bones for their own benefit.
48. You’d hope so given the LNP don’t have any seats in Brisbane.
49. Don't worry, Brisbane dwellers won't let money be wasted where they won't benefit from it.
50. Though I do not doubt that you will, unfortunately the msm surely won't.
51. Gonna need some viral campaigns, the media is gonna be deepthroating bruz for 4 years
52. Just like Federal Labor has been held to account for not fixing a decade long brewing COL crisis, and the even longer housing crisis.
53. DC is actually going to stop using consultants he said
54. "Got Mine! Fuck You". You will see it the way people drive. In a line in a shop and they are pure as snow. Put them in a car and you need to watch out.
55. Well to be fair, Labor was already locking up kids. And my guess on people not being won by the free lunch and 50c fare policies is because they were correctly seen as cynical and desperate ploys - they were great policies, but why did it take Labor facing electoral annihilation to implement or raise them? Instead they have helped mining companies and casino operators out, while negotiating below inflation pay deals for the public sector. And then these last few years they have given credence to the LNP and Murdoch's lies about youth crime and played the law and order game themselves, which sadly I think is what has led to a shift to the right in society and weakened social solidarity across the state. Hence the woeful situation we are now in. Anyway the main thing now is that we can't just sit idle now these deadbeats are back in charge. I will be at the protest to defend abortion rights this Friday night at 6pm in King George Square - hope to see many of you there!
56. Because those little children are criminal scum! Normal children break rules not laws!
57. Unfortunately, the demographics that tend to vote for LNP are typically in the babyboomer generation so likely won't need pregnancy care.
58. >"let em fuck around and find out how bad the LNP is gonna be" Otherwise known as, pulling a Queensland lol
59. let’s not bring on the anti abortion vote actually lol, these people don’t understand consequences. they have cognitive dissonance to the extreme
60. Yeah man, I’m a student and live quite far away from my uni. When the 50c fares came in I was actually able to *save* money rather than just barely hang on financially. It’s going to be a problem once those are axed.
61. morons in qld: yeah but labor have been in to long so.. could you please go and suffer over there? also morons in qld in three months: HOLY FUCK WHATSEE DOOWUN, WE DIDNT VOTE FOR THIS (also hope everything goes well for you)
62. I feel ya, but ambulances are free in Queensland - might be why you're getting downvoted.
63. The contraceptive pill and its accessibility are not state issues. Nothing's changing there. And if they alter the ambulance arrangements, it means Queenslanders who use ambulances will get bills the same as in other states. And in other states, those bills can be from a few hundred (like NSW) to a few thousand (like WA & Vic)
64. Ambulances are free. There's no talk of making the contraceptive pill illegal. You're being ridiculously over dramatic and that's why you're being down voted.
65. think ur over-reacting. everything will be just fine lol. we aren't american, wtf are ambulance fees? also no they won't get rid of pills. ur fine love, take a chill pill 😭
66. They will once they figure out what racket each of them is going to play.
67. Fear campaigning. Media has been all over youth crime the last few months, so the LNP just jumped on it and ran.
68. Honestly, the only decent thing I can see this campaign doing is actually making the police respond to youth crime. I work in a child protection Resi house and the kids are getting BOLD with their illegal activity…we’ve been threatened with weapons, houses trashed, gangs run through our houses, addresses leaked online, our staff room has been broken into multiple times WHILE WE WERE IN SIDE IT…the amount of times we have called the police on shift only to be told “it’s not a priority” when our lives are at risk is insane. Even told that an unstable 16 yr old with a hunting knife inside the house with YOUNGER CHILDREN wasn’t of a high enough priority…I don’t believe sending children to an adult prison is a safe or good idea at all, but they need to do something to get them off the streets I just don’t know what because those of us who work under child safety (not actual child safety department workers) have no power or say in anything and we just have to take it🤷‍♂️
69. Agreed. FNQ should secede. Might have some better outcomes for the rest of us. Pretty sure they’d be crawling back quite quickly too.
70. If we had no mandatory voting then LNP would have won by more. All the boomers and people who think these things will work always turn out to vote.
71. What really should happen is the LNP gets deregistered on the basis that their values do not agree with today’s standards
72. The idea that an entire cultural shift is needed to change the outcomes for disaffected youth seems lost on most.
73. Partizan politics aside. I do think it is fucking hilarious how dumb the average voter is when it comes to the messaging and the literal policy platforms of both parties. Labor: To long to list LNP:................. nothi- OH WAIT YOUTH CRIME. Yeah actually that is down and a non issue SOUNDS GOOD TO ME IMA VOTE FOR ME (o )-( o)
74. Get ready for the inevitable "WHATS HAPPENED TO ALL ME STUFFFFF. FUCK" that will be funny lol
75. >People in SEQ really don't understand how much regions get shafted. People in the regions really don't understand SEQ is nearly 3/4 of the state's population in less than 5% of the state's area. It's easy to think it's unfair that most of the money goes to SEQ, but that's where most of the people are.
76. It is a possibility. A typical political stunt. But I wouldn't put it past them. I commend him for standing up for FNQ, but he is very backwards in a lot of other ways. Him and his father.
77. > I could be way off but wouldn't be surprised if he used abortion as a way to gain more power. Thing is unless LNP form a minority government, he won't have the power to do shit. QLD doesn't have an Upper House so whatever government is in can do whatever the hell they want.
78. My 38 year old sister and 45 year old brother voted for them. I have no real idea why.
79. Seen it. 2 other comments and a post (if it's still up).
