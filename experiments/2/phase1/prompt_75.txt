Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. I mean if it’s suitably designed to mitigate the flood risk then that should be ok? There is plenty of land around the place that is otherwise not used or under utilised that could be unlocked with the right design.
2. im a swing voter, who ever makes the most sense and is doing things for the communtity, thats who i have always voted for regardless of party, this year it will not be liberals getting my vote, fuck that noise, wants to take us back to the dark ages and suppress women, wants to wind back on drug policies which are proven to work, this guy wants to take qld right back to the 50's. Hard pass for me.
3. The sentiment of “oh the ALP have been in for a while” seems to be the only reason people can think of the vote them out. The state is transitioning to clean energy, they are using royalties to make peoples life easier in cost of living crisis, and Miles steps up when we had some natural disasters up north. Everything positive in QLD will disappear under the LNP, just so their donors can get more money and to ideologically appear to the cookers and creeps of the state. Channel 9 ran hit pieces of ALP every sunday after NRL about some bullshit youth crime problem. All it takes is a quick google search and crime as a whole is down, and youth crime is a problem in like North and Far North Qld, not the entire state. LNP will bring nothing but disaster to the state and I really really hope QLD, the smart state, does the smart thing.
4. I have heard and seen first hand that there is a lot of support for lnp outside of Brisbane area. A large employer for these areas is mining. The lnp benefits the mining industry for personal gain, which in turn supports the workers in that industry and gives assurance that jobs will continue. I think that beats a lot of what the labor seems to be running for eg public transport isn’t prioritised in these regions. A friend of mine who travels inland often spoke about ads saying how labor is shutting mines like Mt Isa- propaganda as that was shut by the company as it was too expensive to extract the deep coal. And although labor is better, they’re not exactly known for standing up to mining industry either. I’m sure there are many other reasons voting lnp appeals to a majority- this is just an obvious example to me
5. Why is everyone just waking up to how absurdly childish and currupt the LNP and their baked on supporters are? Regardless of who wins this election, Queensland has rapidly descended into case study to prove “ignorance is bliss”
6. Unless you are wealthy, own a home and don’t have a uterus, you’ll be fine.
7. I always base my vote on policy and what will have the best outcome for my family. We’re a young family on a single (ish) wage so obviously things like 50 cent fairs, energy rebates and free lunches will make an absolute tangible difference to our lives. Based on this we’re voting ALP However we’re in brisbane, we have easy access to schools, trains, infrastructure etc. I was speaking to someone who owns a business in cairns, they’ve been broken into 3 times and have had their car stolen so naturally when someone says they’re going to do something about it, it resonates with them. Youth crime while statically is going down, but it is a problem in some areas and is easy to paint an emotional response. You only have to look at the NT and the issues they’re having. Truth is there is no real easy solution, however putting the issue front and centre and speaking passionately about it is something that may resonate with someone who has experienced crime Not only that but there is also a bit of herd mentality with business and business owners. I cover a lot of “business networking” events and the common theme is LNP is good for business, even though this may not be factually true there seems to be this idea “if I don’t fall in line with my colleagues it’ll reflect poorly on me and my ability to run business” Finally I do feel that the majority of Australians aren’t just politically engaged. My old neighbour who is a cranky old lady told me that she can’t wait to vote out Albo this weekend. I think buy in large a lot of people just don’t care enough to look into it beyond slogans and vote how they always vote because of their parents or mates etc.
8. You vote for your local representative, not for Premier. Many dont seem to understand that.
9. Nope, and it's a joke LNP is leading their campaign with youth crime. It's even a bigger joke that there are people out there falling for it. Yes youth crime maybe an issue. But definitely not one that is greater than putting food on the table during theses tough economic times.
10. I’m usually of the opinion that no party should be in power for more than a couple terms at a time. But with the state government I’m willing to give that up because all the alternatives (bar maybe the greens) are just such absolute fucking wankers. How hard is it to just actually try to do good for the people rather than just yourself. Or to leave others people’s bodies the fuck alone. We are gonna be stuck with the lnp destroying the state for four years because people don’t like that Miles smiles.
11. Go to their website and read through the plan yourself if you're actually interested. My opinion is that the plan is better than Reddit makes it seem but it's still veryyyy light on details and trusting them in the job is a big issue. https://online.lnp.org.au/therightplan You won't get any positive response to this post.
12. I think he is perceived to be doing something about the youth crime "crisis" at least in northern bris that seems to be cutting through. The guy just seems like a slimy dickhead who couldn't give you a straight answer if it killed him.
13. Boomers and country folk will vote the lnp. Everyone else with half a brain will put them second last because one nation is on the ballot still somehow
14. David Crisafulli is 100% a scam artist and even worse than that he's a populist politician. He was also a senior minister in Newman's government and is on public record saying the Newman government was a good government. He's promised to significantly cut taxes including the royalties tax on mining companies so they can go back to stealing from us. Immediately this makes QLD billions of dollars poorer under the LNP. Which then begs the question of how he's intending to pay for his policies? Likely the usual LNP way, which is massive job and funding cuts to healthcare and emergency services. He's parading victims of crime around in his election campaign promising to be tough on crime by throwing children into adult prisons and then giving children criminal convictions that will stay with them for life. The issue with that is it will absolutely eliminate any chance these kids have at a positive interaction with the community and they'll likely never get a job once they serve their time. Part of me thinks this is deliberate by the LNP to turn these kids into life long offenders as they plan to privatize QLD prisons. Labor may not be perfect but they are objectively better than the LNP in almost every metric. This is proven by statistics and evidence especially in the area of youth crime. Which is significantly down. But the issue is voters are angry over the cost of living. And angry voters are stupid voters because all they want to do is get back at the government of the day even if it means making life harder for themselves by voting in a worse government.
15. LNP voters don't care. I was waiting for the ferry earlier and this really loud retiree was complaining to his mates about how this 50 cents fare and free school lunch don't make sense because they cost 10 billion and more debt to the government. "The green kids should fund it" is literally his words.
16. Electorally, Queensland is separated into two parts, the SE corner and Regional Queensland. Labor will be competitive in the SE corner because of their social and economic policies (think abortion, education, health, etc). The LNP will flip a lot of seats in Regional Queensland because they're perceived to be tougher on crime and in particular youth crime which has been a problem in North Queensland for some years. They also will slow Queensland's transition to renewables, promising more job security for mining communities up there. Overall, there also appears to be a sentiment in the Murdoch media that Labor's shelf life has expired which seems to have worked. I can only hope the tightening of most recent polls will give Labor momentum to seize a healthy minority in opposition but enough rope for Crisafulli to hang himself politically and make the LNP a one-term government here.
17. No, he wants to put teens and kids in jail like adults. Their behaviour is a reflection of their environment. The economy is fked and social media is promoting bad behaviour for clicks. The kids and teens need support and services, maybe early intervention classes in schools. The cost in living needs to go down too so their parents don't feel like they have to work constantly to keep a roof over their heads. Locking them up is just hiding the vulnerable and making them more dangerous. They will have no future.
18. I see it this way. Labor is shit. But they are less shit than the liberals. I can't think of one good thing the liberals have done in the last 10 years. They might have done good things, but nothing notable enough that i remember it. The greens, eh, they are shit too, but still less shit than liberals. The liberals appeal to the older generations, the rich, the people in good high paying jobs, and generally speaking people who vote liberal, their kids will too. They bank on future generations of voters doing the same as their parents. If they came from a privledged, rich family living in ascot, my money would be they are votiing liberal, their kids have only known a good life and their parents likely voted for howard and thought he was great.
19. reducing youth crime will be on their main agenda townsville and cairns has been shocking post covid when it comes to youth crime. when labor say youth crime is down there talking about inner Brisbane but not all of qld they have had plenty of time to fix it but nothing has been done to fix it one way to slow it down would be to lift that covid mandate for police and rehire police that have been sacked cause of the mandate then maybe we might see a slow decrease in youth crime
20. It depends on if you trust their policies and that they will do them or not. Because a few of their policies do have some potential, and I was surprised. For example they recently announced that they would cut funding for external consultants, and instead rebuild the civil service with jobs that pay comparably and that will allow them to build up the civil service long term expertise. On the surface that actually appeals to me. I just have to forget that they are the ones who gutted the civil service in the first place, and frankly I don't trust them that they will actually do this in a real way. Their policy publications online are often like this. Sound ok on the surface, but when you dig into the details they are problematic, or I simply do not believe them at all because the policy goes against their traditional policy ideas.
21. A portion of voters aren't politically informed, or informed by free to air tv / sky news and they have a **very** heavy bias towards the LNP, even if its just showing them more on tv it might be enough for someone to think 'hey that guy looks familiar I'll vote for him'.
22. That depends on your beliefs about how effective his methods will be. Much as many people would like to paint it otherwise, Crisafulli and the LNP are not the big bad who is out to get you, they are people who are trying to put forward their vision for the community. Like all political parties, that usually involves helping out your mates. The LNPs mates are different to Labor's mates, and you may even be mates with their mates - but make no mistake, *everyone* has mates. Personally, I think that the effective things he's suggesting are the following, partially stolen from another redditor: \- Increased funding to early intervention residential programs and $80 million on new court-sentenced facilities for young offenders in remote areas. \- Plans to re-establish the productivity commission to conduct a regulatory review into the building industry as part of their strategy to address cost-of-living issues. \- Increased hiring of healthcare workers \- Plans for the increased construction of social housing But... there are plenty more things that the ALP are doing I agree with, and plenty more things that the LNP are doing that I disagree with. The take-home message here is that *of course* Crisafulli will have some ideas to benefit the community, and some of these may even be good ideas. Anyone who says otherwise is betraying their partisan stance. But that doesn't mean he's the right choice. I will be voting ALP today, and I hope you do too.
23. As someone who isnt racist and doesnt hate the elderly,women,non religious and modern technology I can honestly say LNP does nothing.
24. Does "Be such a bad premier that the memory of him will help Labor stay in for another couple of decades after we kick him out" count? (Well that's only a good thing if other political forces eg. Teals, Greens can get enough influence to hold the Government to account, but that's a whole other debate. LNP=bad whichever way you slice it)
25. They have already stitched up the jobs4daboyz. A mate of mine is hopeful of a Ministerial job. I think the party just hints at these things to get bodies on the ground
26. Im not even following the news or polls, but I suspect it’s regional qld where miles will lose it. Feels like there is plenty of support for him in SEQ. So yeah, not much point raising it in r/Brisbane.
27. I only heard his name for the first time about a week ago, and it's just been a torrent of "this guy is bad" for... reasons? I lose interest _very_ quickly the second I hear anything sounding politics-y. Now, I _have_ actually heard of Miles, but all I know about him is he's part of why we have 50c Translink fares. I have no idea whether Crisafulli is actually bad, or the other guys are just screaming it so they win. I don't know if Miles is actually a good bloke, or if the Translink stuff is just hiding something iffy. I don't know how people could possibly have the time or energy to do all the research to make a properly informed decision, especially with everything being drowned out with "this guy is bad!" garbage everywhere.
28. I see no good coming out of a Crisafulli government, he’s a reactionary misogynist and I dread the likelihood of his ascension to power. There is nothing in his policies that would make the life of the average Queenslander better, nothing at all
29. Honestly, (some) Australians are the most selfish people I've ever met after Americans, but at least americans will debate a little. Australia has some of the lowest media literacy rates in the world. Our comprehension is so so SO low. People who aren't invested in knowing, who don't have to know; don't really have a good grasp on what's happening, because they're not paying attention, unless something affects them. I studied journalism at uni (didn't complete, had a menty b), and was shown a bunch of stats on world media literacy rates as well as other interesting/depressing stats in 1st year. Australia's rates of understanding world politics, world history, important events, W H Y they started happening - is quite low compared to the rest of the world. Also, I think a lot of white australians are really sensitive and stop listening if they're told they're wrong. They don't have the empathy and curiosity to want to know how/why. Not all white ppl, you know who you are, if this isn't you, it isn't you, etc etc. But yeah, huge mental blocks for a specific group of people, people who don't have to reckon with the consequences of their decisions. Also, business has a vested interest in mass ignorance around everything except what you need to know to do your job and surface level entertainment so you can 'keep going(working)'. Yeah, capitalism. Scary word for some people. Sure, it would be nice if people actually learned about it. Black n brown people are talking about all of you in our own circles. But it would be nice if some of you caught up, and took the time to educate yourselves. We didn't get to our place of knowing by not looking for information. Build up your resilience, ffs. we can't teach you if you'r not listening. Who has been keeping all of us behind? Will you become them? Or will you put some effort in and make a change. Sorry for ranting. It's the same conversation I've seen people have for 2 decades at this point, I'm 27. I've heard elders n older people say that some people seem to have the same conversations every election. 'Why are we so behind? Why don't people learn? Why do people continue to ignore whats right in front of them? When will the other shoe drop? When will they realise they're pawns if they're not educating themselves? And these people never move forward from that point. They say the same thing every time, as if there's a mental block that they don't want to confront. Ever. We watch as they kick the can down the road and pass on the trauma because it feels better than dealing with it. We see it in so many people. And like, we get it, ignorance is bliss, and yet, its annoying, and this ignorance is killing the youth. Politics is a game to them, unless they're the one going to jail. Multiple things can be true at the same time. Rant over, if you made it to the bottom, thank you. You'll do better than everyone who stopped. Literally, your empathy, curiosity, and bandwidth is higher than the people who gave up. So a lil treat for you. Good job. I'm proud that you read some heavy shit. It's not an easy thing to do, and it's a great practise to get into. Now do it again tomorrow. Because you can, and you'll be better off for it. Grew up in Gimuy. Life is tough, and its fun to rant every now and then. Comment n tell me where I lost you so i can word it better next time 🤷🏽🫶🏽🪼
30. You only have to look at his business dealings. Shady AF
31. To those with medicinal cannabis prescriptions "smoke 'em if you got 'em"
32. The reason you aren't getting any information about anything "good" the LNP is going to do..... is because they basically have no policies other than running Trump style scare campaigns. They are 100% owned and controlled by the Coal mining industry (look at the donations flow) and far right religious groups. They are just in to setup themselves for cushy pensions and corp consulting positions in 4 years time. It is NOT because "r3dit I5 aN 3cH0 c@amB3r" Every time this question has been asked, any LNP support can't give an answer other than "r3dit I5 aN 3cH0 c@amB3r" wah wah wah. Each one of their scare policies (youth crime etc) has been shot down with objective facts. Their polices literally boil down to FUCK WOMEN FUCK THE KIDS FUCK THE POOR HAND OUTS TO OUR MATES
33. The LNP exists as a political avenue for corporate Australia to get their hands on government money and contracts. They support whatever their donors support. So if you are not a big business owner, coal or mining baron, property developer or something like that, the LNP is not for you and will never look out for your interests.
34. LNP are for the top of town. The richy rich
35. This sub/reddit is an alp echo chamber, so you'll get all the answers you're looking for.
36. Tomorrow will be day 219 of his announced [100 day review](https://www.foxsports.com.au/olympics/queensland-opposition-leader-vows-to-fix-the-mess-after-olympics-crisis/news-story/995866b87814598ce9b97790c5694e43) plan for the Olympics. I’m not much of a calendrist, but I feel like the 100 days could have fit into the 219 day period easily.
37. That’s the result of the LNP running a small target strategy. No one knows what they stand for. No policy details. No costing details. No answer on protecting Women’s reproductive healthcare rights like Abortion. Personally, I think Crisafulli will be Campbell Newman 2.0.
38. Are you actually sorry? Fuck I can't wait for this election to be done with
39. A frighteningly large percentage (edit: after rechecking 44%) of Australian adults test at BKSB 2 or lower for literacy and numeracy. A BKSB result of 3 is considered functionally literate. This extends to media literacy and the ability to access and interpret policy. Edit: adding some links for more info. This is not about calling anyone 'dumb', there are real barriers to developing these skill sets and it makes me so angry that a few people make a whole career out of being as misleading as possible while staying technically within the legal lines. https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/literacy-and-access https://www.acer.org/au/discover/article/the-importance-of-measuring-adult-literacy-and-numeracy
40. Looking forward to Monday so I don't need to see all of the Labor and LNP bot posts here. Not to mention the SMS and robo calling from the big two parties.
41. Stephen Miles has only been premier for a year and a half. In that time he’s done amazing work, and there’s nothing to suggest that it wouldn’t continue. Should he get re-elected. In fact, it looks like things would actually get a lot better if he delivers even half of what he said. If we continue to tax the coal mines this tiny 6% we might actually have enough to pay for the Olympics without it turning into a another “ $300 billion for three submarines” type deal the LNP love to make.
42. I can't wait for this fucking election to be over so my reddit can back to normal. You won't hear any positive things about the LNP here, nor will you hear any negatives of the ALP beyond surface level criticism. The answer to every election cant be 'everyone else but me is stupid' or the 'media is rigged' because that lack of self reflection of why a party wasn't able to convince people to vote for them is how you loose election after election after election. Realistically, the media is rigged is such an old joke considering Labor has been as close to complete power since the Joh Bjelke Peterson era, except for a couple years of LNP here or there.. They've genuine had some of the longest runs of electoral success in Australian history and it really puts a thorn to the side of the media is rigged argument.
43. The mining industry is part of the community isn't it?
44. It’s like a kinda surprise, not until you vote do you find out
45. There is no “can be an echo chamber,” It definitely is one. You should have asked “I think Crisafulli is the devil, why should I vote Labour or Greens?”
46. Yes. Crusafulli will help usher in another 18 years of the LNP being a shadow government next election.
47. Something that sadly a lot of voters no longer consider.
48. I'm so dissapointed in the lack of anything he's brought to the table. If he wins its not because he really tried. More like there was no other options.
49. Neoliberal philosophy is all about small government. It's hard to help the community without spending anything while selling off assets to make it look like you're the "strong economy" party .
50. I will say this, if any politician wants to help the community, they would WORK with the opposition in doing so. Like at the end of the day they are elected to represent the community and the people. Put an end to this party lines bull shit and work together to better the communities which you serve.
