Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. The reason why so many people are passionate is because Labor is focused on vital investments in public housing, affordable transport, lower energy bills, free lunches for school kids, better access to regional hospitals, and more bulk billing doctors. These policies truly help people and contribute to reducing crime rates. In contrast, the LNP is proposing extreme measures like imprisoning children and placing them in re-education camps—approaches that have been tried & shown to be ineffective and deny real opportunities for recovery, while doing nothing to assist those in need. *It shouldn't even be a contender* We have the best-run state in the country, led by a premier who is willing to address problems strategically. This is the strongest leadership we’ve had, especially when compared to the LNP’s shortcomings. Furthermore, they’re threatening to criminalize abortion. While Chrisafulli has promised to resign if crime rates fall, he hasn’t made any similar commitment regarding abortion, knowing he can’t control that outcome.
2. If elected King of Queensland, I'll make all political donations illegal, all political advertising illegal, and any party affiliated persons not allowed within 200m of an active polling station.
3. Anyone who can look at this and not think the LNP are bought and paid for are just drones. When did it become socially acceptable (40% of us) to actively support such obvious pawns and not just pawns but pawns that are racist, hate women, hate the elderly, hate the sick, hate the poor and hate pretty much everyone that isnt the same color and religion as these clowns. Fuck em off kill the party. Let a more human party come through that actually shares our real values as a country.
4. Coal Australia is a lobby group headed by a guy called Nick Jorss. Nick runs a company called Bowen Basin Coking Coal (ASX:BCB) who owe the State a large amount of unpaid royalties. Queensland has a progressive coal royalty rates scheme where when coal prices rise to crazy amounts (due to Ukraine, etc) the State gets higher royalties. Coal companies still make a profit, just not ridiculous profits from war profiteering. These companies aren't improving efficiencies or anything else, just their normal job, so when coal prices are at record levels, it is only fair that the Stare benefits from this. Now that coal prices have dropped, BCB is one of the few companies that are still unprofitable under normal coal royalty rates. Why would they lobby over a million bucks to the LNP? Hmmmmm
5. >THE COURIER MAIL: LNP drops ‘fully costed’ promises…minus the costings. >The LNP’s would-be treasurer David Janetzki has finally fronted the campaign cameras for his big moment, but the release of the costings were terribly light on detail. >... >EDITORIAL: Arrogance on show. >It smacks of a party that is treating voters as mugs by simply assuming they are on track to win and so will avoid any risks along the way. [https://i.gyazo.com/8f3ebd131774f28f8ea350a4f25013b0.png](https://i.gyazo.com/8f3ebd131774f28f8ea350a4f25013b0.png) [https://i.gyazo.com/f474e9a692d4beaae3f7b15e9098ef16.png](https://i.gyazo.com/f474e9a692d4beaae3f7b15e9098ef16.png) Both Shadow Treasurer Janetzki and Deputy Opposition Leader Bleijie have refused to debate QLD Treasurer and Deputy Premier Cameron Dick. The LNP "costings" have revealed Crisafulli plans to cut $6.8 Billion from the Public Service. In 2012 when Campbell Newman committed to cut $4 Billion from the Public Service it resulted 14,000 Public Servants and frontline workers like nurses and teachers being sacked. It's now predicted at least 17,000 Public Servants and frontline workers will be sacked under Crisafulli's plan. I didn't expect Crisafulli to go full Campbell Newman 2.0 this election campaign. But here we are.
6. Sounds like the resource tax needs to be raised more if they have so much extra to go around.
7. It’s for LNP and watch all those royalties deigned to help out with our way of life disappear…
8. Their totals don’t match the ECQ data, I can’t be bothered drilling down, but I’d take this report with a grain of of salt.
9. Well this explains how they can afford to apparently be every bloody ad I get on YouTube. My watch history certainly wouldn’t suggest I’m interested anyway.
10. And the LNP wants to lift the ban on property developers - so they will get more. Let’s just not vote for the pricks!
11. I feel like I’m missing some pieces of the puzzle here, so help me out. Coal wants to keep making $$ > But making the $$$ is under threat because they are in a dying industry “non renewable resources” > Coal “donate” to political parties with the hope to keep them in business > for those political parties to stay in power they need the votes. To get more votes they need the voter needs something in return for their vote. So what is the voter getting in return for their vote? My Skynews brainwashed, right wing leaning parents swallow everything thats fed to them via Ruperts misinformation sewage pipe of an empire. They have been convinced that renewables such as wind generation is more impactful on the environment than coal is. While the start up for that may be the case (haven’t researched if it’s the case or not) the point being that over time its cost will decrease. Surely my folks voting these clowns into power will backfire on them somehow? What am I missing here?
12. Does the Labor amount include the advertising spend in support of them by trade unions?
13. Can someone put that 2nd slide into words for me? I really can't work out wtf I'm looking at
14. Would explain the fuck ton of LNP signage, even for candidates not in that area.
15. Why does this even happen in the first place? We just straight up allow our politicians to be bribed and no one calls it corruption.
16. It's because this election is entirely about coal royalties... Forget youth crime, Olympics BS or Crossriver rail etc. - they are just useful distractions in a textbook case of agenda setting by the media. The truth is that the 80% coal royalties, renewable energy commitments and phasing out of coal/gas have seriously pissed of multinational, tax-avoiding mining firms. So, it's only natural that they completely interfere with democracy and astroturf some absolutely laughable turd like Crisafulli... People are seeming to forget that only a few cycles ago that youth crime was the major campaign pledge by Campell Newman, who ran on adult time, adult time, child boot camps and all the other BS - policies, which caused an increase in recidivism amongst young offenders into adulthood and was lambasted by every major criminology faculty in Queensland’s universities. Like Dutton's nuclear, it simply cannot be considered as a legitmate or effective policy. I was considering moving back to Sydney a few months ago (from Brisbane) but put it off for a bit because I was starting to enjoy it more. But if this prick wins, I'm not sure how much longer I'll stick around to see his smug, corrupt, corporation-fancying face on the TV each day...
17. Wait but the article mentions 2.5 million spent by unions to support Labor and at least 1.5 million in union fees to Labor. That first graph is a bit misleading with this money not included
18. And you wonder why he hates green energy. Plain old corruption.
19. I've got no idea what their policies are, but I kind of want to chuck a fiver to the Animal Justice Party just so they have a number on the board of bribes.
20. Nothing with them waiting to lobby him for a reduction in royalties
21. "Australian Institute of Progress" Let me guess, nothing progressive about it and a centre-right grift "Institute"
22. Damn I’m pro industry thanks op for letting me know to vote blue the rest of my life
23. It pretty much proves that if you really want to change the world, don't become a politician, become a lobbyist.
24. It’s crazy how people think voting for LNP is a vote in their best interests
25. The 3rd party spending for the LNP is a loophole that has to be removed. It's not a democracy when the rich get more of a say, it's something else. But I'm pissed off at this aside; >parties are also eligible for public funding of a portion of their campaigns. I was reading over changes that were slated a few years ago, and I'm pretty sure they are now in effect. The hoops you have to jump though are now absurdly complicated, tantamount to a ban. It's a reimbursement. You have to guess how many votes you'll get and take out a loan or seek donations to spend the money upfront. If you underestimate your vote and don't spend enough then that potential money is gone. If you overestimate your vote you're in the red, you spent money and no reimbursement. And what about if you get 30% of the vote in a seat and 10% of the vote in another? Can you shuffle that spending around? No. You have to spend where you got the votes or no reimbursement. You could simultaneously underestimate your vote in some areas and overestimate in others, burning money you could have earned in some areas but being left in debt in others. Even more crucially the reimbursement is now far more specific on what counts as campaign expenditure. Hiring somebody to organise volunteers? Nope. Renting a campaign office? Nope. Only the cost of material and media that ends up seen by the eyes or heard by the ears of voters counts. TV ads, pamphlets, billboards, etc. My cynical take is Labor don't rely on directly hiring volunteer organisers or campaign offices, they use their affiliated unions that have a different revenue stream. It was only the Greens who were bankrolling a ground campaign through the reimbursements, so Labor removed it.
26. I haven't witnessed such saltiness since my glorious trip to Siberia.
27. That's because Labor and the Greens are terrible for jobs and Industry in general.
28. No sure what is worse if the coal companies or the CFMEU and other unions
29. Good - labour get a lot more on the ground support from unions and community groups because they fund them . University’s , activist groups , government die hard employees that know there jobs cushy jobs on the line with liberals .
30. The LNP just like its interstate and federal counterparts, the libs and nats has absolutely no purpose except to take donations and return the favours to big business, industry lobby groups, religious nutters, the born to rule, the uneducated and people who will happily vote against their own best interests. Much like those disturbing and disturbed Trump cultists.
31. The scariest part is that people have donated nearly $1m to the Greens 🤯
32. When can we stop posting election stuff. All the LNP and Labor shills are out into it slurping away at their masters Peens.
33. How many Australians are employed by or in supporting rolls to the mining companies?
34. So sporting teams are cool with donations but it’s this massive issue in politics - it does suck but it’s a reality - seriously how can they execute change without donations ? And what constitutes a corporation? So it’s okay to take from “small businesses”
35. >any party affiliated persons not allowed within 200m of an active polling station. How will they vote? 🤔
36. I'm giving way more thought to your offhand comment than I should but honestly this blanket demonisation of people involved in politics is reductive and doesn't help people engage with policies and voting and how it affects their lives. I have volunteered at election booths for every election for the last 5 years and have found most political volunteers are everyday people who genuinely believe in the party they are working for, or they have a personal connection to the party, e.g. families who campaigned for the 'one punch kills' laws a few years back. It's the last moment to change someone's mind and you can often have some good conversations, even on election day. I would agree with the political advertising except that most Australians are not going to research their parties using third party platforms; If we stop political advertising we are relying on the general public to get their information from the Murdoch media and other bullshit, that funds only one side of the political spectrum.
37. All of these restrictions only serve to entrench the existing parties. How did the teals win several Liberal seats in the last fed? Heaps of money, lots of advertising and big, annoying campaigns. I live in the ACT and David Pocock spent millions of dollars on ads and had dozens of volunteers at polling booths. If you essentially make campaigning illegal, nobody will ever be able to convince people NOT to vote for the current parties. The whole point of democracy is to let people proactively contest the government of the day. If you find democracy so annoying, move somewhere that doesn't have it.
38. You don't need to make political advertising illegal. You just need to change the laws so that lying in political advertising is illegal (it's reduce the ads by the same amount) 😆
39. Please add a mandatory score card for every political party on promises made vs complied with/carried out.
40. If you read behind the lines, they're pretty much just the political wing of the QLD resources council and are quite transparent about it. idk why that sits well with so many people - almost as if most of our media is also the propaganda wing for the resources council too 🤔
41. I reckon deep down they pretty much hate each other too.
42. They aren’t just working for their donors interests. They’re also working for their own investment portfolio’s too.
43. You were born into a society that was already captured. If anything we're just better at spotting it. We haven't stopped it yet, but we've spotted it.
44. Adding to this, Byerwen Coal mine is operated by QCoal and they are in dispute with the current government over the camp at the site. The camp is not compliant with the planning laws and the Labor government passed a law basically ordering the closure of the camp, and for workers to move to Glenden a town near by. Adding in to this Byerwen was recently shut down after having multiple fatalities on the site. So to anyone else seeing this post and thinking "Fuck you mining companies" keep in mind that both those large donations come from individuals that have an axe to grind with the current government and aren't representative of the wider industry.
45. I can tell you from personal experience, Nick Jorss is a jerk. He has his greedy fingers in lots of businesses. His loyalty is to himself only & his goal is money at all costs. God 🤦‍♀️ I hope the LNP loose.
46. I work in community services, linked with Child Safety. I know if LNP get in there will be cuts to service delivery and I lose my job. Despite the fact our services at capacity and we still have overflow of need… This is actually genuinely scary.
47. >The LNP "costings" have revealed Crisafulli plans to cut $6.8 Billion from the Public Service. Where abouts can I read more on this? From what I've been able to find the cuts are to consultants, not frontline workers like Newman.
48. I see your reddit witch group was mentioned here. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDlfH5yhAts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDlfH5yhAts)
49. Yep the mainstream misinformation it's a sad state of affairs.
50. The mining lobby has been spending big on ads for the last 10mths they want Qlders money for themselves.
51. Far better to accept money from the people protecting workers rights over the money from mining Barrons.
52. No, it doesn’t…they do it on the third party for millions & then can claim they don’t raise as much as the LNP…
53. Apparently amongst the unions up to $15million was made available. But there’s a $1million cap per third party.
54. If you read the second graph, the biggest third-party contribution to pro-Labor advertising is the Mining and Energy Union at about $150k, and the total third-party spend on them is approx $300k. That should largely reflect the trade union funding into the campaign.
55. Looks like the left side is donations, sorted by size (biggest at the top) going to recipients on the right (biggest on top). The one on the top-right isn't even labelled, so it's a bit useless. Generally a shit graph, but yeah that's what it is. Coal Australia donated $1,239,025 and $682,600 went to Australian Institute for Progress and $495,000 went to Australians for Prosperity, etc etc
56. It's deliberately misleading. The OP is a Labor staffer. Have a gander at it's post history. Just another blow-in that turns up around every state or federal election.
57. What's the point in posting it here at the dead end of a old thread? Put it up in a fresh thread Wally
58. You might want to check in on the latest job figures.
59. Well, as I see it, the mining companies are trying to put yet more cash in their owners pockets. The unions are trying to put more cash in the workers pockets. I'm pretty clear about which one is worse, personally.
60. I am sure the CFMEU got that 22% over 3 year deal because they are such a neutral group. Surely nothing is happening behind the scenes.
61. Only one entity you’ve mentioned has been shown to be involved in money laundering
62. Are you seriously trying to compare community sporting groups- with no ability to change laws - with the LNP/political parties? And really, I mean really, not see any issues with companies buying favours?
63. I was going to say except for them going to vote, or clarify that they'd just not be allowed to campaign etc, as I assumed that was all self evident.
64. Sorry, but you are simply giving far too much leeway for politicians to continue as corrupt and completely deaf to the needs of anyone who isn't a giant corporation. If you could make donations to judges, then the court system would be considered a joke. Period. There needs to be a level playing field that stops businesses from having such undue influence over government policies. Just because people cannot grasp the effect that this has, or that political parties don’t actually advocate policies in their best interest doesn’t change how the system works. Modern politics is dysfunctional and Kleptocratic in its current state. Simply, there are no excuses for lavish dinners, gifts, exorbitant political donations and cushy after-politics job for politicians.
65. I'm torn, should it be peninal/clitoral bleeding or just straight to beheadings that should be the punishment?!
66. You know what I dont get is.. I walk around the community sometimes and I see these people with LNP signs up on they houses or in the front lawns. They proud to tell the community they are putrid scums who support racism/elitism
67. The owner of QCoal, Chris Wallin, has some history as well. He worked for government in the Geological Survey, went out in the 90s to drill for coal to increase the government knowledge of coal deposits, quit soon afterwards and pegged/applied for coal permits over these new high grade deposits which ended up becoming profitable coal mines. The man has poor integrity.
68. I pre-polled and did place the Lying Nasty Party last. As that's where they place you. Hope they do not get in and you get to keep your job.
69. Why would LNP fund Child Safety and youth support programs when their campaign and popularity is built on demonising youth and amplifying the problem of youth crime? He needs youth to NOT be well…to rebel…and to resist…so he can feel justified in his tough (read: backwards) approach. It’s so frustrating to watch…knowing that broken systems and a society forced into individualism, capitalism and survival mode CREATES these “youth crime” problems, and THEN convinces everybody that the youth (and their parents) are actually the problem. OMFG. 🤬
70. You'd have to ask the LNP for more details. That's the problem with not releasing full policy details and costing details, there is zero clarity.
71. That was similar to what Newman was promising from memory. In reality what happened is anyone who was employed on a contract lost their job.
72. Well given the amount of lnp stuff I’m seeing compared to labor. I’d suggest the divide is wider than you are suggesting. For these companies. Getting rid of a mining tax, this is just chicken feed compared to the rewards on offer.
73. So you're saying I was just unlucky to see them in my electorate
74. This my friend is where you are wrong. The unions do it for themselves have you not seen any of the CFMEU issues? Unfortunately everyone involved is all about lining their own pockets. Unions, coal companies all of them. Don’t think either is innocent.
75. Keep dreaming that the CFMEU put more cash in the workers pockets, they are a fraud
76. Which part of spending union dues in strip clubs or getting so many kickbacks the Commonwealth Games were canceled is about getting more money in workers pockets?
77. Only one that stops the biggest projects in Australia and QLD whenever their boss did have a free coffee in the morning while collecting kickbacks
78. I don’t say it is right but do you seriously seriously thi k it will change? I’m making a comparison because they usually aren’t giving it out of completely unselfish motives They want a shout out or to be out on jerseys etc trying to bring awareness to their “business”
79. If we've learned anything from the Yanks its not never do postal/mail-in voting. The last time they did it somehow elected a senile gently alive corpse and f\*cked the worlds economy, a senile old man who somehow amassed 10s of thousands of mail in votes in the final hours of the voting period in States that hate him and his parties guts. Lets not go there pls.
80. Yeah the costings are certainly light. Just don't like people and Miles saying with certainty that frontline workers will be cut when there's 0 mention of it.
81. The LNP are so proud of that. We have no royalties, no money to transition to a renewable economy and all the jobs that go with it. And they are proud they stopped us silly Australians asking a price on the resources we sell to them and overseas. We don't sell it, we give it away. For free. And the LNP are proud of that. We are dirt poor and they are proud they saved the shareholders in America from our demands. [https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1105779240906401&set=a.344989720318694](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1105779240906401&set=a.344989720318694) And don't comment, they have shadow banned most people
82. funniest read I had was my union emailing us an election bulletin, which was 10 pages of why education in QLD is in crisis, and then asking us to vote labor as LNP will make it worst. Like labor isn't the reason we are in crisis. edit: look at those downvotes. everyone agrees education is in crisis and I hope everyone agrees that Labor been in charge for the last 9 years. Not sure how it's not labor fault we are in crisis
83. I guess it depends on how much you prefer making your own decisions vs the government telling you what to do.
84. Oh yeah how dare they want you to be free to make your own choices. Those bastards!
85. I've never been a union member, but I've known plenty of union organisers, across multiple unions. Every single one of them have been selfless and hardworking people, going above and beyond to make the workplace better for the employees. They didn't get anything financial out of their efforts. Are there some bad people in unions? For sure. But I'd also remember that big business, and the LNP have a vested interest in making the unions look like villains. Without unions, we wouldn't have weekends, a minimum wage, overtime or paid leave. Overall, unions have undoubtedly been a *hugely* positive influence on the western world.
86. still waiting for the cross river rail..oh yeah CFMEU can't let that be completed
87. Hey Jack ass, it's because those states made sure the mail in voting was counted last, a rule brought in by republicans while telling their base to not mail in, deliberately so they can cry foul about the 'sudden jump' in mail in Democrat votes. And we already allow mail in voting.
88. you know the United States has a House of Representatives and a Senate right?
89. Fair enough. 2012 QLD Election: * Campbell Newman and LNP were light on policy details & costing details. * Campbell Newman and LNP promised lower taxes, lower debt, no new taxes, no funding cuts, no privatisation, & no public service cuts. * Campbell Newman and LNP backflipped on those promises immediately once in office and implemented his Austerity measures. 2024 QLD Election: * Crisafulli and LNP are light on policy details & costing details. * Crisafulli and LNP have promised lower taxes, lower debt, no new taxes, no funding cuts, no privatisation, & no public service cuts. * Crisafulli and his Shadow Cabinet of Bleijie, Frecklington, Nicholls, Mander, John-Paul Langbroek etc. were all senior Ministers in the Campbell Newman Government. Zero mention of X, Y, Z policies **before** an election is a feature, not a bug. We've seen this movie before. IMO, if Crisafulli was acting in good faith he would've been upfront about his policies, costings, and whether he will allow or deny an LNP conscience vote on criminalising Abortion.
