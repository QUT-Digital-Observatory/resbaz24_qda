Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. This is completely anecdotal: I know a now 20 year old who stole a car when he was 16. He went to juvie for a few months and came out with not much trauma from it. Now considering his life: foster care, bipolar (was in a manic episode when he stole the car), severe abuse, substance issues, severe medical conditions etc. he was destined for anti social behaviour in his teens. Now at 20 he‚Äôs had a few years of therapy, is successful completing a STEM university degree, no drugs, managing to live independently and staying almost entirely out of trouble (occasional shoplift or so). If they had put him away for ‚Äúadult time‚Äù his life would be ruined. He‚Äôd have had no therapeutic support, no proper medication, no rehabilitation, no incentive to improve his life. He would have got out of corrections facilities worse than when he came in, probably heavily addicted to much harder substances. Prison is torture, it‚Äôs bad enough for adults but doing it to kids is forcing them into a life of misery. ETA since people can‚Äôt understand why prisons suck, this ISNT anecdotal: If he got adult time, two people suffer (him and the victim). Two people‚Äôs lives are ruined. If he got a ‚Äúminor‚Äù punishment and received genuine help and rehabilitation afterwards (which he did), he can now go on to live a pro-social life and help others through contributing to society. It is extremely unfortunate for the victim but punishing someone harshly by forcing them into a torture chamber that we call prison is not going to solve that issue. We should have better financial aid for those in hardship such as the victim and better social services for people like my friend; because believe me he‚Äôs one of the lucky ones. Many others in juvie don‚Äôt get the opportunity of rehabilitation, they are continually punished with no help which further perpetuates a cycle of crime. Most if not all multi-offender/violent criminals come from unimaginable trauma- usually severe sexual, physical or psychological abuse in combination with a lack of stable places to live or basic necessities being met. Further traumatising someone and labelling them a criminal will only reinforce their view that the world is not deserving of pro-social behaviour and there‚Äôs no benefit to it. Seeing crime as a symptom of something more (poverty, untreated disability and trauma) and treating the root cause will be immeasurably more beneficial to all of us as a society than prisons.

2. *Car theft* in the same category as a bunch of violent assaults? Sounds like some wealthy person is mad about their car to me. I've been robbed 12 times in my life but it never made me spiteful like that, I just wanted whoever was driven to that to get the help they needed at the end of the day. Mostly it IS just kids. What kind of person does this to a child The LNP feel like a cartoon political party sometimes. I feel like they'd fit in well in Gotham City or something
3. So is rape not an adult crime? Might catch out a few private school boys/young liberals.
4. Is this what you think or what you know? If it‚Äôs what you know, can I ask where you got this information? Adult crime, adult time is essentially just a lovely catchphrase with no substance just like most of the other Crisisfooli claims.
5. So does that mean if I do get caught shoplifting I'll be charged like a child since it's apparently a child crime. Oh who am I kidding, no one gets charged for shoplifting anymore
6. It‚Äôs popular not to let murderers off with 2 years and a hug.
7. ~~ Crisafulli‚Äôs brand of populism or Miles‚Äô brand of populism? Edit: why am I being downvoted? üòÇ I didn‚Äôt say there was anything wrong with populism, but you can‚Äôt deny that Miles ran on a platform largely supported by populism, just like how Crisafulli‚Äôs tough on crime was a populist platform as well. ~~ (I don‚Äôt know how to strikethrough on mobile but imagine everything before this has that) Just realising that myself (and I think the person I‚Äôm replying to) have the wrong definition of populism. ‚ÄúPopulism is a range of political stances that emphasize the idea of ‚Äúthe people‚Äù and often juxtapose this group with ‚Äúthe elite‚Äù‚Äù from wiki
8. Or they should only be for life sentences. If they never get released they‚Äôre never someone else‚Äôs problem.
9. I don't think there's an obvious financial motivation for this, it's just the LNP being the LNP, since the only thing they have is playing to emotions. There is no logical plan beyond "tough on crime". The only financial motivation is to get elected so they can bring in other "reforms" for businesses they can get a high paying role at in a few years.
10. Steven Miles has a charity store? What‚Äôs it called? I didn‚Äôt realise he change legislation relating to youth which has been in decline with the exception of a small rise around COVID.
11. You people are very odd, do you think you're clever or something?
12. I think murder, attempted murder, violent assault, Manslaughter and serious assault causing injury would be a good start to lock up the youths committing these offences. Repeated break and enters with violence might also make the list. There also needs a heap of money thrown at prevention programs, but the government is no chance of doing this.
13. Oh that's clearly not criminal. In fact we should just reward people for doing that and vote them in as premiers
14. I'm sure there is some merit to that idea in some cases. But I would not know how that would go, some people are just fucked and no manner of potential punishment is even a factor to them. Because " I won't get caught, and if I do, it's not my fault and I'm incapable of taking responsibility," or a million reasons they could throw at you. There really needs to be a lot more intervention prior to the birth of a lot of these children, and the best cass solution now, won't solve the problem for a generation. These things take decades to fix, and even then it's more so a problem trending downwards. Now if we had far more things for people to do, interventions that where effective, and also clear means for people to make a better life and see a point in giving a shit about things. That would be great. But that requires more than just, crime bad, jail. A tapestry of solutions is required. You need a reason to live, something to do, and people who you care about and care about you. Otherwise you will burn everything around you to fill that void. And fitting in as a teen is very very very important. It's almost life or death it feels like. So if you fall into the wrong crowd your gonna do dumb shit that in a couple years time you will go. Ah fuck I was an absolute cunt. Some mistakes we can come back from and won't do again. Sometimes it's not a mistake and we will keep doing it if we can. Complex shit. The LNP are not capable of dealing with that, nor care.
15. That's why I specifically added the words: In isolation. No we are not just gonna let people get away with shit because punishment 'would be mean'. But the simple minded, throw em in jail, approach just pushs the problem somewhere else and makes a worse one. Now some people can't be helped, it's sad I know. But a lot can. It requires a government that listens to the science and the reality of the situation, not just being able to throw out punchy headlines and relaying more on the stick than the carrot. Thus the LNP make all the problems they preach about often far worse, because they don't know or care to fix the actual problem. Just to campaign on it. And private prisions are a risky incentive for parties to be a little to eager to fill them, and help out doners. They can be fucked if left unchecked. Cos they still need government money, and will operate on bare minimum to seek profit. Or in America's case, provide slave labour basically. Not sure if we do that here, but its possible... Which is what the LNP do in general. They leverage power to shift government assets and capability into to the private sector, because those services will always be required and once handed over basically serve as a cash cow for a doner to then get the Libs re-elected. Like building a road with government money, then selling it to someone who now gets to enjoy the toll fees without having to upfront the costs of producing the asset. They turn the state into a revenue farm, and we all suffer for it. As that is only going to a small part of society at best.
16. Thank you genius, if 'don't offend and you won't be arrested' worked, we wouldn't be dealing with this problem in the first place...
17. Are you under the impression they're not already being punished?
18. That's boomer talking point bullshit and debunked by so many studies and sources: https://www.sentencingcouncil.vic.gov.au/news-media/media-releases/children-who-enter-youth-justice-system-early-are-more-likely-reoffend https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/25/australians-urged-to-ditch-tough-on-mindset-for-youth-justice-as-it-does-not-work https://www.unsw.edu.au/newsroom/news/2020/07/do-harsher-punishments-deter-crime https://www.sentencingcouncil.qld.gov.au/about-sentencing/sentencing-myths/myths-about-sentencing-children In fact if you want to find a studie to support your thoughts you need to go to a right wing funded thinktank like the institute of public affairs (Gina Rinehart funds this one), they couldn't find studies to reference so they conducted their own: (read at your own risk, contains lots of blanket statements passed off as conclusions and emotional apeals with no actual science) https://ipa.org.au/research/rights-and-freedoms/should-we-be-tougher-on-youth-crime
19. I can bet all of these people complaining about actual punishments for offenders haven‚Äôt actually experienced it first hand. Try having your entire home ransacked, including your babies room ripped apart, money box smashed, over $100k in items stolen including family heirlooms. And yes I had CCTV. That‚Äôs how we know from the prosecution they‚Äôre teens that are repeat offenders and up until now get let off. I‚Äôve had to spend thousands as result on therapy, moving to a new house as we no longer felt safe and replacing stolen goods. Hopefully this doesn‚Äôt happen to you but if it does I would bet you wouldn‚Äôt be too pleased seeing a 16 year old get off scot free because they‚Äôre a minor.
20. I know a lot of people that did stuff and got away with it as teenagers, they just grew out of it, and most of them are very successful
21. Lmao this idiot thinks not putting them in prison = getting off Scott free
22. At what cost though? Kicking the can down the road a few years before we have to reintegrate these kids into society, having spent adolescence in prison?
23. What do you think happens when they get out? What do you think happens when they themselves have kids?
24. >The benefit to the community of having juvenile offenders locked up for significant periods of time is that they cannot victimise people while in custody (other than fellow detainees) Which is such painfully short term thinking from the LNP Over a long period of time, this causes a lot more crime But it lets a govt sometimes implement a small immediate reduction, like the tide receding quickly and briefly before a tsunami Which makes it incredibly convenient election bait. You can even blame the delayed tsunami on your opponent if you lose power within a few years. The LNP know it; conservatives all over the world use this exact same campaign strategy. Clinton's in the 90s was famous. NZ's National party just won govt with it recently. Identical campaign. They have a good head start on QLD but surprise surprise crime is actually up there.
25. But with our current prison system for adults they're much more likely to reoffend, around 50% recidivism rates here
26. Good thing we don‚Äôt ask conservative rednecks with zero academic logic
27. It‚Äôs not just about stopping these criminals from committing their first crime. Most of these r young criminals are a lost cause and no amount of deterrence would stop them. These policies are more so about making sure they get what they deserve after committing that crime, and giving them a longer time in prison during which they can‚Äôt harm any more innocent people
28. Or take efforts to keep them on the right track in the first place. Prevention is better than a cure (both are better than whatever LNP is proposing)
29. To be fair, it's not like it is in many states of America. You can get a job with a criminal record here. As long as the offence is not relevant to the job, you can't be discriminated against for it. Basically, you can still get an average job with a criminal record in Australia. Being convicted of stealing a car won't stop you from getting all jobs, it would just restrict your options - Such as no government jobs that require security clearance, security guards, law enforcement, any professional driving jobs, depending on how employers *feel* about the conviction it could restrict you from roles of trust (banking, or healthcare) as well, but that's highly individual There would still be 1,000s of options out there. Also, if you can show that you have reformed (such as seeking education, or not reoffending for 5+ years) you will be in an even better position to argue in favour of yourself for employment. It won't be easy, but that's a consequence of criminal behaviour.
30. Haha yes so true. I‚Äôll probably be one of those but even as a ‚ÄòBoomer‚Äô I always have and will vote labour. Some of us oldies have a conscience and care about the environment and our fellow humans üòâ
31. No but you do have to worry about the crime rate going up so their profits can go up.
32. So what happens when we have our own version of this https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_for_cash_scandal
33. I was speaking with someone last night about this, personally I think the Magistrates need a governing body to keep them all in check and punishing people who need to be punished (which they aren‚Äôt doing at the moment). I‚Äôve heard of some of the comments Mags have made in their court room and dismissing perfectly good evidence because they don‚Äôt like the prosecutor (then saying words to the effect of ‚ÄúThis is my court I‚Äôll do what I want‚Äù). I think if we could reign in the Mags and make them more accountable then we wouldn‚Äôt need to make any changes in law re criminal sentencing etc. 99% million of juveniles are good kids, the other 0.5% come from broken homes and act out but aren‚Äôt too far gone where we should give up on them, and it‚Äôs only about 0.5% that are the true problem, so if Mags would just treat that small population effectively in sentencing, we would likely see a notable decrease in the range of crimes often committed by these youth offenders. / for reference those aren‚Äôt accurate stats by any means and they aren‚Äôt meant to be, just subjective interpretation from all the Youths I‚Äôve dealt with in the Justice system.
34. Maybe free contraception for life should be part of the rehabilitation.
35. The voice lost because it was needless, divisive and dangerous to the harmony of our country.
36. Well, if it suits you, you can go right ahead and make wild guesses.
37. Also.. if you're just chucking out glib one liners.. good one. However, if you genuinely believe the Voice failed because Dutton couldn't accept Labor's position of "we'll show the legislation after the ref. passed", then perhaps Labor should've released the legislation before the referendum.
38. well if you are not a boomer, i gave two options...
39. does the evidence you're referring to take into account that if you are spending more time incarcerated, it is due to committing a more serious crime. I would suspect a child who breaks into cars and goes to jail for 1 month may actually never do that again. but a child who robs and murders someone, goes to jail for 2 years is probably more likely to re-offend. genuinely curious of the break down.
40. What are you suggesting? Prisoners already get access to many facilities and programs that well behaved people don‚Äôt. Have you ever seen inside an Australian prison, they are not even that bad. I don‚Äôt think the answer is more leniency and community orders that are proven not to work. They just laugh at that approach. Lock up the hardcore recidivist offenders (that are responsible for over half of all crime in qld) for lengthy sentences and watch the crime rate fall. Tag them and keep them to strict bail conditions when they get out until they can prove they are not a fuckwit anymore or put them straight back in the bin.
41. That could be said for all criminals. Is incarceration a deterrent, punishment or rehabilitation. It is probably all of these things. The reality for the current repeat offenders is they think they can do whatever they like with impunity. Actions and consequences are important.
42. Yes, that‚Äôs just the price of having a justice system where there are maximum sentences for particular crimes. It‚Äôs better than the alternative of a judge being able to lock someone up for life for jaywalking if they feel like it.
43. They commit adult crimes, which don‚Äôt count towards the youth crime targets ü§£
44. I get that. But the rehabilitation bit can‚Äôt be forced on someone. And if they do more crimes after being released forcing society to ‚Äòrinse and repeat‚Äô then society is at least protected while they are incarcerated again
45. That's unlikely. You can think locking up children is fine but that shows how gutless you are. Imagine throwing 14 yr old or younger kids in jail with hardened criminals. That's a death sentence mate and you should be ashamed for allowing it in this country.
46. I got a friend who just got out of a 15 year sentence. He had to do ALOT of programs and rehabilitation to be released. Furthermore, he seems prety keen to enjoy his new freedoms and not end up back in jail. Sure he lost 15 years of his life, but hes a safer better function member of society now then he was going in. And hes a better safer member of society then if he had of gone unpunished and allowed to re-offend with impunity.
47. Are you sure? I wouldn't trust him. He's probably siphoning off profits to purchase sour gummies on the dark web.
48. Can‚Äôt wait to be sentenced to a time out for breaking my mums heels after using them as mock daggers to fight my brother (we are both adults)
49. I worked in the field for a while. Did several incursions into the juvie to maintain connection with kids I was looking after. Honestly it was horrible. There was no rehabilitation going on, they were just biding their time. If your mate got out without too much trauma, he‚Äôs one of the lucky ones
50. Cool story. What's the sitrep on the victim who had their car stolen? I've been told on this same subreddit the loss of a motor vehicle can be the catalyst to slide into poverty, homelessness, and addiction.
51. If some kid stole my car I wouldn‚Äôt be in favor of them going to adult prison at all, let alone a long time. If they broke in and stabbed/assaulted me or hurt my pet or family? I‚Äôd be in favor of them going to jail forever even if they‚Äôre 16. Cases like your friend are where rehabilitation works wonders.
52. That‚Äôs great - did you check in on his victims of crime to see how they are doing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
53. He wouldn't have gone to juvie for a first offence if pinching a car, ask him how many chances they gave him before they finally got sick of him and locked him up for a few months? How did he steal the car, was it an old shit box someone had left the keys in or did he commit an ag burg to steal the keys?
54. Robbery with violence would qualify Using a knife to steal a car or home invasion while armed with a machete Its the cases like Kefu, the murdered redbank shopping centre grandmother and the North lakes mum stabbed to death on boxing day where these policies are targetting Kefu in particular saw the attackers not even receive any jail time despite invading his house while armed and stabbing him multiple times
55. robbed 12 times and not spiteful. I call bullshit. ü§£
56. I had my home broken into by 3, 13 year olds. They took wallets, phones, my daughters laptop etc. etc., and then stole my car and damaged it quite extensively. Single mother, asleep in house with daughter at the time. Not some rich person losing their car. I felt violated and very exposed from that experience. Financially it was another trauma. I wonder why we can‚Äôt hold their parents accountable? 13 year old‚Äôs out committing crimes at 3 in the morning.
57. Think I saw it with cristafullashit spruking it on election night. ABC article seems to back it up, https://amp.abc.net.au/article/104449352
58. It‚Äôs not shoplifting, how is it my fault that with no training I accidentally put a kilo of salmon through as a kilo of potatoes at the self serve checkouts. If they wanted things scanned properly surely they could train someone to operate the register.
59. Yeah looking for something nefarious is just me trying to rationalise the shittiness of it. It's just that tough on crime nonsense again.
60. Agree with your last statement(s): I think that providing a decent care system, including free food (all meals if needed) and better/more specific education for the vulnerable would probably go a long way to prevent a load of crime. I'd also like to see a complete banning of alcohol advertising, more restrictive sales and an increase public awareness campaign about the damage that liquid poison does to our society and individual health. It's an extremely dangerous substance - but politicians and the general public have been trained over the decades that it's a drink not the dangerous drug it is. If only we had real leaders stepping up to lead us instead of puppets for rich folk and corporates.
61. So what was labor‚Äôs plan? They‚Äôve been in charge for almost 30 years and we‚Äôre in the position we‚Äôre in now where people obviously haven‚Äôt seen any improvement or direction. It‚Äôs not helping the lady stabbed a suburb over from me in north lakes by a kid who‚Äôs been out on bail dozens of times. This ‚Äòdecades‚Äô thing isn‚Äôt a selling point
62. I have witnessed first hand kids commit crimes and be let of with zero consequences repeatedly yes. A group of the same 3 teenagers broke into my house 3 times in as many months. The police knew these teenagers by face on my dads CCTV footage. All three times the magistrates let them of with a warning... The teenager who murdered the lady in Northlakes had been charged 84 times before he committed the murder. [Teen had been charged 84 times before murdering Emma Lovell outside her Brisbane home | news.com.au ‚Äî Australia‚Äôs leading news site](https://www.news.com.au/national/queensland/crime/killer-teens-horrifying-criminal-record-before-stabbing-emma-lovell-to-death-exposed/news-story/7662f306da994f6685984947536d0a9c)
63. They aren‚Äôt, a 12 year old stole my mates car, got sent up to Townsville for a weekend, and came back on the Tuesday, locking them away for 16 years isn‚Äôt going to help but at the moment they go away for a few days and get to come back, you can‚Äôt reoffend if your still in jail.
64. They aren‚Äôt. They are only reprimanded most of the time. That‚Äôs not a punishment.
65. Are you kidding me üòÇüòÇüòÇgo to cairns for a week and see how you like it . Every day there's cars speeding on the road , one came flying down the wrong side of the road while hubby was driving to work. They set them on fire after they've had their fun. They break into peoples homes - one recently breaking into my grandmothers friends house and bashing her with a WENCH. She is 91 years old and is severely traumatised. Do you know what happened to them ? NOTHING . So sick of you lot with no bloody idea what these victims are going through. Break in , steal a car , ruin it . Arrested , out on Friday and steal another car Saturday . People are told to lock their windows while they're driving . A few months ago a girl was walking back to her car from the gym. She got attacked and dragged away from her car , they flogged the living daylights out of her just for her keys... nothing happens to them. They are the untouchables
