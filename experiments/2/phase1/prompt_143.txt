Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. No because I think it was a campaign that made him change his position after they saw stats on the unpopularity of changing those laws and saw their polls shifting. Otherwise sometime in the first 128 times he was asked he could have said they aren't going to change the laws. I think they won't change the laws now. I think they wanted to keep it on the cards before that though or at least keep the possibility of it in the minds of their base. I don't think that pointing out the factual risk that the laws could change when a bill comes forward that we know is going to be proposed, is a "scare campaign". Why do you think he dodged the question over 100 times OP? If he clearly wasn't going to change the laws, then why not say that at question 1? But good on him for getting there eventually though as the state clearly broadly doesn't want the laws changed.
2. I had people coming up on election day saying abortion rights should be rolled back. I don't think that's a scare campaign to say that people are voting to repeal abortion laws
3. The liberals have done a scare compaign every cycle from my living memory. He voted against changing laws and dodged the question when asked straight up what HIS views are. The laws are unlikely to change in his time. But the party as a whole believes a women shouldn't have the right to their own body. This is a fact, whether the laws change or not. Edit: current tense.
4. If they don't, it's because they know how unpopular it would be. Lot of the same people who voted against it in 2018 are still there. The same religious groups who dominate chunks of the party are still there. And they also been fueled and motivated by what's happening in America with abortion. The threat is still there, it's just clearly politically insane to attempt. But they might, and if katter or another Lib pushs the vote then the LNP will implode if they can't do a concious vote. Their electorates would skewer them, as would their base. They where way to sketchy about the topic for the election for it to seem comfortable. It wasn't a scare campaign tbh, it was pretty much a likely risk. There's clear evidence for that being the case, the more you look into the LNP, their history and supporters. Religious zealots will always attempt to change society, as do zealots of any kind. It's in their nature to keep trying. And if you let apathy take hold, then a dedicated minority can dictate policy for everyone else to suffer under. For the simple fact they are trying. You don't play the game, you lose to those who do.
5. The coordinated fear mongering that was being pushed by ALP supporters in the last couple of weeks was absolutely unbelievable. And it nearly worked. I don't know whether LNP is going to be good, bad, or indifferent but the campaign over the last 2 weeks was IMO bloody disgusting.
6. Scare campaign? By who? They’re the ones that brought it up!
7. I don't know why it took a "scare campaign" to concern people on this issue, it is publicly available information as to who voted for and voted against the legislation in 2018.
8. Won an election and still being a bullying prick. Sounds like LNP to me.
9. Honestly, no. It was pretty clearly a scare campaign BUT one rooted in real facts, that the LNP is willing to consider abortion on the table (so to speak) and that KAP sees them as a path to abortion reform. The actual facts disqualified either of these parties from being suitable for even accessing a whiff of power.
10. Will you accept you were taken in by y a scare campaign with his youth crime crisis.
11. If crime rates stay the same will you acknowledge you were taken in by a scare campaign about crime?
12. He never gave a straight answer on anything. For 3 years all we heard from him was “They’re doing a terrible job, I could do much better” without a single plan or policy evident. He refused to release policies until 2 days before the election. 1/3 of Qld had already voted by then. I can’t even pretend they’re a viable alternative.
13. “Now, if you’re asking me about, would I ever support recriminalising it, the answer is absolutely no …” “Do you believe in a woman’s right to choose, yes or no?” he was asked. “It probably won’t work for his TikTok, but yes,” Crisafulli responded. “There will be no changes to abortion laws if government changes in Queensland,” Crisafulli responded.
14. So just to be clear, if the laws don't change. Just as David said, unequivocally, that they wouldn't. That wouldn't be a sign to you that maybe you were misled by a campaign that still has you believing that the laws would most definitely (edit: be) changed.
15. But what if they do put it to a conscience vote and it gets voted down? I.e. Crisafulli tells the troops to pull their heads in at least until the next election?
16. Fair enough. Will you acknowledge at least that Crisafulli kept his word, if the law doesn't change?
17. I actually did read the KAP proposal, and it's not that extreme. The key takeaways I saw were: - Removal of social factors as a reason for abortion after 22 weeks - Removal of the requirement for a doctor to refer you to a doctor who is willing to give you an abortion of the doctor doesn't want to. If i missed something, I'm happy to be told I'm wrong but those 2 changes don't sound that bad. IMO I seriously doubt they'll even do this, but even this proposal is still more liberal then most of Western Europe.
18. This is incredible to watch so many commenters say the same thing. I will repeat, since it didn't seem to sink in for you. If the laws do not change under his government. Which is all Crisafulli guaranteed. Will you cop to being misled?
19. Great to see how you're already posturing to spin the ALP's manipulation and hysteria as some failure on the LNP.
20. Agree. The media were asking very specific questions about a conscience vote, which Crisafulli failed to answer. For me, it is/was about it being a very real possibility based on Crisafulli's answer, and knowing how the votes went in 2018. Why did Crisafulli clearly not rule out a conscience vote when asked point blank time and time again?
21. Crisafulli said unequivocally that the law wouldn't change. I don't care about anything else you just said. If the law doesn't change, will you acknowledge you got misled?
22. I keep seeing this being repeated, but I haven't seen anything to confirm it. The KAP proposal is a few changes around the edges and isn't for recriminalisation.
23. Not at all. Scare campaigns are built on fear and anxiety. It doesn't really matter as to how well founded those anxieties seem to be. With that said - I think you are absolutely correct to observed that this hasn't happened in a closed system, or a vacuum. The approach the LNP takes now may be very different to the approach they would have taken before ALP voters made their voice heard.
24. Was it, I read the KAP proposal, and it wasn't to re-criminalise abortion. Criminalising it would be pointless because even when it was technically criminalised, we had 14000 abortions in QLD every year, and how many of those were prosecuted? The 2 key takeaways I picked up from the KAP proposal aren't even extreme. IMO: - Removal of social factors for abortion after 22 weeks - Removal of the requirement for conscientious objecting doctors to refer you to a doctor who is willing to carry out an abortion. So even if the KAP proposals were passed, the changes would be that you need to decide before the 22-week mark if your social circumstances aren't suitable for raising a baby and you would have to find a docotr on your own if the 1st doctor you see doesn't want to carry out the abortion.
25. Sure. So if the law doesn't change, as Crisafulli said it wouldn't, will you give him credit that he kept his word?
26. You do know that there were 14000 abortions every year in QLD before the 2018 legislation, right? Yes, it might have technically been criminalised, but for all intents and purposes, it was legal. If they had such a big issue with abortion wouldn't they have been trying to appoint justices and police commissioners who would arrest and charge people for it? The 2018 laws were pretty extreme and not in line with public sentiment, so for all you know anyone who voted against it might have just wanted something a bit more moderate like the laws most of Western Europe has.
27. But he did eventually guarantee it, and even described himself as pro choice. So if he keeps his promise, do you think we should recognise that?
28. Intellectual honesty. Think of it as wanting to see good sportsmanship but for politics
29. Youth crime is an issue for many parts of the state, looking at a state the size of QLD and saying that the issue as a whole isn't a problem, so we can ignore the areas where it problem is why the ALP lost. The abortion issue is not the same. There are no electorates in QLD where abortion is illegal.
30. Yeah, but that's their team, and I'm not voting for them for that reason. I'd much rather clean up my team.
31. Agreed. OP obsessed with Labor push on abortion and conscience vote but doesn't bring up the most untruthful part of the whole election, the outright lying scare campaign from the Liberals on crime/ youth crime.
32. in alot of areas crime has increased 2-300% hoe is that a scare campaign, you dont have to take my word for it either the data is public on gov websites
33. This seems difficult for people here to comprehend, but it's actually possible that both teams were running a scare campaign. If Crisafulli keeps his promise, will you cop to it?
34. Preferred their policies overall + was concerned by the LNPs scare campaign of youth crime. Running on a platform of an imaginary crisis doesn't exactly inspire truth and confidence.
35. How It's not exactly news that some people in the world don't support full abortion rights, that doesn't mean their opinions will supersede the law on the ground
36. Even if the LNP had a strong majority of seats any conscience vote would not have resulted in an overall majority voting in favour of prohibiting abortion. The ALP spread a baseless lie in a desperate effort to rescue an unpopular government, and I'm glad it hasnt worked. The danger now however, is that those elements (within both parties) who are pro life are possibly going to be emboldened. Hold a conscience vote now and you'll see Labor members vote in favour.
37. I definitely think it was an important issue to raise; I do think it morphed into something more than that after, however.
38. Great, so if they laws don't change, you'll be admitting you were taken in by a scare campaign? I'll remind you that Crisafulli said unequivocally that the laws would not change under his Government
39. It's OK... you don't have to keep pushing the narrative. The election has happened.
40. >KAP said they would be introducing a bill and unless LNP said there would be no conscience vote A bill that said what? I bet you don't actually know and think it was to ban abortion, quick tip, it wasn't. They were planning to try and pass a few minor changes around the edges.
41. Yes, I agree. Crisafulli's word is on the line here.

43. The scare campaign is that if the LNP got in power, the laws would change. There are always people campaigning to repeal abortion laws. Welcome to politics. But the point is, if Crisafulli keeps his word. And the laws do not change under his government. Will you admit that fears that the law would change were unfounded?
44. You may have missed the part when I said I voted ALP. All these facts are besides the point. My point is that if the laws don't change, then the scare campaign that the laws would change, was wrong.
45. We'll see. I think the campaign was unreasonable in terms of how it was carried out but it didn't have an entirely unreasonable basis - there is a chance those laws will change.
46. I don't think it was the LNP running those ads on themselves mate.
47. What? Who are you even talking about here, me? We just lost
48. So you think the laws will change despite what Crisafulli has promised - i.e., that they won't change?
49. No; I put LNP last precisely because I didn't like his scare campaign re youth crime. Could you answer my question now please?
50. But also he'll allow a conscience vote if KAP introduces a bill, and most of the LNP will vote for it.
51. The same day I saw DC on Ch 7 saying his team agreed with him that changing the law wasn’t in their plans, 2 of his candidates said in press conferences that it would. So the question is whether he has the substance to hold to his promise, and the leadership to achieve it. I’ve never seen many sign of either.
52. I don't know if you are acknowledging the situation. Katter said he would take a bill to parliament. Most lnp members would support abortion being illegal again. So they can have a conscious vote and vote against it. Whether it happens or not, there is a risk every day they are in that this could happen, and the more seats they have the more likely
53. He previously voted against the women's right to choose and against euthanasia. We know where he stands. Regardless of the law change, I don't want religious nuts in charge. Even if it was a scare campaign, I'm all for it. Anything to keep LNP from power
54. If it doesn’t happen. Maybe it’s because labour made such a big deal out of it that LNP realised they couldn’t be sneaky about it or make changes without a big backlash.
55. No I think it will be a sign that the campaign worked. Why do you think that when asked over 100 times he couldn't just say no, we aren't changing the laws? Why do you think he took so long to do that? And even when he did, he still wouldn't actually comit saying that if the bill was proposed he would vote against it and wouldn't commit to not having a conscience vote. I don't think the laws will change now. I think prior to him being blasted over this they wanted to keep it on the table but they saw what the public sentiment was and that this was going to be an issue for them. That's an effective campaign based on a factual risk that was there, not a scare campaign.
56. it would be a sign to me that they are spooked by how much closer the election was than even a month ago
57. I'd argue the last decade or two of LNP campaigns around the country have made baseless fear mongering okay
58. How did you feel about the Labors patient tax campaign by the LNP? A tax that wasn't a new tax. Wasn't created by Labor. Wasn't imposed by Labor. Labor was already exempting doctors from, currently and retrospectively, and had pledged to make that permanent after the election. This was an issue where the LNP and Labor actually had the identical position on, and yet, "Labors patient tax". That was a lie, and they kept running with it to scare you. Contrast that with the abortion issue. It was true that a bill was going to be proposed. It was true that Crisafuli and 80% of the LNP voted against legalisation. It was true that he wouldn't answer 100+ questions on whether they would have a conscience vote, or how he would vote. It was true that some potential MPs publicly said they were going to change the laws. When they saw their polls shift, he finally said there will be "no changes to the law" which is great, but about 100 questions too late. Even after he finally said they won't change the law, he still wouldn't commit to saying that if katter proposes the bill that he would vote against it, and wouldn't commit to saying they wouldn't have a conscience vote. He just brushed it off every time with the non answer of "that's not our plan". I don't think that abortion laws are going to change this term. But I think that a serious risk of it was there. That was not a scare campaign. The patient tax though, that was.
59. Are you sure they are voters,?I'm assuming most of these people are 15 years old.
60. Risk was still there so isn’t that inline to what was called out? It’s politics - nothing is guaranteed on both ends. It was obviously tactical to point out womens rights were at risk - so from my POV, message was fair - delivery style, definitely scare tactic.
61. yes, absolutely- i’m not under the pretence that crisafulli himself is secretly planning to turn us into some handmaids tale dystopia, i want to make that clear. i’m just disappointed that katter & lnp party members being anti-choice hasn’t shifted peoples voting in those specific seats. that’s been frustrating as a young woman in qld.
62. They don't sound that bad to you. But I'm guessing you don't have a uterus.
63. What like the patients tax? They hammered that home around where I live and you know it’s a load of bollocks.
64. I'll accept that Crisafulli has been wedged on this, if the laws don't change it won't be because he doesn't want them to, it will be because he tried to ignore it and play it down, but got called out on it to the point that he could not ignore it. I wonder, if this never came up during the campaign, if he was never asked but also did not campaign on it, would it change? I'd say yes, since it wouldn't have been ruled in or out, and they can say their position over years has been clear. At the end of the day, sadly what politicians say can't be believed (shock!) but what can be believed is their record and previous positions.
65. This is a pointless discussion. Let's see what actually happens, eh?
66. Even if the laws don't change.( And that would only be because there would be a huge public backlash and currently there isn't in katter country) there is the possibility that they will or could have, as KAP have a bill that LNP will likely support. So no. I wasn't mislead. I've read KAPs position. I understand how a conscience vote works for LNP.
67. Because it doesn't matter how he does it. What he said was that the law wouldn't change. If the law doesn't change. If he keeps his word. Will you admit you got taken in?
68. What you need to understand is that until he rules out a conscience vote, he can't guarantee it won't change. It's not in his control unless he does that. There **will** be a bill put forward by Katter to change the laws. Robbie has committed himself to that, and 93% of the LNP voted against decriminalizing abortion in the first place so a conscience vote will likely support Katter's bill.
69. >Scare campaigns are built on fear and anxiety. It doesn't really matter as to how well founded those anxieties seem to be. That's nonsense. Fear and anxiety about something awful that may well occur isn't irrational, it's merely an assessment of risk. It is a logical and sensible reaction to relevant information. A 'scare campaign' that has a solid grounding in verified fact is just a campaign.
70. Eventually … and yeah he was clear in his speech last night and I take some reassurance from that. The point is that it wasn’t a scare campaign. It was people being scared because of how he handled the questions initially. Those are different things. A clear answer at the start would have shut it down right away.
71. From reading your responses it seems like you’re now more motivated by being right than what people think?
72. I'm sure it is an issue. The LNP won't fix it, and will probably make it worse with their punitive policies, is the point.
73. "Whataboutism can provide necessary context into whether or not a particular line of critique is relevant or fair, and behavior that may be imperfect by international standards may be appropriate in a given geopolitical neighborhood.[7] Accusing an interlocutor of whataboutism can also in itself be manipulative and serve the motive of discrediting, as critical talking points can be used selectively and purposefully even as the starting point of the conversation (cf. agenda setting, framing, framing effect, priming, cherry picking). The deviation from them can then be branded as whataboutism.[citation needed] Both whataboutism and the accusation of it are forms of strategic framing and have a framing effect." Did you even read the Wikipedia article you referenced? Or are just a retarded? Stop listening to political commentators and read some books you fucking parrot.
74. It would of course be a net positive if he (or worked to stop those in his own party) didn't take away a basic human right from women yes, and if that's the only hurdle he needs to prove then it is a fairly low bar..........
75. only curious, are there any changes you think would've brought in a larger majority than the LNP?
76. Increases trauma for women who have chosen or needed to have an abortion by drumming up debate around it. There’s always some unsavoury dialogue and judgment of women that comes along with it. So it’s inherently damaging for our social discourse. Debating it in parliament when there is no plan to change the law (according to Crisafulli) creates unnecessary divisions in society. Also fear or losing those rights is disempowering to women.
77. Wait so you're saying there's a danger that we could see the laws change with a conscience vote?
78. Certainly from supporters it did. Even now there's threads on here asking about protests. We haven't even had the bill proposed, or know what it actually says, and if it actually will be proposed. So protesting seems a bit premature. Also people talk about it like we would become Alabama or some really restrictive American state. I could never see that happening. We did thousands of abortions before legalisation. People should just politely write to their MPs and say they want Crisafuli and the party to keep their word. People undervalue writing to your MP. Id expect it to all come back at the next election though so that'll be interesting.
79. Who said I was taken in by one? I commented that Labor did not run a scare campaign. The Katter party was the one who brought it up. If they don’t change great! If they try to change it any point in the next 4 years then it wasn’t a scare campaign.
80. This is what many people are missing. Their are so many people on reddit today absolutely having a melt down about "I can't get an abortion ever now" and one idiot who was like "they'll take away my access to the contraceptive pill" and have absolutely no idea what they were proposing. I'm prochoice up to a certain point. If it's a healthy, viable foetus, and you want an abortion for social reasons, 22 weeks is more than enough time to decide and take action.
81. His word didn't assuage fears. He didn't promise anything. He said it's not his party's plan, and also that if a bill is called up, he will allow conscience votes on it. The fear campaign is valid. The LNP are weak on women's bodily autonomy rights, has many members who have talked at pro life events, and they suck. I will be happy if it doesn't happen. I suspect it may happen under the LNP. It would not have happened at all under labor, no labor MP in Queensland has spoken at pro life rallies. The differences are stark.
82. Possible but I doubt it very much. For a start it is not particularly common for private members bills to pass. Secondly anyone interested in getting reelected will not support it. Labor latched onto a highly emotive topic that the LNP did not put on the policy agenda and kept pushing even after it was made clear that LNP had no intention of changing laws and their leader expressed support for right to choose. The irony is that people started accusing Qld LNP of importing US style conservative politics.
83. It wasn’t even an issue until the LNP members and Katter brought it up! You’ve got it ass backwards.
