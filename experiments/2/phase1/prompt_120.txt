Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. It's true, it's me Mr Hitler alive and totally socialist. You can tell because socialism is in my party name so it must be true. I'm hanging out here in Argentina with Felix Tshisekedi who's the leader of the so very Democratic Republic of Congo and John who owns Crazy Johns Rugs and mobile phones who is, you guessed it, actually crazy. John just killed himself 7 times then drank through a crazy straw just to prove how crazy he is. Got to go, I'm about to have the best pizza in the world at this dive bar, you know it's true because of the sign out the front.
2. Pretty convoluted way to say you didn‚Äôt read what they posted.
3. seems like you don't know the difference between Communism, Marxist-Leninism, and Stalinism.
4. You... Just... Don't... Get... It... Who pushed back against daylight savings, as was the example given?? Who said that it will not be put to Parliament under her leadership? I'm intrigued to know how you think we advanced in the last 10 years... Give me some examples outside of boosting the public service to diddle the employment data. The problem with the left is that you think that you are progressive. Maybe you're progressive when it comes to allowing men to compete in women's sports, but you're certainly not progressive when it comes to development and advancement in economies and quality of life...
5. I wouldn't bother. Just another person who wants to keep the status quo
6. Polite contention. The ALP is not allied with the Greens in any formal sense. Likewise the LNP is not allied with KAP. And the "N" in LNP means "Nationals" as the parties merged on a state basis in Queensland. There might be some policy overlap Venn Diagram style ALP / Green and LNP / KAP but no formal agreement. Everything else you've said I concur with :)
7. Like your opinions, I have got mine. LNP is far from far right. But there‚Äôs no longer left. There‚Äôs just far left. Greens? I don‚Äôt know what they are but they certainly don‚Äôt have best interests of Australia. Just the flag of this country offends them. They speak for Middle East than anybody else at the moment.
8. Yes they have all that but they also have a bunch of things I imagine you don't support like having 16% population of migrants and half of that is from Western countries compared to Australia having 30% of the population as migrants. Or that until 2012 it was a requirement to be a member of the Church of Norway (Lutheran) to sit in parliament. They have a bunch of social policies but they're also a borderline monoculture that takes more white european and european adjacent migrants than anything else, they're extremely protectionist and something like 30% of their economy is in fossil fuels. They're not some paradise of left wing doctrine.
9. Which makes sense, people whose needs are largely looked after don't tend to fuck their lives up by stealing or hurting people.
10. It all goes the same way after some point let‚Äôs be honest dosent matter what side your on with politics we‚Äôre all just getting fucked over by them by the looks of things it won‚Äôt be a big surprise if we‚Äôre about to go round 3 anyway
11. They read the words, they just can't comprehend the concepts.
12. Hahaha, you think the farmer's party is going to enact DST? They're the ones who killed it originally. You seem to think the only progress is grabbing your ankles for rich old men? Mining is becoming automated. The only people who benefit from the LNP agenda are rich businessmen. And if you think trickle down economics works, you're one of these people who enjoys being pissed Oon by them, because that's the only trickle. You're simping for the rich.
13. Oh, I was always under the impression that there were small coalitions with vote flow from the respective parties. I didn‚Äôt assume anything really further than that, just ‚Äúwe give you our votes so you can win easier. And now we have done that we will hound you to put through some of our policies.‚Äù But if it‚Äôs not even a surface level thing then thanks for the correction :)
14. Why would any of that be troublesome? A country has a right to protect its culture. And you‚Äôre complaining about a religious rule changed over a decade ago - that‚Äôs what being progressive means, changing when it makes sense‚Ä¶ Unlike going backwards for no logical reason whatsoever as QLD just did.
15. Wow! Good to see the old tall poppy syndrome is still alive and kicking in QLD. And you think that your attitudes are progressive ü§¶ Maybe I am the rich? ü§∑ I don't know, I just own a business with over 28 staff, which comes with the responsibility of 28 families who need rooves over their heads and food on their tables. Tell me what you think Palacek achieved in her tenure... It's remarkable that you can operate under such delirium! I'll tell you what she achieved. She was able to repetitively lie to QLDers, meanwhile constantly feathering her nest to give herself a nice comfortable exit from state politics at our expense. She bailed and left Steven Miles to carry the can resultant from her inept and dishonest leadership. To Miles' credit, he moved from having the tag of being the least most liked Premier in the country to actually recover from what should have been complete decimation and annihilation at the election. The guy is an arrogant prick, and I have personal experience to draw on to be able to make that statement, but I will also say that he tried his best to stem the hemorrhaging. But he's also a career politician with no real life experience to draw from. If you think that the last 10 years have been progressive, have a look at the results of the three Bellwether electorates in the state, which all changed from Labor to LNP. Townsville, Mackay & Rockhampton. Over three hundred years of collective uninterrupted Labor representation gone. Progression? No, delirium. Save yourself any further angst and just stop kidding yourself. Or is it that you are worried about losing your bum on seat unproductive Public Service job?? Here you go for when you get shown the door: www.seek.com.au Although, how are you going to function in the private sector??? Not well üëÄ
16. Lol, that you think I'm in need of a job or work in the public sector ü§£ But good to see you've admitted you're voting LNP in hopes of becoming rich.
17. Watching the LNP rolling back progressive policies (like pill testing) over the next four years is going to be hard üòû
18. I wouldn't be where I am today (married, with a house) without Labor's drug policy. Regardless of what party you support please support the status quo in terms of drug legislation
19. Alcohol is an extremely dangerous liquid poison, directly linked to many chronic health, societal and crime issues‚Ä¶ Also many politicians like/consume alcohol whilst creating laws making, often far safer and even those with many well documented health benefits (such as Cannabis) ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúillicit‚Äù and criminally punishable. So many people are just stupid (often in an alcoholic stuper) and keep voting for stupid politicians and laws.
20. I just can't help but be disgusted by politicians banning pill testing. Shows a real lack of care for fellow Australians.
21. Just another things to chalk to up outdated ageing fuckers forcing their beliefs on the rest of us...
22. The LNP are typical conservatives, in that they are uninterested in what will save lives, they are more interested in what is "right". They are less interested in evidence based practice and what the experts tell us after studying issues, and more about what their pastor says, or what messages they grew up with. Abortion is a perfect example. We know that illegal abortion causes dead women. It isn't controversial. But it isn't "right" to conservatives so they will oppose legalisation because it is "immoral.", and they accept the deaths and generally blame the woman......"she should have kept her legs closed". (to be fair they would claim that abortion causes dead babies....I disagree that embryonic rights override living women's rights) Drugs are the same. We know how to reduce harm. We have natural experiments all over the world. Some go too far, others not far enough, and we can see the outcomes. They aren't interested in harm reduction though, because it is "immoral" and they think the people who suffer injury or death deserve it. They just shouldn't have used drugs. In the extreme the suffering and deaths also help their position in their mind. They think if people are dying from drugs and abortions then that will be a disincentive to others. So in a lot of cases the harm is the point.
23. Reminder that illegal doesn‚Äôt mean they go away, it means they are uncontrolled by the government and controlled by bikies/gangs and organised crime with only profit in their minds. Legal, would mean controlled by government agencies with safety in their minds. Use your fucking brains.
24. They have no interest in doing what is best or right. They only want control over people. That is their only motive. You can tell by the way they casually dismiss any and every objection and stick with 'we must have control'.
25. I'm 59 , From 16 through to about 35 I used most drugs at different times I've never been unemployed & spent a lot of money on drugs . when they brought drug testing into my workplace I was faced with a choice do drugs & maybe lose my job it's a 150+ a year job .or give the drugs away so I gave up the drugs .best move I ever made . IT takes single mindedness determination & discipline & a burning hatred for what they might have cost you in life. All the best to anyone who reads this & has a crack of getting of the gear.
26. The LNP present humans and very straight forward, rational actors, with no regards to the influence of their environment or conditions. No matter how much scientific study is done on how environment and the social conditions that policies can create influence outcomes, the LNP will always use the simple (and wrong) position of 'personal responsibility'. We are a social species and we impact each other in complex, and complicated ways but it takes 10x longer to messages that then it does to say 'adult crime, adult time,' or any other number of similarly feelings based policies that provide false reassurance. Basically it's the political version of being a flat earther.
27. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-28/act-drug-decriminalisation-one-year-on/104523428?utm_source=abc_news_app&utm_medium=content_shared&utm_campaign=abc_news_app&utm_content=other came across this earlier and thought it was an interesting contrast
28. The LNP probably isn't going to go that much harder on possession charges. They'll probably go harder on supply charges. Everyone thinks the Labor government introduced drug warnings and further diversions for the sake of "health." But the reality is that it was clogging the court system. And people were getting no conviction tmrecorded with a fine that got referred to sper. And the fine was minuscule. The LNP isn't going to re-clog up the court system for the sake of some fines that will never get paid.
29. I'll be so mad if they take away things like the naloxone program.... that and fentanyl testing has literally saved my life in the last couple of years...
30. I would prefer an approach where we maintain pill testing in some form but then come down with an iron fist on drug dealers, lock them away and throw away the keys.
31. Nothing wrong with a bit of weed but yeh, I'd like to see tougher penalties for meth and other drugs. Sick of them all around here. The moment they go without they become violent destructive pieces of shit. I'd also like to see alcohol banned outright too.
32. So what's actually going to happen is prices will go up because events like this and music festivals will have to have on site medical support which will drive people away from these events so they will try drugs in less supervised areas resultING in more death and disability
33. These drugs are illegal, and therefore are unknown in quality and content. They are consumed recreationally. If you knowingly put something unknown and potentially lethal into your system for the purposes of recreation, then you deserve a Darwin award. That goes for my kids too. You stick unknown shit in your system, you wear the consequences for your actions. Taking that crap is not compulsory.
34. i can go out and buy enough alcohol right now to kill myself but sure, drugs are bad
35. I agree drug laws need to change but what's the best way to go about it?if we were to legalise soft drugs like shrooms or weed, then people would ask, well why don't we go one step further to lsd and ecstacy? And then u could make a argument of legalizing cocaine and so on. When do we reach a level of safe, or what drug would be considered safe? To add, getting rid of pill testing is fucking stupid. I would say a start is changing how weed is read in a rbt/ rdt reading. Maybe in a similar way to how alcohol is read. Charging someone because they still have a small amount of thc in their system from smoking a joint 12 hours ago is fucking stupid, especially if they aren't showing signs of being high
36. People are free to purchase their own pill testing kits?
37. I don't understand how pill testing is supposed to make taking illicit drugs any safer. These substances are illegal because experts have proven that they harm the individual and people around them. Wouldn't encouraging teens to not take the risk in the first place be a more effective way to reduce drug related deaths?
38. It's good for the rest of the country, sometimes we dont need to jump off a cliff when our friends do. We just need to watch them , sit back and say yeah... that was stupid and go on with our lives. Queensland Electing the LNP is a good lesson for the rest of Australia. Like watching your friend put a fork in a plug socket, rather him then me.
39. Did you sell drugs to help you buy a house? J/K I knew what you meant. I can imagine a few people might be tempted by that career with current house prices.
40. Overtime work + sleep deprivation are also a large killer. We should ban that
41. You‚Äôre sorely mistaken if you don‚Äôt believe young people aren‚Äôt a fan of junkies either.
42. Errrrrrr the State just voted for the LNP, bit late for that‚Ä¶
43. People selling potentially deadly drugs like caffeine deserve the death penalty
44. I agree. Dangerous drug pushers - like those manufacturing, advertising and selling alcohol - should be locked away and have the keys thrown away.
45. Why should my tax dollars go towards a public health care system I don‚Äôt use? If tax dollars went where we wanted them instead of where they were needed we‚Äôd be a third world country. These programs are also not tax payer funded (not all of them anyway). They are funded through a variety of methods, some of those being rates (similar to taxes but better than going into some BCC executives pocket), proceeds of crime and private funding. I agree dealers should face lockup, but insinuating that it is simply okay for end users to just ‚Äòdie‚Äô and hopefully use them as an example for a wake up call is just abhorrent. There‚Äôs a difference between recreational usage and straight up drug addiction. This would also divert tax dollars from federally funded prisons as it would negate the petty possession charges that some face.
46. I‚Äôm against legalisation purely because I think it opens doors for issues further down the track. Moreso i believe it would add a blur to an already non-straightforward system. Decriminalisation and legalisation are seperate things which many people do forget, rightfully so. Legalisation would bring regulation, control and TAX (the primary thing a governing body cares about). Legalisation brings a slurry of problems, all of which I am not educated enough or qualified to comment on. The one point I will make about legalisation is that I believe it opens the door for criminals and over seas syndicates to capitalise on a ‚Äòlegal‚Äô market which introduces problems like LA has seen with counterfeit THC carts. Decriminalisation on the other hand for most (ice and Heroin can rot in hell) substances would on paper be a plausible and possibly good idea. It removes strain on the courts system for people found with small amounts of RECREATIONAL drugs ( a quantity only suitable for 1 person). My case and point for this is the horrifying amount of hospitalisations caused by young people at their first festival per se, seeing police with dogs (very common at NSW events), and panick swallowing all of their drugs to avoid prosecution. Decriminalisation eliminates some of that risk and instead invites education and diversion. The point you make about when do we reach a level of ‚Äúsafe‚Äù is actually an excellent argument as well. I don‚Äôt think drugs whether it be alcohol, weed, nicotine or cocaine will ever reach a level of ‚Äúsafe‚Äù regardless of what anyone does, says or thinks. However, I do believe that we can get to a point that is ‚Äòsafer‚Äô. Harm reduction, education and diversion are the keys here. Again I am not qualified to comment on this and have no idea what works for anyone but me. I‚Äôll stop my little ramble there, but Thankyou very much for your reply. Extremely insightful with some very valid arguments and points.
47. "The contaminated water kills people, not the lack of water testing." "The faulty wiring causes fires, not the absence of inspections." ...
48. If the drugs were legal, they‚Äôd have quality controls in place. Much like how alcohol is quality controlled, and with exception to a ‚Äúpoison‚Äù logo - labelled.
49. But if the testing revealed laced drugs, they wouldn‚Äôt take them, and they would live. How do you think your argument makes any sense? It‚Äôs dumbfounding to me.
50. Whilst agree the laced pills are what kills, you realise that removing the testing facilities then destroys any chance of those pills being discarded instead of consumed. Laced pills kill people but if you remove the testing facilities introduced to stop this from happening the blame then squarely falls on the LNP. If the testing centre is still there and it happens then the blame is up for interpretation. If it‚Äôs not, the blame for that death falls squarely on the LNP and no one else. By removing the facility they are then liable for 100% of a blame to be given.
51. Those are illegal under existing law. They're considered drug paraphernalia. So, no, people aren't free to purchase their own.
52. A very narrow minded response to what is a very important and broad debate.
53. Some recreational drugs are relatively safe as long as a safe dose is taken of the pure drug. Ecstasy, eg, was invented for use by marriage therapists. Unfortunately making drugs illegal has introduced the criminal element and encouraged maximum profits. To this end a dealer will often cut very expensive pure drugs with an inexpensive filler and then press the result into convincing-looking pills. The filler might be something Inert like sugar or bicarb soda but it could also be something dangerous. What's more the dealer can only believe his supplier that the 'pure' drug he just bought is what it was claimed to be. Testing pills lets teenagers be confident that what they have is at least not deadly.
54. Your statement is simply untrue - the illegality surrounding many drugs (marijuana, ecstasy and LSD) were criminalised for industry and political reasons. Ecstasy started out as a therapeutic drug used in controlled doses as part of a therapeutic treatment. LSD was also used as a therapeutic drug and statistically had a significant success rate in treating alcoholism. There has not been a significant body of research regarding either drug suggesting they are harmful in and of themselves if used correctly. There is also only a limited amount of credible research regarding marijuana that suggests the primary risk is causing an earlier onset of schizophrenia in males with a genetic disposition. It‚Äôs about control and has nothing to do with genuine risks - if that were the case we wouldn‚Äôt have alcohol or tobacco (or sugar, fats, etc). I could go on ‚Ä¶
55. I understand your point here, however educating teens on the dangers of these illicit substances is obviously not 100% effective, and for one reason or another some people **will** take drugs. Whether you like it or not, it is important to understand that these people have reasons for abusing illicit substances and it is important to be able to **ensure their wellbeing**. For the people that do decide to consume illicit substances, the fatalities and hospitalizations that occur can be significantly reduced by providing these anonymous pill testing services (laced pills can be detected, outbreaks of potent drugs can be more safely dealt with). The pill testing is only a component of their service, which is a consultation with a nurse about the risks of abusing illicit substances also offering mental health advice. From harm-reduction point of view, these services result in great outcomes, decreasing the amount of unintentional and even negligent overdoses (accounting for the majority of drug related fatalities) as well as establishing a line of communication about drug use and other personal issues without its stigmatization (encouraging safety and responsibility among users). It also reduces the strain on the healthcare system, decreasing the admittances for drug related incidents as it is (like education) a preventative measure. Overall, pill testing is a greatly valuable harm reduction strategy, providing necessary information, promoting responsible use, and reducing the risks associated with substance consumption. Its a practical service, accepting that drug abuse **will** exist, addressing drug-related harm in society, leading to better health outcomes and a reduction in fatalities. At the end of the day, these benefits, the saved lives, demands that we ought to keep this service from a moral and possibly economic standpoint.
56. Well I‚Äôm glad that the impending misfortune of millions of people in our state is a ‚Äúgood lesson‚Äù for yours. Read the room mate.
57. üíØ. We should get the unions onto it. Oh‚Ä¶ wait‚Ä¶ they probably won‚Äôt have much clout at the moment.
58. We already get taxed a fuckload for working crazy hours a week we cant just ban it! It's one or the other!
59. >Grow up Being an asshole isn't growing up. >if you're a junkie take it at your own risk Only a small amount of people who use drugs are junkies. >why must the government safe guard the use of drugs They are making it illegal to safeguard not the same thing at all. They were not the ones doing the pill testing.
60. Young people _usually_ prefer science to scaremongering. Not all young people obviously as you seem to be one of the few who are more similar to our ageing cohort. Edit: typo going-young
61. Your use of the word junkie here is pretty disgusting. Kids leaving school and consuming ecstasy is a reality that thousands of people experience every year. It's experimentation and is completely normal really. Far from 'junkie'. Even labelling drug users as junkies is abhorrent. You have no idea what people lives have been that have resulted in them either consuming drugs recreationally or as an addiction.
62. Alcohol is a terrible drug. It‚Äôs responsible for so many bad things that happen in people‚Äôs lives. It is an absolute drainer on our healthcare system and can ruin alcohol abusers and their families & friends lives. Watching an alcoholic slowly fade away is one of the hardest things you can ever see!
63. Why do you care about the legality if you‚Äôre taking illegal drugs? This is a smooth brain argument
64. The Greens are presently feeding homeless people in their electorates partially funded out of their parliamentary salary, so the Greens do take the initiative.
65. How is there a debate? There is a result. Aussies don‚Äôt sook. We get on with the job.
66. Thank you for explaining. But, if we are testing the pills, hasn't the drug dealer already been paid? If the pill has been tested, we've saved a life - which is always a good outcome, but we haven't been able to stop the purchase of illegal and obviously dangerous synthetic drugs. If teens were more hesitant to buy in the first place because of the evident risks you've pointed out, it would stop drug dealers from getting rich.
67. I didn't know that so many people were taking MDMA and LSD as part of therapeutic treatments at parties and festivals (some maybe, but it would be a stretch to say most). They have been dubbed recreational for a reason I suppose. Isn't the claim that it's all about control just as unprovable a statement as my original one that these drugs are unsafe?
