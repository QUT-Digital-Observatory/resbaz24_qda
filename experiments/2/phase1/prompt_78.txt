Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. People are angry (especially in rural non Brisbane city areas) because youth crime has been getting screamed as an issue (Townsville and Cairns especially) for a long time and labor sat on it until 12 months before the election. What labor is doing now may be working but I know there’s a lot of people saying too little too late. On issues other than youth crime, Labor have focused on Brisbane city with cheap fares, turning their backs on mining and farming communities and focusing the Olympics. Regional are very disenfranchised and I will be surprised if labor win many seats outside the city where labor’s focus has the most benefits.
2. Exactly. Why would you want a new Prime Minister every month and constant squabbling like it used to be.
3. 👆👆👆 You got it. BTW it's Labor. We have the silly American spelling lmao
4. Why is it blue or red? Why not green or another independent? Look at the US with their black and white parties: you're either with us or you're the enemy. I vote for independents or minor parties because I'm entirely disenfranchised by the two majors. I sure as shit don't agree with a single LNP policy but Labor doesn't really give a shit beyond the basics either.
5. Sorry dude but if you're not going to take the democratic process seriously yourself then it's a bit rich to start making claims about the way anyone else votes. Your vote is an important thing and there are marked differences between the major parties. For example, the LNP are very clear that they want to reduce mining royalties--essentially a tax cut for mining companies.Labor want to continue to tax them as they are currently doing and rightly so because the resources they take from the land belong to Queenslanders and those royalties go into funding useful stuff like 50c fares, free school lunches etc
6. Some of the independents running are even more cooked than the LNP
7. Don’t buy into the “both parties are shit” narrative. It’s pure ignorance and smug cynicism.
8. Australia is 20 to 30 years behind the USA on a lot of our ideas and policies We can see what's happening over there right now, in real time. We have a chance to change the path we're on and vote these fascist picks in to oblivion. A vote for LNP is a vote for trumpism. Pure and simple.
9. People are lazy and fall into habits or do what their parents did. The average person doesn't take any time out of their day to look at what policies parties are pushing and just take what is fed to them by the news, almost every major media outlet is an LNP shill, hence why they default into voting for LNP.
10. Honestly you're probably not too far from the truth. It seems that both big party leaders here in Queensland seem to be just as bad as each other. I have resorted to voting for independents as my first preference in recent years, as I feel the big parties no longer stand for the values they once did. Although in saying that, in very simple terms LNP and ALP have some difference. I'll probably cop some hate for this, but I couldn't care less. ALP for the most part tend to spend a lot of money on welfare, public transport, education... which in the short term makes people happy. The problem with spending lots of money, is that it will eventually come back to bite the taxpayers in the long run. In that if you spend lots of money (sometimes money you don't have), you will have to pay it back eventually. But as a benefit they do make life a little easier for people, leaning on the side of a bigger government body, more progressive social/moral stances and tend to have a bit more of a globalist perspective on the world in recent times. LNP on the other hand tend to be more conservative in the ways they do things, both economically and at times morally/socially. They are normally economically conservative, so they put limits on public spending, to reduce government debt. This normally comes in the form of privatisation, tax reforms and focus on big business and high income earners as a way to increase jobs and investors. The LNP also believes in smaller government, which is why you'll see them closing down parts of government or public sectors that they don't see as beneficial or rather more beneficial as private sector industries. Their policies usually reflect a push against long term reliance on government, so you'll see policies about self reliance rather than government dependance. Morally/socially they tend to align more for religious Christians or general conservatives, this their push for abortion policies. Protection for faith based schools... So in essence, ALP benefit in the short term, but do damage to the economy in the long run unfortunately. LNP will be seen to be making life harder in the short term, but arguably more beneficial in the long run. Obviously there are differences on both sides, something like negative gearing from ALP I would argue is a conservative economic reform. Strangely the LNP is not in support of it seems. I think this is definitely seen more on a federal level then a state level. State level can be hard to gauge or see how this occurs sometimes. But as people have been aware of lately, things are coming out especially things about abortion, youth crime, housing...
11. It’s not just old males. Some of the most staunch life long LNP voters are women, and Qld is full of them. They think that a Sky news opinion jockey (aka Tony Abbots former advisor) “should be running the country” as they sit back on the deck of their 3 million dollar house that their estranged adult children have never visited.
12. Can you elaborate? What choice are they planning on taking away from women?
13. Gotta be honest, you don't don't sound like a swing voter in the comments. Maybe you swing between ALP and greens or something but you seem to have a distaste for LNP (THIS IS NOT A BAD THING) LNP are ass which is why I'm not a swing voter (maybe I'll vote independent sometimes). To the question, people in desperation as the commenter hinted their community may be aren't voting on policies. They are probably pissed off at the lack of visibility of their issues and the fact nothing has been done. It doesn't matter if LNP are better or worse the important thing is not voting for the people who aren't helping you. To be completely honest I would do the same thing. I wouldn't vote for a party that had neglected my region and people for years. But I still wouldn't vote LNP lol.
14. I got LNP's flyer in the mail today, "Adult Time for Adult Crimes!" splashed across it. I looked into it and they don't seem to have any actual plan aside from, "let's throw kids in jail". It's all just dog whistles and fear-mongering to appeal to their base. What about cost of living? Rental crisis? Housing affordability? Colesworth price gouging? *crickets*
15. Youth criminals don't steal AMGs and bmws to put food on the table lol
16. Dutton's been awfully quiet on this because people started to talk about the fact that he has a freakin $400-MILLION property and childcare portfolio. Dutton, the former cop, who mysteriously still won't tell us why he had to leave the police force. I don't trust him as far as I can throw him.
17. Mate if that's your opinion then that fine but i think you are being very disingenuous with this post. If you don't want to go to their website or facebook or courier mail comments section then you're not actually looking for an answer to your question you just want to validate your existing beliefs. Youth crime is a perfect example. Reddit will just tell you it is all scare tactics and about locking up kids however the actual plan includes prevention and rehabilitation programs that would be very helpful in regional areas. Do I believe they actually have a detailed and costed rehabilitation plan for youth criminals? NO. Is it something that on paper would help the community and would make someone vote for him? YES.
18. Its actually not a bad idea for OP, if they are genuinely seeking an alternative perspective. People really shouldn't be against that either, it should be self-evident (and I believe that it is self-evident) that Labor is the right choice. Listening to other people who genuinely have a case for the LNP shouldn't change that, it should strengthen your position - or maybe you aren't as confident in it as you think you are.
19. That is an interesting story. Do you think its true? Are Labor objectively the bastions of truth, justice and all that is good while the other are Marvel-movie villains out to get us? Or might that be just a minor simplification on your part in order to make life easier on yourself? Maybe, just maybe, parties could be right on some things, and wrong on others.
20. So given it's a foregone conclusion that they'll win, you're saying you're going to continue being a cunt. Great...
21. Considering the size of their recorded profits, and that we’re only taxing at 25% I feel like that well is far from dry from dry hole. But I totally see your point.
22. Borrowing for infrastructure is good. You end up with an asset worth more than the borrowings. Borrowing for tax cuts is bad. You end up with no asset and an inflationary environment.
23. \> The answer to every election cant be 'everyone else but me is stupid' Figure 1.
24. >Come Saturday night, it'll be a meltdown in here. Yep it's gonna be a shit-show and I can't wait.
25. Nope not at all I dont think it has a pro-labor bias at all.
26. Regardless of who you support - youth crime is a major issue. Police closing cases based on pressuring individuals to do so as not to impact their solved cases and general crime occurrence in an area is the reason numbers often look better than they are. They have KPIs to hit as well - and much like a sales role they’re always expected to be better than the previous year. Youth crime is happening more. The general population isn’t crazy in assuming so.
27. If a conscience vote were to happen, which would be the worst case scenario, it would easily be defeated. For abortion laws to be repealed in Queensland it would require an ultra conservative MP to go rogue and everyone from the major parties to secretly agree with and support them on something that is deeply unpopular in the community and politically untenable The reality is abortion is not part of any major party platform in Queensland and the majority of MPs from Libs/Labor are moderate on the issue and have no desire for change to the legislation
28. What policies mate? The only policies are Fuck Children, Fuck Women's rights, Fuck the first nations people and line the pockets of their biggest donators. Literally, that's what it boils down to. There is nothing else outside of what is "standard operating practice' of a sitting government. Seriously, enlighten us. Because not a single "LNP" Stan has been able to articulate a researched and factual response. Not a singe one. Go for it... we are waiting
29. People are unaware. They are LNP and don't know what they are voting for. Best method is to tell friends and family.
30. We only knew Anastasia and what she did not Steven and Cambell Newwnan was long ago and David maybe will be different from then ..Time will tell as they all lie!!
31. I grew up in NorthWest Queensland and now live in Brisbane. You always here about the south east bubble and how people in Brisbane think the state ends at Gympie. Moving here, i was shocked at just how true that is, and this sub is a great example of that insualted thinking. I have had people on this sub argue that the problems people in Cairns and Townsville are facing are not relevent to state politics because they are a minority of the population. Its crazy.
32. I’m going to take a drink every time I read the phrase “echo chamber” for the next 36 hours lol.
33. You could make a case for this sub being more pro Green than Pro Labor. Ultimately it's a left wing and an anti conservative subreddit. There is no balance. Imagine how fucked the world would be if we left subreddit's govern society
34. Its crazy... I have been keeping an eye on it, and the bias is remarkable.
35. Can you please provide some examples for your claims? Could you also explain while during John Howards terms the government had multiple surplus budgets and essentially got the Australian economy down to very little debt?
36. Agreed. Once I saw that Amanda Stoker was running and will likely be elected, I knew that no good was going to happen. I honestly don't know why I'm being downvoted as I said that I voted for the ALP. I'd never vote for the LNP. I'll admit I'm more of a teal voter but I do not want ~~Crisafulli~~ Bleijie running the state.
37. Yep, LCQ #1 for me! Hoping they get enough votes for the major parties to take notice
38. This is what I'm after thank you for you views. How do you think liberal would do better in that situation tho? As for youth crime I thought I saw a study that said youth crime was going down (it may have been for another state so I could be wrong here) I personally hate the phrase adult time adult crime, it seems like such a cop out. How effective is jail for adults? We should be investing time and effort into why these kids are acting out and dealing with it instead of throwing them in a box and starting the cycle of repeat offenders early.
39. From a disillusioned moderate voter, I appreciate your detailed write up. There are elements that both parties do better in but neither party will excel by itself in all that is required and both parties are ultimately beholden to their corporate interests.
40. Union stop work days are 4x that of Victoria. Ok. Why are they stopping? What are they saying? What are the differences between here and Vic?. That stat is pretty meaningless without context. You have just used "higher number bad" and continued on. This is an area I don't know much about so I'm genuinely asking those questions and not just being a dick.
41. Yeah. I liked him and his mob. Rex Patrick posts a lot of stuff about integrity in parliament which is great reading.
42. Doesn’t really matter preferential voting means your vote goes to whoever you put second last anyways
43. I don’t disagree with this, good to see primary’s not going to the majors cause they are really taking it for granted that there are only really 2 parties to vote for
44. This is how I voted. It hurt for me to put LNP third, but I sure as hell wasn’t risking the BSCC’s accidentally getting in.
45. If the KAP has the deciding votes then we are going to hell in a hand basket. We may even see a push for a new state; Northeast Australia.
46. Imagine Katter with some power and what it means for society. The guy is unstable.
47. I think that is possibly the worst outcome for the state because the LNP will have to bend over backwards to keep KAP/ON happy. They will have to do all sorts of batshit crazy to hold together that alliance (though it may mean going back to the polls early when it all falls apart which would be a plus)
48. Internal polling claims to show KAP doing well in two NQ seats and ON in one CQ seat. If the regional swing is uneven, we might be looking at an LNP-KAP-ON minority government.
49. Hasn't Crisafulli stated there wouldn't be a LNP minority government, i.e. he'd leave it to Labor to try to govern a coalition? (Sorry for the paywall: https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/politics/queensland/crisafulli-categorically-rules-out-leading-a-minority-government-20241025-p5klfx.html )
50. Labour is heavily funded by the union movement. Everyone has a motivation to influence politicians the LNP is not on its own for receiving money for which someone wants something in exchange for.
51. It's the Australian values of fair play. We see everything in terms of sport, and if QLD won the State of Origin every year, even the most die-hard would root for the cockroaches. Unfortunately unlike sport, there are very frightening real world consequences for this mindset in politics.
52. I'm sure the "time for a change" mindset is astroturfed. If it was genuine, the LNP would not have held Brisbane City Council for 24 effin' years.
53. That's a big part of it I agree. *"Give the other side a go!"*
54. This is exactly my mother when it comes to voting and she is 85.
55. Yeah policy matters, I normally vote for whichever doesn’t smear campaign the other party, bc clearly they don’t have enough going for their own policy to get them through. Have strong policy, take it to the election, follow through, come up with more good policies.
56. THIS, & also, Steven Miles wasn’t voted in & he can fuck right off!!
57. Yet crime is at an all time low ,go figure .
58. Re youth crime. The liberal loving media have been beating up this issue all year they use against labour. A simple google search will show that youth crime numbers are DOWN. Not saying there is no issue but it is not a runaway problem that they are claiming
59. Live in regional Qld......I am hearing about youth crime consistently .......I have lived here 8 years, don't lock the shed or garage, occasionally lock the house......youth crime isn't really an issue here
60. Yup. Hawke's The Accord was both the best and worst thing to happen. People finally got a lot of what unions had campaigned for decades, but at the cost of curtailing their rights to protest and directly get involved. As well, the neoliberal economic policies as you state really did dismantle a lot of solid social bonds in society built up with the original Labor party, and the post-WWII welfare system and union power. It was a hollowing out of the party and society itself to private interests. Then again you read Gough Whitlam's book on his time as PM and within Labor in the 60s he's describing all the same party politics BS as now, unfortunately there are a lot of people who are content with either the status quo being bad, or on using the political system to further their career rather than do anything useful. This creates apathy in voters when these people get into power and seemingly do sweet FA in terms of policies. We also have Murdoch who has a stranglehold on media in this country, and in his reducing every media outlet to nothing better than a gossip rag, politicians are paralysed from having real ideas or speaking with any confidence in their visions otherwise they are pilloried because Murdoch naturally is deeply rightwing. I really like Miles though, what a breath of fresh air to have a guy just be upfront about doing shit that matters like public transport fares, power bill rate cuts, or free school lunches. He's in the unenviable position but in a way that's emboldened him to give less of a toss about all the circus demanded by the media and the wider political system to conform to a hollowed out agenda of chipping at the sides.
61. Dude the offer for that hug still stands if you need it
62. Conservatives don't need to run on facts or positive anything. All they need to do now is say "these people are the devil" and all the little right wing freaks will gobble it up.
63. And I understand rural and regional areas are angry, I left northern Queensland for a better quality of life , less racism, less conservatism, and more opportunities . Unfortunately people aren’t as attracted to work in regional and rural areas which in turn decreases service capacity and snowballs the problem.
64. “… until 12 months before the election…”?? You mean around the time Miles became premier? All these idiots saying ‘we need a change’ … you’ve just bloody well had one!!! Give the guy a chance to show what he can do first! It’ll be disastrous to have LNP in power, who will undo all the good, and set us back 50 years (or more!!!)
65. Youth crime is in a downward trend and significant areas that don’t have access to the number of healthcare and early intervention services, proving that those strategies work. LNP will never focus on regional areas . Labour has increased funding to support people in regional areas access central healthcare services through transport, accommodation subsidy, Telehealth, and incentives to attract staff . LNP would slash a lot of that https://www.qao.qld.gov.au/reports-resources/reports-parliament/reducing-serious-youth-crime#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20young%20people,to%2010%2C304%20in%202021–22.
66. > What labor is doing now may be working but I know there’s a lot of people saying too little too late. So those people think voting LNP is going to improve things? *"Hey this may be working, but I'm marginally unhappy with how it went so let's vote for the party who will definitely make it worse"*. > turning their backs on mining and farming communities This is just untrue. The previous LNP government gutted the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and has tried to block state ownership of energy infrastructure which would employ tens of thousands of Queenslanders in long-term, reliable, well-paying *careers*, so that they can sell public owned assets to their mates and international companies that would suppress local job creation, undercut existing workforces, and ship profits overseas. Work a physical job? The LNP have tried to prevent Labour from strengthening workplace protections. They hate workers. They hate hi-vis. Work in manufacturing? Get ready for the LNP to send your job overseas. Work in mining? Get ready to have less safe, less secure, lower-paying jobs available because the LNP only care about mining to the extent that it makes *them* rich. And when the mining jobs start disappearing because the LNP sold all of our infrastructure, land, ports etc to overseas companies to line their own pockets and the rest of the world has moved on from buying so much of what we dig out of the ground, you can fight over the scraps of whatever other rural jobs exist, because the LNP will have cancelled Labour's long-term plan for a statewide energy infrastructure that employs tens of thousands in the regions and *prints money for Queenslanders*. Work farming? Get ready to have more pests, because the LNP hate science and bioprotection. More drought because they don't believe in climate change mitigation (or just don't care), and think essential public resources like water should belong to whoever can afford to bribe them. And when there are more bushfires and floods, Crisafulli will make you pay for the disaster relief that now costs more because they gutted the authorities that would have prepared us for them. The LNP hate regular people. We're cattle to them. They care about what they can extract from you, that's it.
67. Especially with the preferential voting system we have! Even if you vote greens or an independent 1, if they don't win your vote can still go to your preference between Labor and Liberal.
68. Because realistically it’s either going to be the ALP or the LNP forming government this time around, and probably the next time too. The only party that might disrupt that dynamic are the Greens, and they’re still not achieving critical mass because for every good policy they have, they do something that puts off most of the electorate. Independents are fine, vote for them if you wish - but lots of them are almost single-issue focused and a coalition of independents will inevitably form a party to hold power.
69. ALP can get away with does less good, because LNP is so bad. I would love to have a strong LNP with credible alternative policies, to keep labor on its toe. I shouldn't have to choose between poor public transport outside Brisbane and religious nuts.
70. In that case you'll need to think how to number rest of the boxes carefully, because your vote will go to the first viable option down the list, if the smaller parties and independents don't get over the line.
71. This. And say what you want about Miles but most politicians are too scared to rock the boat too much as it often doesn't bode well for them (see carbon tax). Whether you agree with him or not, you don't see this leadership style in the majors very often.
72. The Labor party is always compromised, occasionally incompetent, and perpetually disappointing to it's true believers. The modern Liberal party exists to transfer public money into private hands. To ensure that the poors don't get more than they deserve, and to ensure that the scrabbling masses remain right where they are. There is a vast difference. If you are a wagey, or on benefits, a student or a woman don't vote Liberal/LNP. They will screw you so hard.
