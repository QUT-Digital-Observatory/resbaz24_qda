Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Mining royalties - the coal lobbies put huge sums of money into the LNP to get rid of them Crime - Labor were too quiet about it in their campaign I think. Steven Miles could have used the opportunity as a new premier (like he did with the cost of living package, the 50c fares and the free school lunches) to turn up the heat on this against the LNP and promote an alternative solution instead of simply diverting attention to how shoddy the LNP’s plan is and pointing out stats. That just gave the LNP free rein to campaign hard on that one issue.
2. To protect their own assets and fk everyone else. A lot of people flip flop once they've gained wealth.
3. Yes, Labor in Qld used to be less progressive, so it makes sense their right wing dropped off
4. Not a scab mate, he’s done more time sitting on the grass than you’ve had hot dinners, as have I. I bet the CCC don’t have your happy snaps on their wall.
5. Sure, but imagine having enough empathy to understand someone being pissed because a government wouldn't let them see a relative they loved as they were dying. People are allowed to have different views about the world.
6. maybe I'm interrpurting it differently seems like that how most of the people have read it lol
7. Just to clarify, the community don't want Stage 4 scrapped. We want the current route for Stage 4 to be realigned. There are routes which the community have now presented which instead of taking out houses, shops, schools and farmland will go through forestry and unfarmable spaces.
8. You've literally posted that 4 times now in this thread, are LNP paying you or do you just seriously care this much about a sex offender registry to bring it up in a thread that is barely relevant to it?
9. Mmm yes, a sex offender registry from the party who famously protected a known rapist and big chungus.
10. Nah, they're pretty happy to stick to the majors, and some are 1st and 2nd generation immigrant families (came with wealth though), so ON doesn't appeal. FF are a joke party, I don't think they take them seriously.
11. You are not wrong. Nuclear takes him away from the energy concerns that he deals with, hence the lack of engagement with you. Personally, nuclear makes too much sense. We should of had it for years.
12. It amazes me when public sector workers expect the LNP to ever do more than the bare-minimum when it comes to supporting the public sector. They'd sell the schools if they could get away with it.
13. I think it open to the public. this was qtu election journal https://www.qtu.asn.au/3d/2024StateElection/index.html
14. My theory on that election is that people didn't want more change, and the government at the time was decent enough, clearly cared about science and public health
15. That doesn’t really matter in reference to what I just said, no one is looking at historical evidence or even evidence this time will be better, what people know is that ALP has been in power the last 3 terms and have stopped servicing their needs or wants so they want a change. It’s easy to say right side bad left side good or vice versa because that serves the “values” you’ve aligned yourself with but clearly the majority don’t agree with you and want a change. And also a good amount of people obviously have switched from left to right since the ALP has been in majority power for so long, which should be a good indicator people aren’t happy with ALP and want change.
16. Point taken but I don't think it's necessarily people think that harsher laws would reduce crime. I think people think harsher punishments are more just and equitable in terms of consequences for the crime committed, regardless of whether that would discourage future crimes. People are sick of crimes committed but the punishment is not perceived to be commensurate with the extent of the crime committed.
17. People don't want harsher sentences because they think it will "sort out" the scruffs who are already doomed. They want harsher sentences so that they can't commit a crime and be out committing more crimes the next day laughing about it. Rehabilitation doesn't work in it's current format, but if they are inside, at least they aren't out being little shitcunts making life miserable for normal people.
18. Kids should be fed by parents who provide pack lunches, like we do. If kids are going without lunch, it’s not because their parents don’t have the money to provide it, it’s just that they prefer to spend the money on things like smokes and alcohol, and can’t be arsed to make it. As someone with two kids, a sandwich and apple costs next to nothing.
19. Say it with me now. Two. Billion. Dollars. There are a whole lot of things that we’d do in an ideal world. But stuff costs, you know, money. Of which there is not an endless supply.
20. So most of the world has it wrong with their tough sentencing? And we are right being soft?
21. If they are going to jail they are already criminals.
22. Average person doesn't even know who their local member is let alone difference between state and federal governments. I suspect federal labour is also going to have a hard time winning the next elections and from my point of view when I see [shit like this](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-05/gas-giant-australia-prepares-to-import-gas-as-shortage-looms/104303824) it makes me question what are they actually doing?
23. Housing is a state responsibility, not federal. Labor could have, I don't know, stuck to any of their various housing policies they kept introducing to placate the masses. Why didn't Labor do anything at all about overhauling the public housing system? Why didn't they house people in order of wait time and need? Why do we have people on the waitlist for *multiple decades*. Why didn't they actually get rid of no grounds evictions for renters? We still have them when a fixed term expires. Why didn't they tie rent increases to CPI, like was done federally with NRAS, to stop people being priced into homelessness? These are responsibilities of states. I didn't vote LNP but I can see why there were so many protest votes. School fruit and a bit of electricity doesn't matter if you have nowhere to live.
24. I am not sure this was actually meant to be a response to my post as it doesn't really seem relevant to what I said. But public housing is the worst...... in short - governments suck at building homes and providing the array of options that the market wants. Public housing = more expensive homes that don't suit the buyer as well. Refer to East Germany.
25. Is it normal for ALP voters to downvote anyone who doesn't agree with their views? Not spiteful at all. 🤣👍
26. Not sure. I feel silly to have to explain to you that I joked. I voted LNP because Labour is taking us down the wrong path. 7/10 people didn't prefer them, so that should not be a surprise to you or anyone.
27. Fkn helllll. So yous had a good gov that took responsibility and that wasn’t good enough? The abortion bill etc seems to be a hot topic atm, what else are they tryna pass? I’m actually moving to Australia on Tuesday, arriving Wednesday lol (only whv tho so shouldn’t impact me much) Many thanks!!!
28. Their voting base benefits from projects being completed and more people moving here. The scarcity will never be caught up now.
29. You clearly have no understanding of the issue. When unions push for 250k jobs flipping lollipops, all the residential builders leave the residential building sector for union jobs. This drives up the price of building, on top of everything else impacting the cost of building, and living.
30. Your second sentence showed why the unions are at fault, the developer takes on all the risk. The unions slow the build. Of course the developer should get the majority of the profits. Which is why they are all back to forming their own construction arms. Unions are there to keep workers safe and ensure fair pay, not to control the projects. They have bitten the hand that feeds them too many times. The Labor policies also slowed any development.
31. That's the thing about echo chambers. Opposing viewpoints don't have a lot of reason to want to give that opinion in fear of whatever retribution might come their way, be it down votes, or ridicule, both of which being the most likely outcome here. Is a lose/lose. Evidence by anyone actually voicing a legitimate reason in this thread.
32. You’d be here all day as to why. Everyone has a different reason.
33. It is strikingly similar to Crisafulli‘s approach to answering questions.
34. As someone who works in the healthcare industry and was recently accused by my colleagues of "caring too much" I would like to think Im considerate and passionate about people other than myself. I am also quite proud to think of the many Australians whose quality of life has been improved by work. Abortion policies are understandably a hot topic and its easy to see why people on both sides are passionate themselves about the issue. Which speaks to why I have discontent over the fear campaign of the policies which parties stated they had no intentions to change. Robbie Katter is a good example, to my understanding he stated that while his party members had strong views on the matter they had no intention of raising a bill; with the only people to raise the topic during the election campaign being the media themselves repeatedly. I saw this as journalists, specifically in the ABC, imposing their views to swing voters to their personal preferences. I would say you should be careful of things such as this. I suspect that while we may share the same views on this policy, you were swayed by what I saw as a scare campaign.
35. That's the point, they appeal to the phantasm of "the good ol days" which never really even existed
36. It encourages fresh ideas from labour too. The same party perpetually in power is a bad outcome for multiple ratings.
37. Don't say a bad word about unions and you'll be voted down.
38. I'm not supporting this person's point but I don't think property prices in the US and UK grew anywhere near as dramatically as here and NZ, shouldn't be including those.
39. You are missing the point. It doesnt matter as much as to who causes it, it is who is in power when it happens. This is how most voting is done.
40. What's really scary is that sometimes if the incumbent side unexpectedly pulls out last minute, or has a big scandal revealed or whatever... these people sometimes win.
41. A lot of LNP people seem to be Facebook community page admins. My local page is managed by the wife of a former MP. They talk up crime, talk up development and kick anyone who appears “woke”. All their developer mates get on and have a kick too. It’s a great way to start a coordinated pile on against non-LNP candidates right before an election. This is a deliberate political tactic.
42. You're confusing liberalism and libertarianism. Liberalism is a political and social philosophy that promotes individual rights, civil liberties, democracy, and free enterprise. On the other hand, libertarianism is a political philosophy that advocates only minimal state intervention in the free market and the private lives of citizens. In other words, corporations essentially run rampant. Nowhere in liberalism is there a belief that any actor gets to be so big that it creates anti competitive behaviour and dwarfs the individual. Liberals believe in empowering individuals, not on allowing corporations to run rampant. And cutting red tape is just code for Howard era pig headedness of not keeping corporations accountable for allowing negative externalities from business activity, eg dumping carbon into the atmosphere, where they escape the clean up cost of their behaviour and its effects are bourne by citizens and states for eternity. Liberalism doesn't believe in free rides for economic players.
43. Except it was the Liberals who legalised gay marriage and Labor who opposed it…
44. Democracy is only great if people make educated votes. If people vote for parties purely based on tribalism, mum/dad, an ugly face, and not what’s best for either them or the country, then it doesn’t work.
45. I definitely think (& have for years) that political advertising should be restricted to their own policies (all of them not just the "see how good we are" ones) and no smear campaigns allowed.
46. There needs to be better political education school curriculums, unfortunately, what is actually taught will potentially be biased depending on the type of school = extremely problematic. I grew up in a staunch catholic family and went to a catholic school, but I somehow always questioned what was being preached, sure that wasn't greatly accepted but I pushed along. Why were so many people living so poorly when the church had so much wealth? A fellow friend and student was the perfect catholic lad, an altar boy at church, who looked at our religious upbringing as a social place of morality and friendship and gatherings. In the 90's he came out as being gay, he is still to me the same person and still a good friend, and living a good life. Honesty has always been the right policy for me, do no harm to others, help those in need, never take others for granted.
47. True. Access to an abundance of information is one thing. Intelligence is another.
48. Dunno what you're on about, I'm trying to get my Citizenship for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea because I feel like Australia just isn't as democratic as I thought it was...
49. If politics were based on logic it would be called. Engineering.
50. It's called Rational Ignorance. The average voter knows their vote is near-individually meaningless in a large scale democratic election. So people don't bother putting in any great effort into being informed about politics. Some voters do put in effort into being educated politically but they probably do so out of some external reason - like finding Politics interesting or entertaining, akin to a spectator sport. But they won't do so because they think that will increase the value of their vote.
51. Infotech and telecoms provide the means to have effective direct democracy -parliaments (talking shops) were introduced in previous times when the tyranny of distance obliged local communities to elect a representative to attend on their behalf.
52. My comment was for sure an over simplification, but I’m talking in conversations where people are comparing LNP v labor and saying that labor is the conservative of the two because the LNP are liberal. Or arising out of a discussion about the referendum, the above mentioned lawyer seemed to think it would be obvious she would be a yes vote because she was in the young liberals
53. Liberal for business, not for social issues, where they're conservative.
54. There is. But Labor come from a union background - stronger together with a unified front. Alternative views are welcome with the camp - but in general they insist on a unified outward face. When Labor members say they’re working to change party policy from the inside, they’re sometimes criticised for not sufficiently standing up for their beliefs. But this is literally how that party works. And changing the whole party is (in theory) going to be more effective than striking out solo to stand and die on that one hill…
55. I like to think if I was going to make shit up on reddit I would put more effort in to come up with something more interesting than that
56. Tbf 2, 3 and 4 all apply to Labor too. It's only 1. that, in my view, is unique to the LNP in this case. (Youth crime was the only "issue" at this election that wasn't actually an issue at all. Labor doesn't have an equivalent imo.)
57. "Democracy basically means... government of the people... by the people... for the people... ......but the people are retarded"
58. NOFX said it best in 2003. There’s no point for democracy when ignorance is celebrated Political scientists get the same one vote as some Arkansas inbred Majority rule, don’t work in mental institutions Sometimes, the smallest softest voice carries the grand biggest solutions.
59. 4 people are idiots = see, democracy is a joke.
60. It was a tongue in cheek response to voting for the candidate that looked the coolest or cutest. Bench press numbers are not part of my voting consideration.
61. Times change, parties change, policies change - seriously get educated search and keep reading - learn how to think critically, we do not have to accept what we are given, eg; Greens "were once about climate and environment, animal/human welfare" no anymore.
62. That’s quite an absolute statement off the back of a real world example that IS a pretty solid argument against it. I’m not saying I support optional voting, simply commenting on the above. Should people who don’t even know what they’re putting on their forms be voting? It’s food for thought.
63. I grew up in the US and came here when I was 24. So I have the privilege (not the obligation) to vote in the US, and even now 20 years later I still vote every election as I'm a dual citizen. I don't agree with the compulsory voting in Australia. My husband, who's not American was always very supportive of it but we've been discussing more and more and he's now agreeing with my perspective too. In my opinion uneducated and apathetic voters are dangerous. People are too easily influenced when they don't care and are just doing it to avoid a fine. I don't feel it's an accurate representation of what people actually want and uneducated voters can be easily manipulated and "bought". Or they do stupid crap like voting based on what someone looks like ( as someone above mentioned their friend coding for the one who was the cutest). If people took the time to get to know where the candidates stand on the issues that are important to them, they wouldn't need "how to vote" cards. This was my first state election since I got my citizenship and I made my own "how to vote" card. For me. based on what matters to me. I took it with me and casually waved away the barrage of poll place volunteers trying to tell me how to vote and what matters to me. I said no thanks, I made my own, and quite a few said "good on you"! I think it's rare for people to care enough to do their own research. If you have the opportunity to vote and don't, then you can't complain. And if you have the opportunity, and want to vote, you research your candidates and make your vote count. I don't see how it's worse than making people tick boxes for candidates they don't even know anything about. Also, as a note, I voted in the US election already. And for the issues in the local country voting and state issues that I don't have any opinion on or know anything about, I just don't vote on those issues. I'd rather leave that part of my ballot blank than vote for something I don't know anything about. AND my vote still counts doing that.
64. The issue stems from a small group of people who can print trillions of dollars from nothing, and enslave the rest of the world taking their time and energy. Nothing’s going to stop that anytime soon. The compounding of interest means that it’s impossible to stop and will get exponentially worse. So why can’t we have a cleaner inner city and hyperinflation?
65. > but you do realise they are my family right? Ah. Good point. If you could maybe suffer a little bit too, just so its all kept neat and tidy. Like nothing serious, just a toe stub or something like that would be enough.
66. Does your family care how their choices affect you though? Nope.
67. hopefully she doesnt need an ambulance for the next 4 years
68. I didn’t vote LNP but I have to say the unions have way too much influence from what I understand. The amount of site walk-offs I’ve seen, the picket lines. Infrastructure in Australia is embarrassing.
69. The media didn’t make CFMEU branches recruit criminals and partake in criminal standover tactics you absolute thug lmfao
70. The first month Labor got in in 2022, mid June, they removed the ABCC, the watchdog for construction companies. 'We believe in "simple principles" like "the same laws" for all workers unlike the Coalition'. The ABCC had an over 90% successful prosecution rate against the construction industry at the time. >Labor has documented ties with the CFMEU, with the militant union donating $4.3 million to the party ahead of the 2022 Federal Election, which included $2.6 million in direct donations including for campaign advertising and $1.7 million through other means such as memberships and services, AEC disclosures showed. >Shortly after the election, the new Albanese government abolished the Australian Building and Construction Commission which had handed out at least $15 million in fines against the CFMEU. The CMFEU would go on to be found to have broken 2600 laws, fined $24m. Lawyers prosecuting the CMFEU and ACTU and investigators received broadsides from other unions, the firefighter's union. Anecdotally, one Liberal senator said that union workers hold sites hostage for pay increases. The workers tell managers that if management raise it with government and if workers are forced to work and forced to stop preventing others from entering job sites to earn where they picket, then they will intentionally break safety regulation to get the construction company fined, and intentionally build flimsy to have the building fail checks. These are the buildings we will live in... building future Australians will have to live in... the immorality for a bigger pay check. That lack of productivity comes out of every Australian's pocket, even the cost of living for landlords, driving up real estate prices and rent. It comes out of their own pockets, but yup they do get their greedy bag from time to time to cover it. Keep Labor's 4.3$ million CMFEU donations in mind when you hear him say to Dutton "sit down boofhead, I've got the call." He's more of a pitbull for unions than he lets on.
71. I think that’s what they mean. CFMEU traditionally pushed for Labor but now won’t, due to the recent debacle.
72. Unions stick together, do you understand how may people are union members in QLD?
73. Yeah my mum still has some trauma from it. She said they would get weekly announcements on Fridays at morning tea time and people would find out if they were cut or not. A bunch of people in her team either had heart attacks or mysteriously got cancer after a year of that stress… Also - the Together Union calculated last week that for LNP to make the numbers work with their promises, it’ll be approx 17,300 state gov jobs axed. Which, like Newman, will make the books look good for a hot minute, but then all those projects still need to be completed (esp infrastructure like roads) so the folks will get hired back as contractors and cost the taxpayers even more money. Is fucked.
74. I’m old enough to remember Joh, so I will never vote LNP. Campbell was a batshit crazy sleaze
75. Your comments are ignorant. Unions do have a place but I have first hand experince of them meeting at a maccas and saying stuff like "lets fuck them up" while planning work disruption, ive been spoken to in an intimidatory way by a union high up who wasnt even across the facts and ive had a union rep say no when i told them they should take the fight on behalf of an employee. Many union reps are great but your statements are ignorant to reality. Are you seriously arguing that the only people who get pissed off at union action are managers who want to exploit workers? Lol.
76. Not necessarily, he mentioned they were in HR so they're probably just in the meetings with no way to actually influence anything. So they just sit there and listen to the dickhead manager argue with the dickhead union rep. I've been in the meetings on both sides and can tell you that I left both eba negotiations thinking less of the union reps.
77. Was talking about this with my wife before during dinner. I think Steve likely knew he wouldn't win this elec, and possibly didn't commit to any Olympic venue, knowing it will be the next govts issue. Is that super naive of me?
78. He is using the 100 day thing to not announce prior to the election Victoria Park. Which would alienated regional voters as 2-3billion on an inner city Brisbane stadium wouldn’t have been on message. The new report will mimic the Quirk review and Vic Park will be home of the Olympics.
79. Yeah, his position was weaker. I suspect the alp selected qsac to flush scrisafuli out. But he didn't make a choice, and got away with it. Being in government, Crisafulli will have no choice but to umm make decisions. So we will see how that goes.
