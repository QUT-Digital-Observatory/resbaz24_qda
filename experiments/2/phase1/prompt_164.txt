Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. I know it's like talking to a robot. IF the Greens were not TOO EXTREME, they would not have lost seats and would convert many ALP seats into GRN seats. I don't know what Old Mate Emu wants, a Wikipedia article written by British Army Propaganda Units (77th Brigade) saying how the Greens are too extreme? How is that any kind of proof? Here's a simple one: cowering in the corner over climate change whilst refusing to discuss nuclear power. Also the precautionary principle is abused to a psychotic level. Furthermore: a common complaint made here is that when Bob Brown was unceremoniously punted, the Greens turned red. Well they had Lee Rhiannon who was overly unpatriotic in the 1980s and too Breznehev curious. What Australian wants development of anything blocked, no viable way to get reasonably priced electricity and mitigate climate change and USSR loving dinosaurs? \*Where's your peer reviewed article proving this? All of your logical fallacies so far have shown i that the Greens are not extreme enough!\* So where are their seats in the QLD Parliament? They're on the nose lil' bud. They will likely lose Senators at the next Federal election if their polling does not improve.
2. Nah. I know how to vote I know how the funding works.. He's only seeing LNP as capable of getting 50% in his logic and being a sanctimonious dick in the process.
3. That’s funny. The Greens actually went full “Menzies” on housing.
4. Being against nuclear power is scientifically illiterate. Oh and communism.
5. Is there anything specific in the Greens policy platform, published on their website, that you object to?
6. How do you figure? Menzies believed in establishing private ownership (to the point of suppressing state owned housing) because like all sensible conservatives, he saw that people with a house would become solid citizens (his type of people). Thatcher was the same. The petite bourgeoisie. They were his forgotten people. These were two serious leaders with a genuine grip on middle class conservatism, and of course the political success to prove they were right. I don't think any of that is true of the Greens. The most definitive statement of the Green's policy is the Max C-M NPC launch which is on Youtube including a transcript. He spoke after an expert on housing. In my opinion the policy is ridiculous, founded on the straw man of the "developer monopoly" and rich on conspiracy theory tropes that mark it is as genuinely peasants with pitchforks populism. It was the least convincing NPC speech I have ever heard. It was like watching a Year 9 presentation from an earnest but middle of the class student. Anyway, that is my subjective opinion. The Greens have to find a new job for him, he is the greatest political disaster since Thorpe. At least she's good fun. Maybe he'll simply lose his seat in a few months and that will be that. The policy contains a lot of detail, but it is not fundamentally about people buying their own house. It is primarily about a vast, absolutely unprecedented role for state owned housing funded by extraordinary levels of tax increase, the eviction of private sector rental housing, and a redefinition of private housing to be basically leases on housing with substantial state equity (obviously an echo of Singapore HDB). To portray any of this as Menzian would horrify both parties, in my opinion. As to the Greens, who never stopped telling us to look at the evidence on climate change (and rightly so), they need to be a bit more evidence-based. They have a few months to figure it out. Rents are starting to fall, they are at serious risk of being stranded by a changing tide, if that hasn't happened already. I so despise their pathetic efforts on housing I think they deserve it. Low effort, idiotic policy deserves to be punished, if there is any karma in politics.
7. I think you've gone a bit too far with the dumbing down.
8. You must not be very bright then. Why not make a specific claim that can be discussed, rather than speaking in obscure riddles? You seem to be claiming there's some sort of conspiracy involving the government and the ABC, and some obscure third party. Who is Monster Energy in this metaphor? And what the hell is barter town?
9. Menzies built lots of public housing. And home ownership had never been higher.
10. Would you vote for Master Blaster if he promised to get the Bruce highway up to a standard that would put the speed limit up to 110kph?
11. "In 1956, the Liberal-Country Coalition Prime Minister Robert Menzies renegotiated the 1945 CSHA, sounding the death knell to the golden age of public housing in Australia." [https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=menzies+and+public+housing](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=menzies+and+public+housing) (my search) and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public\_housing\_in\_Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_housing_in_Australia) (a good result) Home ownership peaked in 1967 at 74% according to ABS figures, the year after Menzies left office. He executed his plan of higher private ownership very well. He did that by selling a huge amount of public housing.
12. And the Greens policy is to build a shit ton of public housing to rent or buy. So that seems like it would work!
13. Except for the bit about the people with the money not wanting to pay for it and the bit about the renters not wanting to live in it.
14. We vote every 4 years, that's how our democracy works at a state level
15. No. We have fixed terms now. The only reason the Governor can be asked to dissolve Parliament for an early election is if neither party can form a majority.
16. I wish we could have recall elections like the US has at the state level.
17. It’s okay he’s committed to resign when he doesn’t reduce crime. Which of course being the honest person (that doesn’t even live in his own electorate) he is, he will honour. At least we get 50c fares (because as an honest man he’ll stick to this too), albeit by losing homelessness services.
18. Like it or not? We live in a democracy. There will be another election in 4 years.
19. I wish but unfortunately he looks like he has a strong head of hair
20. Trying to explain that the rules are the rules & the winner is final to a generation that came up on participation awards is tough. They think you can just reload the last save and have another crack until their team wins...
21. Im pretty sure there are avenues to call for an ealry election. Didn't it happen recently at federal level?
22. Have you tried to report a crime through police link? Policelink is reducing reported crime enormously just by making the form unbearable. Make the form easier and crime will jump, make it harder and it will drop.
23. i think people are normally pretty happy after childbirth is over actually
24. Im not a labour voter, i personally hate them they have ruined my life. But I despise LNP slightly more
25. Until he makes decisions that upset everyone. Inevitably haha 😅
26. The parliament can call an early election if it loses confidence in the government. But with LNP winning a majority government that's pretty much impossible
27. Federal parliament doesn't have fixed terms. The Prime Minister can, in theory, advise the Governor-General to dissolve parliament and call a House of Representatives election at any time. The only reason an early election can be called in fixed term states is if neither party can form a majority.
28. This is a great point - let’s make it happen. Democracy doesn’t end at voting. Talk your new local member about the challenges with the form. Surely something practical like this can be fixed.
29. OK so "Labour" have ruined your life, but you despise the other party more...what possibly could the LNP have done that's worse than them? I'm intrigued!
30. What have they done that’s worse than havin your life ruined?
31. The parliament can't call any election. Only the Governor can dissolve parliament and call an election. It's not impossible. 2 or 3 by elections could remove the majority. Even then it would not require an early election if the opposition can win a confidence motion. An early election is only required if neither side can form a majority and win a confidence motion.
32. Not sure what you are trying to correct. If a parliament votes no confidence in the govt then the governor will dissolve it and call an election. That's how the system works
33. Taxing Queenslanders more so he can lower tax on the coal companies so he can maintain the budget that Labor set while lining his pockets and he will call it screwing Queenslanders over, *oh wait no we cant that’ll make it too obvious. We’ll call it “Saving Queenslanders Money”*
34. Queensland Hydro is gone under the LNP. No more battery storage using pumped hydro.
35. Minister for womb retention Minister for sustainable mining profits Minister for youth correction
36. Can't wait to see who the minister for focus groups and shit populist policies will be.
37. The FGD felching Gina division is now at the top of the premiers dept
38. I know Mike Kaiser has been sacked, but can't find out his replacement (paywall). I was guessing last night that Campbell Newman would be the new DPC Director-General, since he is Cruisafulli's mentor so don't know if that is who it is or someone else.
39. Department of Mining Magnate Wealth Protection Department of Teenage Thief Flogging Department of Female Insignificance
40. And it won't cost hundreds of thousands like a hospital name change.
41. Yep. And QLD hydro was going to use revenue and funding to support tourism initiatives in the regions to sustain the towns post mining. Watch poverty in the regions increase again
42. Maybe you missed it, but they've expanded to four-word slogans now.
43. You clearly have no idea how much changing department names costs. I guess you're fine with hospitals being named after racists, though?
44. The only true answer is to wait and see. And then by time the next election rolls around you’ll be old enough to vote and able to make an informed vote, based on your personal observations. Don’t let people tell you how to think or what’s important. Just because something is popular or generally accepted does not make it ‘right’. Instead, think for yourself and let yourself decide what’s important and what’s right. Also don’t fall for the trap of sticking to one side, it’s not a football match, you don’t choose a team and stay loyal to them. Hold shit politicians to account. Be willing to swing in any direction. A lot will change in the next 70 years or however old you’ll get
45. The fact that people are commenting with "dunno, wait and see" is absolutely wild. We should know what policies we're voting for before we get to the booth. Long story short, Crisafulli has officially pledged to remove coal royalties (say goodbye to 50c fares, cheaper electricity and rego), wind back the clock on abortion rights (he refused to answer if he would or would not, but a majority of his members support a conscience vote, so he either supports that majority or they turf him, which he will want to avoid) and he has pledged to remove preferential voting. Even if we can vote them out in the next election, it's going to be tremendously difficult. It's also going to be very rough if you're a healthcare worker. Since the coal royalties are gone, the LNP traditionally cut from the health sector, and Newman famously cut 14,000 healthcare workers in 2013. It will happen again.
46. Go and talk to an older family member that lived through the Newman years.
47. It could just be my skepticism speaking but Newman wanted to privatise the prison system and it wasn’t profitable enough, so it didn’t happen. Filling them up with kids might make that a possibility this time around.
48. Hand out fat contracts to their mates. Hope you got cushy with them while they were in opposition
49. The LNP has commited to alot of the same targets/promises that the out going gov have put in place (eg 50cent fares) but the issues as I see are- Coal royalty tax- LNP will lower this and it will leave a sizable hole in the budget. This will likely result in less infrastructure development or bigger state debt. Youth Crime- like whats happening in the NT the new gov will change laws to make detention more likely for youth offenders. They also have promised to build some specialised detention centres to rehabilitate youth offenders. Abortion laws- the Katter party has backed off on their plan to submit a private members bill to re-crimilise abortion but now the gov has changed there is no obstacle to them doing it and LNP have a policy to allow their sitting members to have a conscious vote (so vote how they like and not be forced to vote on party lines). This would be a major mistake if it does get to a vote in parliament. Pissing off 51% of the population will not end well. Climate change- the LNP will likely slow down the push for renewables and approve more mining. Cutting services- Conservative governments generally cut social services and look for savings in Public service. The new premier has said repeatedly they wont cut public service jobs and considering what happened last time they were in gov they would be stupid to do anything to the public service but there are areas they could look at without too much negative press (eg external consultants costs) They will likely do a few other things like changing the political donation rules and getting rid of compulsory preferential voting (so voters can just put a numb 1 on the candidate they want and not give every candidate on the ballot paper a preference number). Personally Im not a fan of any of these potential changes but we are a democracy and the population has changed the gov so it is what it is.
50. Try and find Vote Compass on the ABC website. Answer the questions as well as you can and it will show you where your opinions put you on the spectrum. It will also then show you which party more closely aligns with your views.
51. They will like scrap the coal tax for the mining friends pretty soon, as a result many services will be slashed to raise revenue to pay for other programs that likely also help their mates, have yet to see an lnp government that does not go out of their way to do this
52. Mining company’s won this election. Don’t think it was about anything else.
53. I can see them selling off some of the state schools on prime real estate land. Broadbeach on the GC comes to mind and probably some inner city Brisbane locations.
54. If they go draconian and do things like widespread strip searching of children (something that happens in NSW) to show they’re “tough on youth crime” it’s going to piss a lot of parents off. That said, Queensland is a basket-case when it comes to white-collar jobs outside of the government. Christafulli alluded to attracting businesses to the state, so maybe that will change.
55. Remindme! In 1 year how f***** QLD is under the LNP.
56. The proposed changes to voting will make it harder for minor parties and easier to maintain the status quo. The LNP hate the public service (everything should be run by their private sector mates who will take extra profits for themselves while cutting costs/raising prices) The biggest change we're going to see is how the media report on the government.
57. As a young lad, just list down all the things that these politicians promised to do before being elected and see if they follow through with it. You will realise that no matter what party these politicians are in, they will backtrack on most of their promises, and nothing will change. They will "try" to pass in new policies, but there's a very high chance that it will get rejected, and they will say 'well I tried," and move on. Also, watch how much David is worth now and watch his net worth go up from bribes and dodgy dealings. Peter Dutton is somehow worth over 400 million...
58. Watch the Margaret Atwood LNP documentary, *The Handmaids Tale*. That's what Queensland will look like in four years.
59. The main change that will be very relevant for you is that the LNP wants kids sentenced to adult prison sentences. This is basically what the coalition promised in the NT and they delivered it, they will absolutely do that in Queensland too.
60. Personally, I think the main things the LNP government will do differently are: - Build an Olympic Stadium at either Woolloongabba or Victoria Park, rather than putting up temporary stands at QSAC. - Change the new law allowing 3 drug diversions for possession of ANY illicit drugs (including meth and heroin) before getting charged. - Change the rules around defendants being released on bail and sentenced to “softer” punishments that don’t involve jail time. I really think that’s about it. Their margin is so razor thin they know they’re on thin ice. Qld has picked the LNP for a “trial period” so there’s no way they’ll go all out - they know they’ll be punished the next election if they do. They’ll have learnt from Campbell Newman’s mistakes. In fact, I’d argue that the next 4 years is the most important time for the Qld LNP, even more so than the election itself. They have a chance to prove that they’re a reasonable party that can make good laws, and shake off the Newman stink.
61. Definitely just wait and vote on your own. You can make a decision and it's a good time to see how the state goes the next 4 years. LNP do hate the gays, coloured, women and poor people a bit. Most of their policy is based around that. So if you are outside that group you're probably fine
62. What they tend to do is sabotage government services that compete with the private sector (often their mates that donate back to them). Like healthcare, a private system benefits when people are forced to use it when public hospitals face cuts. Look at America for how dangerous that could become if they got what they want. Since Medicare was introduced, they have tried to gut/destroy it. They always will, its in their interests and they dont have to participate in the system they ruin. They often can afford to live protected from their own damage. The other worst thing they also do, is let our state atrophy. They often lack vision and only represent existing interest groups. They thus hinder or dont bother with investments that would drastically reform the state for the future. Looking at the NBN in particular for that one.... that could have put us ahead of the digital revolution, but nah, copper was better, and then it costed far more and fucked that up. (Which also competed with their interest groups, Murdock's foxtel services for example.) They are also largely dominated by the worst kind of Christians, the kind that feel that the state should enforce some/all of their believes, because they often think they operate a higher moral standard that everyone should follow. Ever heard one say "we should be/used to be a christian nation". (And to those types. Fuck you, we shouldn't have to live by your bs rules that you hypocritically often fail to follow). Often a means to feel better than others, rather than following any true christian teachings of loving and helping your neighbor. Thus they lack action on issues that help the LGBT community, or actively try to fuck them over, and then also push insane views on abortion. Like yeah, it sounds reasonable you shouldn't abort a 8 or 9 month term baby, till you think that one through for more than 2 seconds and realize that its only done for dire medical emergency's and thus these views get people killed/fucked up majorly. Often because they just hate the idea of people having sex outside of marriage, and thus you should "suffer the consequences" (some even for procreation). On the economy, well they dont really give a shit about the state beyond their own interests. They are often carrier driven people at best, and driven by insane ideology's at worst. The economy does worse under them and they often push us into debt. Which stems from the lack of investments, loss of assets they sold to their mates (who donate back to them), and tax cuts to things like coal mining company's. Who just get to dig up our resources and sell them, with a lot of that money going overseas, when it should be fueling the growth of our state. The environment will also suffer, they tend to cut back regulations that require mines to fix a lot of their damage, and also things that prevent massive tree clearing. under the lnp their record on treee clearing can often be compared to bloody brazil.... Because there is a bit of money to be made for some today, thus the environment gets permanently destroyed. They are often also just really dumb and out of touch, they are appointed to represent interest groups that exist, not push for a better future or running a state effectively. Be nice if democracy could be a choice between more than just, a party that can run things at worst vs effectively a parasitic entity. They very rarely fix the issues they campaign on, youth crime will get worse under them, crime always does. They cut the services that help those desperate enough to turn to crime/break the cycle of poverty/abuse that leads to such crime.
63. I recommend starting by reading the policy platforms of each party. Good luck finding it for LNP. The Greens’ policy initiatives are at https://greens.org.au/qld/plan . Will there be change. Yep. Do we know what? Nope, because the LNP never actually committed to anything tangible. Labor’s 50c fares were actually a watered down Greens initiative from the previous election which they carried through to the latest election as free public transport. Thanks to the costs of administering the ticketing system and enforcement it would actually cost the state about the same each year to charge nothing as to charge 50c per fare. The LNP have not indicated a plan to toughen abortion laws - what would “toughen” even mean in this context? What they have done though is repeatedly evade reasonable questions about their government’s handling of any bill that might be tabled with intent to repeal the current law passed in 2018, prior to which abortion under any circumstances was a crime in Queensland. As their own internal party rules dictate that any change to abortion law would require a “conscience vote” Mr Crisafulli’s claim that he could guarantee no change was an outright lie. But lies are his bread and butter. Like the lie that youth crime is out of control. By any measure youth crime rates are currently at a twenty year low. On this fact every state and federal crime and criminology authority agree. Yet they claim they will fix this problem that doesn’t actually exist. What they won’t do is address any of the specific types of crime that have increased in recent years. Most concerningly family and domestic violence, alcohol fueled assault and rape are all increasing. But the LNP have no plans to improve DV support and training within the QPS or to address the housing and cost of living crises that are driving these kinds of violence. They have no plan to fix the housing supply and demand imbalance by building affordable housing or eliminating tax handouts for rich property investors that are stopping first home buyers getting into a home. Because they are the ones profiting from it. In short neither Labor nor the LNP had any credible plan to really address the issues hurting Queenslanders. Their goal was simply to win the election at any cost and worry about how to pay for it later. The millions each of those two parties receive in donations from multinational mining companies and huge corporations all but ensure nothing much will be done to benefit voters that might negatively impact those donors. So expect more coal and gas leases, more heel dragging on transition to renewable energy and cleaner industry, more putting off meeting our global emission target obligations, more homelessness, more unlimited rent increases, more grocery price gouging, higher public education costs, more medical complications due to unaffordable health care, more suicides, fewer trade apprentices, more government interference in patient-doctor affairs, more back slapping with fat rich pricks, more poor kids falling through the cracks and, ironically, more crime. It’s gonna be a pretty shit 4 years. I hope you make it.
64. Assuming they will do what they say they will, less oversight and more money flowing into the coal and gas bohemoths and less money into renewables. More kids in jails to meet and join groups of people in jails that have shown time and time again to no actually help. The cycle continues.
65. Nothing will change, the same old broken promises and bad management
66. At best, selling this state to the homegrown oligarchs At worst, selling this state to the Russian and Chinese oligarchs
