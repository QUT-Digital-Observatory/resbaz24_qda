Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. Another thing that‚Äôs increasingly worrying to me is the amount of people who DON‚ÄôT vote, or who just don‚Äôt care to vote correctly in accordance to what they want. I‚Äôm a support worker for elderly who are still mostly independent and a lot of them don‚Äôt care to vote or they want to vote out Labor, but have no real reason to support this. To be fair, I didn‚Äôt really understand how my vote counted in the past but I was always there voting, sometimes wasn‚Äôt sure but always put independents first. After that, I couldn‚Äôt tell you how I voted the rest of the parties in order. Since last year I‚Äôve been keeping up to date with politics - while confusing to me still sometimes - I actually know who to vote for now, and how to order the rest of the candidates. I‚Äôm honestly feeling incredibly stressed about the results of this election if the lnp gets in because of misguided voters and terrible campaigning. I also read a rumour (and I‚Äôm calling it this because I have not researched about the lnp members to know or confirm this) that a lot of the members are very religious? And I just think if that‚Äôs what is swaying them to decide they are pro-life and not pro-choice, that sickens me. Religion should not have a place in politics nor be a determining factor on a women‚Äôs right to choose. Again, probably just a rumour and I let myself get too carried away thinking about this. If you‚Äôre reading this and you‚Äôre voting today - all I can say is show up and make your vote count.
2. Can someone tell me about KAP? I know who Katter is, but when I voted, there were only Greens, Libertarians, ALP, LNP, One Nation? Where does KAP come in? Or is it because there isn‚Äôt a KAP candidate for my electorate?
3. Be nice if Crisafulli could just an answer a question that is asked of him. Was asked only 3 questions on the today show this morning and just sidestepped each question.
4. Community or mates? It would be some of both, as always and then the voters will see it like the old blind men and the elephant, some feeling that it‚Äôs one thing and others feeling that it was something else based on their own varying values and priorities.
5. What? You mean you cant see how much better off you will be when he cancels the Truth Telling & Healing? We don't need to the truth of the ongoing impacts of the methods of colonisation and treatment of its original inhabitants. We've been good so far ignoring all that.
6. Well, yes. You'll be able to come together as a community to offer thoughts and prayers to the women of Queensland who can't get an abortion.
7. Crisafulli's electorate vote count is impressive. He is doing something right for his neighbours it seems. Reddit users in this sub are incredibly ALP bias so I'm not sure how much factual info you will get.
8. The good thing is we will see less of him now he is Premier. He got whinge about everything.
9. Do you think that the LNP will make a difference in QLD. I don't think so. You will get the same bad roads, the same crime rate. The LNP will not help the people that are finding it difficult to see a doctor. The LNP wont help with power prices or price gouging fuel prices. You all need to realise that it's a big game. You the public don't gain. Just SayinüòÄ
10. If nothing else, shifting all the director generals on from the public service and asking some hard questions of the people doing the work will have an impact. It's not a good thing for any company or government when leadership is stagnant and the things being swept under the rug are never challenged.
11. The LNP aren't community minded - Why haven't we learned that by now? ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
12. If you know Reddit is an e ho chamber, it seems an odd place to ask your question. Unsurprisingly I haven't scrolled through and seen a single lnp voter yet. So take the reason s you are getting for why people vote for them with a healthy grain salt
13. 99% of what this sub says about Crisafulli and the LNP in general is largely nonsense. There are way too many Labor followers/members here who are desperate to paint him as the next Campbell Newman. It's not only incorrect but it's a pretty dangerous way to go about things. Here's a general summary of their policy platform: Youth Crime: The LNP has focused heavily on addressing what they describe as Queensland's "youth crime crisis." They propose introducing "adult time" for young offenders who commit serious crimes such as murder and manslaughter. The plan includes spending $50 million on early intervention residential programs and $80 million on new court-sentenced facilities for young offenders in remote areas. Detention Policies: The LNP plans to introduce a minimum time in isolation for detainees who assault detention center staff. They also promise to scrap the clause in the Youth Justice Act that provides for "detention as a last resort". Public Transport and Utilities: Both the LNP and Labor have committed to maintaining reduced public transport fares. The LNP also plans to re-establish the productivity commission to conduct a regulatory review into the building industry as part of their strategy to address cost-of-living issues. Abolition of Payroll Tax: The LNP has promised to immediately and permanently abolish the payroll tax if elected. This move is aimed at alleviating financial pressure on medical practices and preventing increased costs for patients. The party argues that the tax is a short-term measure that could lead to long-term issues within the healthcare system. Youth Crime Initiatives: The LNP has focused on addressing youth crime by proposing "adult time" for young offenders who commit serious crimes. They plan to invest $50 million in early intervention residential programs and $80 million in new court-sentenced facilities for young offenders in remote areas. Additionally, they propose scrapping the "detention as a last resort" clause from the Youth Justice Act. Healthcare Improvements: The LNP aims to reduce ambulance ramping to below 30% by 2028 and promises to provide real-time health and hospital data within 100 days of taking office. They have also committed to hiring 34,200 extra health workers by 20322. Housing Development: The LNP plans to build 1 million new homes by 2044, including 53,500 for social housing. They have also proposed a $165 million shared-equity scheme to assist aspiring homeowners with deposits2. Stance on Abortion: Crisafulli has stated his support for a woman's right to choose and has assured that there will be no changes to the current abortion laws. He has emphasized allowing conscience votes on such issues within his party, reflecting a moderate stance on this contentious topic Path to Treaty: The LNP has vowed to stop Queensland's Path to Treaty and the Truth Telling and Healing Inquiry, arguing that funding should focus more on service delivery for Indigenous communities. Emissions Targets: The LNP supports emissions reduction targets set by the state parliament, which include a 30% reduction from 2005 levels by 2030 and achieving net zero by 20503.
14. The answer is no, the community will suffer and the effects would be almost immediate. There is a reason the coal companies are investing in his campaign (the same companies which he has investments in)
15. I'm not sure this is the place you'll get a good answer. My current local member is from the LNP and I've been pretty happy with his support of community causes. But he's also promised quite a substantial sum for new buildings at my child's school if the LNP win government. At the moment the school has to apply for grants or raise money via the P&C (ie the parents) when ever they need anything like money to replace or upgrade playgrounds, put in computer or STEM labs or even library books for when they changed the approach to phonics. We don't have anyone to write for grants unless we hire them, which hasn't been done, so we miss out on so much funding that other schools seem to get. And to be honest I don't think it's fair to fund schools based on being able to write for grants rather than based on when they actually need to upgrade their facilities. There are other things, of course, I definitely don't cast a vote based on a single issue. It's not a referendum.
16. Hi all! I‚Äôm a conservative voter, so probably fit the outside the echo chamber. I‚Äôm not strongly motivated by Aussie politics atm and less so by state politics. One of the issues that does motivate me and I‚Äôm sure many others like me is of course abortion. Society (me and most conservatives included) has agreed that women have the right to an abortion during the early stages of pregnancy. The current qld law has it at 22 weeks. Again there is general agreement that abortion must be available after that time for (physical) medical reasons. Under the labor government currently, a termination can still be performed, after 22 weeks, if the medical practitioner has consulted a second medical practitioner and there is agreement a termination should occur. The reasons for a termination are: 1) all relevant medical circumstances; and 2) the woman‚Äôs current and future physical, psychological and social circumstances. It is the second set of reasons that raises a serious question. Are we really contemplating termination of pregnancy after the baby would be viable if delivered for reasons to do with ‚Äúfuture psychological or social circumstances‚Äù? If we are not contemplating that outcome, why does the legislation clearly permit such an outcome. Indeed there legislation is silent on the status of the foetus where pregnancy is terminated after viability! These are tough decisions. My summary of the legislation is directly from the ‚ÄúTermination of pregnancy bill 2018‚Äù. Please do not try to challenge my reading of this legislation, unless you have also read it. It‚Äôs free online. It‚Äôs not a big document.
17. I guess this is a matter of perspective. But personally I judge politicians by how much they use evidence to inform their policies. On this criteria none of crisafulli's policies align with any evidence and have been called out as such. Miles' policies on the other hand are based on evidence for the most part.
18. He hasn't released any positive policies or grants that will benefit the state. The exact opposite in fact. Qld will get a lot more expensive if LNP get in. I cant believe we're about to throw all the progress we've made over the past 4 years away
19. He‚Äôs offering graft for his mates (eg rolling back laws regarding developer donations) as well as sinking the boot into out groups (eg more punitive drug laws) and women (eg abortion laws). Everything else is just lies (eg every word out of his mouth about health care).
20. So FYI - on Sportsbet, they had Libs at 8:1 favourites on labour last week. This has since been adjusted to -3.25:1 - so still a pretty strong prediction the Libs will get up. It must be the die hards who‚Äôll continue to vote because the campaign, from an end user point of view, has be backing Smiley Miley all the way. I don‚Äôt like him but I like his policies.
21. Don't be silly lol. The LNP actually helping people other than themselves and their mates.... does everyone not understand how they operate lol
22. Coz Poppa Rupert says so in every paper and station he owns or influences.
23. After the LNP canned the NBN and then living in an area where the NBN was implemented vs the area im in now with shit internet I put the LNP last every year. Labour not that good either Im not a fan of the excessive immigration without thought for who will build it all, i could buy an actual house but not these days, stuck getting crushed by strata pirates. Allowing the buying of piles of property left right and centre by internal and external money has hurt this country hugely and will hurt for decades to come.
24. Politicians really only care about their own wages and their job, so they all spin lies to try hook the public in so you vote them in so they have a job for a few years ,they really dont give 2 hoots for you or me or queensland or australia ,just the vote for them
25. It seems to me that people are having last minute hesitation about Crisafulli and the LNP. Many issues are lacking detail and require more detailed information. Regarding the abortion issue it seems to me that very late term, live birth abortion is no less than infanticide. But I don't know the full details. Is it just unviable babies are aborted. If not, full term live birth abortion is murder. In the last few days they have said no more pill testing. I wish young people would not touch this rubbish but since they do I don't want to see them die just for being dumb. Similarly the LNP announced they will cancel the 3 strike drug laws. I don't believe it is a matter of letting offenders off because I understood it was dependent on them undergoing counselling. Be very careful David Crisafulli. You and the LNP are poised to win tomorrow but you are flirting with throwing it away.
26. He'll help out one section of the community (conservatives) by hurting other sections of the community (women and the underprivileged). They love that shit
27. Supressing women's rights and killing our kids by letting them go to jail. How tf did we get here?
28. He isnt helping the community hes destroying it. He wants too get rid of aborsions which is horrible. What if i child gets raped? What if anyone gets rapes? Theyre suck with s child they dont want.
29. Count the number of pro-ALP and pro-LNP posts in this sub, that should give you an idea of the bias. And then compare it to the polls and bookies. Massive echo chamber!
30. I‚Äôm hoping he saves the 30 odd million labour wasted on the QLD racing integrity commission
31. To begin I would just say that I voted green in a safe inner city Labor seat, so what I say next is just an opinion What the LNP brings is they are not Labor. To be honest after nearly a decade in power I don't doubt there is quite a lot of bloat in the public service that a new government will feel they can trim It's inevitable that jobs for mates and duplicates exist. It would bee foolish for the LNP to replicate the hatchet job Newman attempted but it's equally foolish to believe that the current work force doesn't need a good refinement with a new set of eyes There is also the union stench that following the CFMEU debacle it will be a change of direction particularly with so much olympic construction going on On the topic of the olympics we will finally get some sort of decision regarding the main stadium, something Labor seriously dropped the ball on earlier i the year
32. Honesty you're probably not too far from the truth. It seems that both big party leaders here in Queensland seem to be just as bad as each other. I have resorted to voting for independents as my first preference in recent years, as I feel the big parties no longer stand for the values they once did. Although in saying that, in very simple terms LNP and ALP have some difference. I'll probably cop some hate for this, but I couldn't care less. ALP for the most part tend to spend a lot of money on welfare, public transport, education... which in the short term makes people happy. The problem with spending lots of money, is that it will eventually come back to bite the taxpayers in the long run. In that if you spend lots of money (sometimes money you don't have), you will have to pay it back eventually. But as a benefit they do make life a little easier for people, leaning on the side of a bigger government body, more progressive social/moral stances and tend to have a bit more of a globalist perspective on the world in recent times. LNP on the other hand tend to be more conservative in the ways they do things, both economically and at times morally/socially. They are normally economically conservative, so they put limits on public spending, to reduce government debt. This normally comes in the form of privatisation, tax reforms and focus on big business and high income earners as a way to increase jobs and investors. The LNP also believes in smaller government, which is why you'll see them closing down parts of government or public sectors that they don't see as beneficial or rather more beneficial as private sector industries. Their policies usually reflect a push against long term reliance on government, so you'll see policies about self reliance rather than government dependance. Morally/socially they tend to align more for religious Christians or general conservatives, this their push for abortion policies. Protection for faith based schools... So in essence, ALP benefit in the short term, but do damage to the economy in the long run unfortunately. LNP will be seen to be making life harder in the short term, but arguably more beneficial in the long run. Obviously there are differences on both sides, something like negative gearing from ALP I would argue is a conservative economic reform. Strangely the LNP is not in support of it seems. I think this is definitely seen more on a federal level then a state level. State level can be hard to gauge or see how this occurs sometimes. But as people have been aware of lately, things are coming out especially things about abortion, youth crime, housing...
33. A lot of people, mainly older have no real idea what these guys are doing. They get all their news from channel 7 and the courier mail.
34. He is going to make abortion a criminal offense so if you're a young woman I'd be saying a big NO, personally. Who thinks they have the right to make this decision for anyone else? Mind blowing.
35. Tbh no politician left or right gives a shit about you. They're all there to help their mates as they're the ones who donate a shitload and influence the policies. The best way to vote is to vote for the lesser evil. I reluctantly put the ALP first even though I cannot stand the major parties and the LNP + cooker parties last.
36. Truth is most of the posts in reddit are just political staffers trying to sway your vote either way. Do you seriously think you'll get answers here? And ffs why are you torturing yourself posing these questions. Have a look at the key issues and make a choice. Honestly, no one cares about you individually. All politicians have to balance out what's best for the community and their backers. Labor does it, LNP does it, Greens do it. Accept that. Get on with doing the good you can do in the community you're in.
37. Seriously if you vote either major party you‚Äôre voting against your own interests put them last
38. Vote for the Devil you know at the moment or vote for the Devil we used to know when D.C. was the Campbell Newman puppet master. The lack of choice for voters in politics is criminal, there should be a Royal Commission. The choice to waste money on the Olympics is going to make Queensland less livable..... how can anyone think that spending money on new sporting facilities is going to help Queenslanders keep the roof over their heads and food on the table. D.C. even wants to increase spending on sport facilities and cut money from essential services (he just isn't being honest about it and refers all his decisions to independent consultants doing a review after the election). He even wants to setup his future consulting business with government money. You know where he will be after he leaves politics, board of directors club with is new consulting firm
39. Building new prisons to fulfill his promises is kind of like a community stimulus project. They are phenomenally expensive to build, operate and staff.
40. Just his mates. Note.. he doesn‚Äôt believe in climate change or reproductive rights.
41. The government should be in the background, we the people should make decisions. There a bunch of circle jerkers, circle jerkers comes to mind.
42. Crisafulli? What name origin is that? Certainly not italuan 100%.
43. Steven Miles has the charism and is doing things. If LNP wins i call shenanigans
44. >KEVIN BONHAM: This has been accompanied by some remarkable changes in leadership ratings. In the final Newspoll, Steven Miles has recorded a Better Premier lead. >‚Ä¶ >That was his first Better Premier lead ever, and the first for a Labor Premier since April 2023, snapping a run of 17 losses from various pollsters. Crisafulli has gone from a personal rating of net +12 at the start of this campaign to net -3, his first negative rating of the term that I can find after at least 19 positives. >This sort of recovery by a state government that has started losing heavily in polling is very uncommon. The more people saw of the two Leaders, the more people‚Äôs opinions have changed. Crisafulli and LNP felt entitled to run a small target campaign, with no policy details, no costings details, scripted lines for the media, and his opinions to be treated as gospel. He wants to be revered as the Saviour who led the LNP to a landslide victory, where election night will be his coronation. QLD voters might write a different story on Saturday night.
45. Fucking this! That is exactly why I don't understand how they're predicted to win. I want to know the reasoning behind someone that votes for that shit stain of a party and I'm not talking about wealthy voters but the average Joe like generally curious
46. I'm actually blown away as to why so many people think it will be a landslide for the LNP. The bookies were like 20/1 odds at one stage for Labor to win, down to about 9/1 over the past few days I think. LNP are an absolutely terrible choice given some of their choices over the past few weeks. I'm aghast at how it's potentially so close. I can only imagine the pearl clutchers are thinking about "all that nasty youth crime" and wanting a change to "keep everyone honest" but Jesus, I'm mystified.
47. What makes you a swing voter? I dont understand people that say that they are swing voters?
48. And they're running the propaganda machine at 150% talking about how the greens want to legalise ice and heroin? You'd have to be mindblowingly fucking stupid to believe that shit.
49. Just another perspective - swing voting is interesting to me because when you're part of a marginalised group, you cannot vote based on policy alone. You have to vote in "survival mode" first. That is, will this government destabilise or stagnate on rights that affect my community's ability to just exist. Even just the rhetoric hitting headlines does real world harm to marginalised communities. When LNP went at abortion, suddenly they went after 50% of the population (not exactly, but you get the point). Suddenly, many people realise that conservative values that undermine social progress are actually deeply offensive to modern life and result in real world harm. As a member of the LGBT community, it's terrifying to think people entertain politicians who would do genuine life-altering harm to us, we're just too small to be as close to home to many people. That's obviously not what you're thinking when you vote, but undermining social progress is always at the root of conservative parties - whether they come out loudly swinging at women's healthcare, or quietly vote down a bill that keeps LGBT kids safe at school.
50. Labour has decreased youth crime and initated strategies to reduce recidivism through programs and early intervention Labour has developed more social housing than any other recent government Labour has increased healthcare services with introduction of minor trauma centers and more frontline staff Labour initiated grocery and petroleum station investigations into price gouging Labour supports super profits mining tax and has slated that to pay for many other community initiatives such as free lunch for school kids I‚Äôm labour all the way , lnp would never follow through on any of this
51. That‚Äôs the Katter/Nationals/God influence. Not to mention their financial backers in the mining industry. They have no interest in society, only wealth. Old mate is as bad as Newman. Corruption out in the open, repealing green policies so that his mining financial backers profit. Under LNP we move backward while the rest of the world moves forward, you only have to look at the NBN. He‚Äôs talking about CGT as a fix for the housing market like it‚Äôs Labor‚Äôs fault, they introduced it. They‚Äôre going to fix everything but are yet to say how and people are swallowing it. 4 year of going backwards unless you financially back the LNP or can help them get to power.
