Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

Comments follow:

1. I’m a former RN, was not impressed. Just my 2 cents though. You know we’re allowed to have personal opinions. I’ve found the urgent care in my town to be fantastic (prob better than the ED in some instances).
2. The time I called, as a former RN, there was ZERO critical thinking on the part of the RN. I was complaining of a specific issue, but their question algorithm kept pointing them towards something completely unrelated to my complaint. An ED triage nurse would be able up discern the difference because they’d be using their brain, not a questionnaire. Hope this helps!
3. To clarify, in your post you've said > The LNP will also cut new satellite hospitals Where did you get that information? It's not that I don't believe you, it's that all of the publicly available information I can find from the actual LNP doesn't say that at all.
4. Can you please provide a source which states the LNP is closing Satellite Hospitals.
5. Na just sick of them post crap in reddit. They'll lose. The world will keep turning. In a few years they'll be back in. The world will keep turning. Throughout it all, social media will be a land of fake posts that is used by political parties to influence people who can't think for themselves.
6. Exactly for example, if someone has symptoms of arm tingling and back pain, sees there's a 3hr waittime, then thinks 'well it's probably a pinched a nerve and i'll waste time' - when it could be a stroke or heart attack. All the education in the world wouldn't change how the brain rationalises not waiting around.
7. So how is this initiative different from people deciding whether to go to urgent care, a GP or hospital?
8. I’ve worked triage and we definitely given them alternative options but some are determined to be in the public waiting room and bitch at us about it anyway
9. > chuck a pen to paper and complain to your local member bold to assume people complaining about wait times are literate
10. Ahh I see you've tried the Q Health payroll system
11. You're right, healthcare needs nuance and data could be used a lot more effectively then just a number displayed on the screen for the public
12. I agree, but there are times when that is the only choice.
13. I don't think you mentioned you were a former RN
14. The current state government built seven satellite hospitals since 2023. They've proposed to build another seven satellite hospitals in Rockhampton, Fraser Coast, Yarrabilba, Cairns, Mackay, Sunshine Coast, and Beenleigh. OP means the LNP have refused to commit to the new satellite hospital projects. Since it's not LNP policy, they don't have info on it.
15. No they cant because they are counting the not building as removal. Which is labor play book of promising the world and complaining lnp wont agree as they know it not possible to fund. If labor where going to build 7 new hospitals why havent they in the last 30 year.
16. They're not removing them, they're refusing to build 7 more like Labor has promised
17. I think it's regular people like me who are worried about the LNP policies and cuts announced (yestderday!). My post above is a direct response to a public announcement from the LNP with references as to why I am concerned. Take your bias and emotion out of it and really look at what they want to do compared to Labor. They want to punish people for drugs the first time and reduce crime? They are creating laws that lock up more people and increase statistics, defeating the whole campaign. This is why reddit (a generally younger demographic) is pulling their hair out with frustration seeing these proposals.
18. Because it adds information *that is not relevant to the healthcare decision*, but may still influence that decision. If you're sick enough to consider going to the ED, then you should go to the ED. They will then assess you to see if you're critically unwell in which case you'll be seen straight away, otherwise you'll wait. If you look at this list and see "oh, it's a 3 hour wait at XXXX, I'll either stay home or go to this other hospital where it's only 2 hours even though it's half an hour extra away" you're putting yourself at risk. Not to mention that wait times are *meaningless*. If you go to the ED with a papercut, you *will* wait for many hours until every other patient has been seen. If you go with a severed artery, you'll be seen in 2 seconds. Which is reported, the average, the longest, the shortest? It's meaningless information since the queue isn't FIFO. The only thing that would be helpful is if staff at the EDs were given a bit of information about wait times, and could triage patients to ensure they are not critical and *then* send them to another hospital where they might get faster treatment.
19. A GP isn’t open at all hours. It’s just another variable people need to factor into their decisions. And as stated in OP’s post, with a link that you are free to read, this variable acts as a disincentive for people to go to urgent care.
20. The triage telehealth number is for that, my scenario would be for someone rural with only 1 hospital and no after-hours services to choose from, which is most of QLD. Its a persuading factor in getting timely care.
21. That person with a 3 day history of a sore toe who gets a cat 5, spends 16 hours in the waiting room overnight and then complains to the ombudsman about the wait times. Love that person. 🙄
22. I didn’t, so I’m saying that now because people are acting as though I don’t know what I’m talking about. Not only am I a former RN, but I’m also chronically ill so have a pretty decent understanding of the healthcare system as a whole. Public and private. It’s very bizarre when people defend it because while yes we’re lucky to just be able to access it, there is a lot wrong with pre hospital and emergency care in Australia as a whole. I’ve also worked here, in multiple states and overseas. But again.. I broke a cardinal Australian Reddit rule of “don’t ever be negative about something ppl like no matter what your life experience is, other redditors are the only correct ones” 🥴
23. But to the contrary as shown above they have committed to bolstering satellite hospitals. That isn't scrapping. That is the direct opposite of defunding.
24. Labor built seven satellite hospitals since 2023 and have proposed another seven. It can be built. It can be funded. The LNP have chosen not to commit to the projects.
25. Can you please link the source that says they're refusing to build them.
26. Look I get your concern. And we all want a better society. But, honestly, worrying about this stuff isn't healthy. Deadset get out there and do good. Politicians do their best. They get it right most of the time. Worry doesn't solve it, just hurts you. Didn't mean to be a prick to you. You seem like a decent person and I'm sorry.
27. I'm well attuned to how the political system works. Am connected with both major parties through my work. Miles is a good guy and so is Crusifulli. The media beat up on both of them is hyped up. Happens every election cycle. Then... The world keeps turning. Whoever wins, things will always get better.
28. I did the telehealth thing yesterday and the doctor said “I can’t give answers over telehealth” im like so why was this suggested to me? Its garbage service in my opinion…the gp’s refuse to run tests or do referrals, the satellite hospital told me to go to hospital because they couldn’t treat the issue i was having and the hospital treated me like a bloody burden wasting their time despite the bleeding hole in my breast that was badly infected at that point .. i think Australias health system is a joke and only getting worse ..no ones taken seriously..people can’t afford or get into gp’s mine was booked out that day and reception told me to go to satellite and the satellite just told me they couldn’t do anything because they are a glorified building and to go to the hospital..my health is getting worse and no place is listening or taking it seriously and i have given up with it ..the hospital refuses to run tests and tell me to go to gp who also refuses to do tests and tells me to go to hospital ..i hate the runaround Im letting it take me next time im done fighting for competent healthcare its not worth the hassle anymore
29. Yeah I wouldn't have framed it as cutting new satellite hospitals. The LNP are continuing funding to the existing seven satellite hospitals, but are not committing to building the new seven satellite hospital projects proposed by Labor.
30. How many of the LNP proposals have Labor committed to fund?
31. Well they haven't announced its part of the plan? So they won't be building them
32. I can understand why we all feel frustrated for different reasons and i agree i actually need to worry less lmao, so thank you for apologising and actually helping my worry there
33. They adopted all of Labor's Budget in June, promising to honour Labor’s Budget over the next four years. Since then they've add on a range of Labor policies during the election.
34. So you lied. Thanks, that's all I needed to know.
35. So that answered none of the question. How much of what to the LNP are promising are Labor committed to? You're saying it's wrong that LNP aren't committed to Labors promises about satellite hospitals but this is a two way street. Why should LNP be singled out for not committing to another party's promises if Labor aren't either?
36. The LNP released their policies and "costings" this arvo. Adopting new policies two days before the election would be nonsensical for Labor. I'm stating fact, * Labor built seven satellite hospitals since 2023 * Labor have proposed another seven satellite hospitals * They can be built * They can be funded * The LNP have chosen not to commit to the projects You interpretated that as a negative for the LNP, which is your prerogative.
37. I don't understand how this is hard to understand for these people lmao
38. Can’t wait for BERT Summer 😍 24.4 bendy girl ⚡️
39. Massive missed opportunity to call it the River City Rollers
40. As much as the 'Metro' gets memed, I don't think anyone really has an issue with the idea of using the busways for high-capacity, regular interval transport. In fact its pretty great. But a metro it aint. BERT is a winner. It's funny, its lighthearted, it's a million times better than the GLink.
41. I said it before previously, but I really like the idea of calling the 'Metro' lines B:Link just like Gold Coast's G:Link. They would be somewhat fundamentally similar networks (tram bodies running on their own right of ways with similar-ish capacity) so I think it would fit quite well.
42. Agree, and we need ERNIE too.😂 "Metro" specifically refers to trains anywhere else in the world so yes embarassing. Confusing for tourists? You bet your Albert Street Station
43. Great, and let's rename the existing trains to: Electrified Rail Network - Intercity Express BERT and ERNIE
44. I propose BIATCH - brisbane integrated advanced transit commuter hub. It just slips off the tongue so nicely.
45. Isn't it just an oversized articulated (accordion) bus? ... or "tram on (tire) wheels"
46. It’s not a transport system. It’s just a special vehicle type that uses the busway network. Even with the metro upgrades, the busway is still the busway. Call the vehicles the Bertie Buses or the Bluey Buses, but let’s not pretend this is actually a complete transport system unto itself that requires its own name distinct from the busway.
47. Would everyone actually have preferred the entire busway to be shut down for years and converted to rail? Why does it matter if it’s on a rail or wheels if it gets you from point A to B? I don’t get it…
48. "My bones are so brittle! But i always drink plenty of... Malk?"
49. Or, hear me out, A Bus, or if you really care An Electric Bus
50. Only if it can be followed by the Eastern Region New Independent Electrics (ERNIE). It’d have to be a separate system of course, but it could work and run all the way up to the Sunshine Coast and down to the Gold Coast.
51. Why not the CityDog in honour of the CityCat? Then that means we can rename Cross River Rail the CityRat or CityMole.
52. I've previously suggested the Brisbane Infrastructure Transport Connection Hub, but BERT does have a nicer ring to it to be honest.
53. The next Olympic city, who has also done the Olympics in 1984, Los Angeles calls EVERYTHING Metro. Bus, light rail, subway. ALL OF IT. The name of the organization is literally metro https://www.metro.net Not to mention the G-line, which is lettered and mapped on with all the rail lines is a much shittier BRT Brisbane doesn’t have a tough act to follow
54. >"Brisbane should save the Metro title for the underground rail subway system that will eventually be completed." This is such a fundamental misunderstanding of Brisbane's transport network. Brisbane is not getting an underground rail subway system. There has never been any real proposals for an underground subway system, and Cross River Rail is not an underground subway system. It always bemuses me at how many people think that CRR will be this rapid transit like, flashy metro/subway network (like the Sydney Metro). All cross river rail is, is an additional river crossing which will carry the same QR narrow gauge lines that the current network uses under the river instead of over it via the Merivale Bridge. That's it. It's not a new system, it's not a subway. It won't ever be a system, as it's not designed for expansion. It's literally a tunnel that will carry existing lines from one side of the existing QR narrow gauge network to the other. It won't even get designated as a new line, as it's not it's own line, it's just a stretch of track. Yes it will have stations on it, and the stations might look like rapid transit\\metro stations, but ultimately they are still just heavy rail stations. Brisbane metro on the other hand, is not a true metro either, but that's a whole other can of worms.
55. Well San Francisco already has BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) so why not BURP… Brisbane Urban Rapid People-mover or BUMT…Brisbane Urban Metro Transit Our possibilities are immense…
56. Keep it BERT but implement a Electric Renewable Network Integrated Express
57. I wouldn’t consider Melbournes rails network a genuine ‘Metro’ network…
58. The name is fine, and doesn’t matter as much as people here think.
59. Does the name really matter so consequentially that it is worth the cost to switch names over (even if it is only a few millions dollars)? Does it run on tracks? No. Does it have a completely dedicated piece of infrastructure? Yes. Does it transport much more people than a bus? Yes. Does it run frequently on dedicated routes? Yes. Is it underground? No. It really seems like the argument for a name change boils down to semantics. So many people are imagining 'horrified tourists' arriving en masse for the Olympics to catch the metro and having a heart attack when "my god... it-... it-... it doesn't even run on tracks". As if the existence of tracks automatically signifies a modern and high quality public transport system? And what do you think will happen when someone talks about the BERT? A tourist struggling with finding their way around the city asks a local "excuse me, how can I get to South Bank" and the local responds "oh sure you just catch the BERT". They are more likely to wonder if they missed something in English class than think "oh they must mean catch that gigantic bus that looks like a tram with wheel covers over there". It seems from what I can tell that the primary point of OP is that if it isn't underground it shouldn't be called a metro (especially by trying to draw a comparison to Melbourne). At this point you have to wonder if people get really confused when they eventually catch the Bankstown metro line from the Western suburbs of Sydney and think "but it isn't underground... this mustn't be the metro". Perhaps something like 'M-Bus' catches the pure semantic meaning of the service in the same way that the 'S-Bahn' does the job of explaining it clearly in Germany. It isn't really catchy though and I don't think we quite aspire for the German's love for efficiency, so I still in my mind can't really justify millions of dollars to change the name and advertise the name change to confused people who could have sworn that "there used to be a bus called a metro here, but now I only see M-Bus on the journey planner". At the end of the day a name change has to be so beneficial to overcome the many consequences of changing a name, and I don't think there is really enough of a benefit here to justify it.
60. I'd put money on us Brisbanites whingeing and whining when we cop international flack during the olympics about the naming of these buses, while also defending the name choice. It's like naming a train "automobile". It's just confusing and dumb.
61. Who cares? ... clearly some of you. Adelaide and Auckland call their entire bus networks the Metro. Paris has a monorail called a Metro. We are using it to distinguish between buses on non-dedicated roads, a full EV, and biarticlated vehicles. For now, Metro will do. Let's get it going to more places.
62. When I ride the BERT I wanna hear those BERT classics
63. Can this topic be a part of a utopia episode? If it already is, I’m going to watch the whole series
64. This is the only other name I would want for it. Any replacement name has to be short.
65. I've said this since it was first announced. A missed opportunity.
66. Feels like a throwback to 2006 when everything was getting called i-something. Remember iVegemite? I don't want to.
67. >BERT is a winner. It's funny, its lighthearted, it's a million times better than the GLink. GLink does sound way too corporate, something straight out of Utopia.
68. I think this is the only real issue, that it simply is not a metro by any stretch of the imagination. Why don't we rename central station to Brisbane Airport? It's just like planes but instead of having them fly through the air with jet engines we give them metal wheels and put them on rails!
69. Nice, but only if the entire busway is illuminated with low-level lighting.
70. Honestly wouldn’t be mad if it caught on. “I’ll catch the Bluey to Cultural Centre”. Doesn’t have to be an acronym, could just be a cool name.
71. I cannot think of an acronym for ERNIE. Bert will forever be without his lifelong friend.
72. Well we already have unique names for different levels of the bus services: * Rockets * Bullets * BUZ * CityGlider * City Express What's wrong with one more name for a different level of service. That being said I don't really like the name Metro or Bert. Like who is going to say: "just hop on the bert", "I caught the bert", "I love the bert".
73. Everyone just mad about the naming. The solution is actually a pretty smart use of existing infrastructure
74. The actual solution being delivered is not on the same level as a true metro project, so naming it one is misleading. A metro generally consists of high capacity trains running on their own dedicated rights of way at very high frequencies (every few minutes during peak times). The Brisbane Metro misses the mark on all of these, except for maybe frequencies, although this will still be at the lower end compared to most metro systems. Many of the benefits of the Brisbane Metro could have been achieved through a cheaper bus network review, similar to the one abandoned in 2014.
75. Rather than that, would have been nice if the busway starting in eight mile plains was upgraded to trams, then each station up the line to the city was subsequently shut down and refitted. That way people who live on the busway can still travel one of two directions while the works are ongoing without transfers, and when it’s their turn for upgrades it’ll be much shorter than waiting for the whole busway to be upgraded. But yes I would have rathered rails. Electrified so they don’t need to run on expensive batteries, and can be fully automated in a way smart driving busses just won’t be for many many years. And when you have a line that’s powered indefinitely by connection and doesn’t need a driver, it can run 24 hours at low cost and high frequency and on public holidays. This is something big fancy busses can’t do, but trams could.
76. ERNIE is on board. >It’d have to be a separate system of course, but it could work and run all the way up to the Sunshine Coast and down to the Gold Coast. Anything but East / West, that is never needed... just multiple parallel lines with the coast please.
77. I don’t think the OP or others are saying CRR will be a metro/subway system. They’re referring to a brand new line that whilst not officially proposed, has been widely discussed to run from Brisbane’s western suburbs to the north-east via West End, CBD, Bulimba, Hamilton, etc.
78. I don't think there is any widespread belief that cross river rail is anything other than more tracks on our existing rail network, they just happen to be underground. Also, there was a plan for a Brisbane subway which was a genuine metro line included in the connecting SEQ 2031 plan. It just never progressed, but it gets occasional airtime in the media (i saw an article maybe a month or so back). That's what people are hoping to one day call the Brisbane metro
79. >There has never been any real proposals for an underground subway system There was in the 1950s. There are plans from that time floating around somewhere online and will try to find them. Brisbane Subway between Toowong and Bowen Hills was also part of the Connecting SEQ 2031 plan.

80. No Australian city has a true metro. A true metro is a fixed guideway system that exists somewhere between suburban rail and light rail. Compared to suburban rail, speeds are slower, stations are closer together, and the system is intentionally designed for anywhere to anywhere journeys (as opposed to journeys to / thru central). They are typically entirely separate from both the road network and the regional / freight network. Melbourne's "metro" is a tart up of the legacy suburban rail system. It has fewer level crossings than it did, but isn't entirely separate. It has dedicated regional / freight tracks on some routes but not out through Pakenham. Changes are proposed, but every train still starts and ends at Flinders St. Adelaide's metro is just the public transport system, ie buses, guided buses, trams and suburban trains. Even Sydney metro is very far from a true metro. It exists separate to the suburban rail system, but it features larger, more widely spaced stations, trains that run a similar timetable to the legacy suburban rail lines (but at a higher speed), and routes connecting outlying suburbs to Central. It's more suburban rail (and less metro) than the legacy Sydney trains. I think that, at this point, the word Metro has no meaning in the Australian context.
81. No, they are just new, longer buses using the same busways as all other buses
82. the metro route is dedicated to public transport only for the entire length
83. It is about 99% dedicated lanes. There are 3 sets of lights between South Bank and King George Square stations where metros might wait for pedestrians to cross (and I think one of the set of lights might still be a car crossing). But for every other section it is bus/metro only.
84. The "metros" are about teice the capacity of a regular rigid bus and about half a 3 car train, or less than 2/3 of a G-link tram. They will only run at 15 min frequencues off peak. And have several grade crossing points. I mean at this point it has about as much in common with a 3-car inter city exoress train as it does a Metro.
85. >I'd put money on us Brisbanites whingeing and whining when we cop international flack during the olympics about the naming of these buses, while also defending the name choice. We're a stupid bunch. Congrats on being first one here to whinge and whine without any useful insights to contribute. Do you like the Metro branding?
86. What is Electric Rapid Transit? A bus rapid transit system. Which is electric. Y'know, exactly what this type of system is?
87. Someone said the other day they should be called 'City Dogs' and I thought that was cute.
