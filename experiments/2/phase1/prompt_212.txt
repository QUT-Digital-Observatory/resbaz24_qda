Your job is to analyse a series of Reddit comments from discussions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The major parties that sought election were the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition. The Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party were minor parties in the election. 

The key five issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election were Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living Crisis (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). We include some context of the major parties positions on these issues. 
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Downplayed claimed youth crimewave. Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.
Cost of Living Crisis (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.
Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.
Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.
Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze the comments and code them according to two dimensions:
1. The ISSUE the commenter is primarily discussing, if it is one of the five listed above. Use the codes YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If no issue applies, omit the code entirely.
2. The PARTY the commenter appears to support. Use the party codes ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP. Infer party support where possible, e.g. a commenter fearing the outcome of an LNP victory likely supports ALP, and vice versa. Ensure there is either direct or clearly inferable support for a party before assigning a party code. Assign a PARTY code only if the comment expresses explicit support for, or opposition to, a specific party or its policies. This support or opposition must be clearly discernible; mere mention of a policy is insufficient. Look for indicators such as positive or negative sentiment towards a party's actions or policies or explicit endorsements or condemnations. Comments may express opposition through sarcasm or irony. In cases where party support is not clear, omit the party code entirely.

You will output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string, and a "party" property set to the party code string. In cases where you cannot determine an ISSUE or a PARTY, do not set a null value, omit the appropriate JSON properties entirely,  e.g. If the first comment did not have a matching issue and you could not determine party support, then the object would simply be {id: 1}.

1. I study vet and am also from close to where you are, the only thing keeping me here is uni. The uni is great, despite JCU letting in people who achieve lower atars, you'll graduate better than majority of other vet graduates from around Aus if you put in a bit of effort. The vet cohort also has an amazing culture, we do so much fun shit. Join the facebook page JCU Vet Students Association. As for Townsville, its a hole. The weather suck, the crime is laughable and theres nothing to do here apart from drink. Slowly theres more markets, events on the strand etc. but you go through the free entertainment options pretty quickly. The weather is pleasant for two months of the year. There are very nice camping spots/nature spots around, however they are a good hour drive, crystal creek a bit less than an hour, but theres only so much fuel you feel like burning as a uni student. One positive, the town is very young being full of uni students and army people (but do avoid the AJs), and the traffic is minimal. It is a very laid back bogan place, pleasantly humble! As for college, John flynn or Saints if youre social, BY if youre looking for more apartment style, avoid George Roberts. Plenty of share houses going around too, join the facebook group called JCU Townsville Accomodation or something like that. Students tend to live in Annandale, Douglas, Aitkenvale area, howver Douglas gets hit really hard with car theft etc. I am very negative about it here, but I have made some great friends and met my partner here and definitely don't regret it, but I will be moving away the second I graduate.
2. I have just recently moved away from Townsville myself. I love Townsville. It's fairly laid back, easy to get from one side of town to the other in 20 minutes. You have 2 beautiful beaches at your doorstep and many others within. 20 minutes drive. If you love the outdoors, you will enjoy living in Townsville. I lived there for 43 years *touches wood* and I wasn't broken into once, never felt unsafe walking down the street. Just like anywhere, just be aware of your surroundings. Don't forget you also can escape to Magnetic Island for about $35 ferry ride return and the snorkeling over there is beautiful. It's only a 25 minute ferry ride. Then you have the creeks and tributaries around. As long as you're not looking for night clubbing and banging scenes like that, you will like Townsville. We also do have most of the shops that the south has, I say most but not all. But you can always order online anything else. Good luck with your decision my friend!
3. Just moved up from Sydney and love it way more here!
4. I suppose its what you make of it. If you love the outdoors, theres heaps to do around. And considering you are joining a program, socialising will be 100% easier for you. However, moving from Sydney it will be a change. Its very laid back here. Towns dead throughout the week and a few places pop off during the weekend. But on the bright side, no traffic and everything is <20 mins away. Finding a place to stay is a hassle but im sure thats the case eveywhere. When I relocated here for work 1.5 years back, I had a relocation bonus that essentially lasted me 2 weeks of airbnbing. I found my unit within that timeframe but I wasnt choosy and went with the first place that accepted me. My advice would be to do the same but to sign the least possible lease period i.e 3 months or 6 months. Once youre in tsv for that youll have a better gauge about your movements and what areas you like. Also, public transport here isnt the best so might want to focus in finding a place close to uni. Godspeed.
5. JCU is great, it’s a whole life without ever leaving campus. If you love wildlife and outdoors it’s really groovy there.
6. i like townvillle done about 20 years here now it got all the service of a city without a long drive to get to them. personal live in share house but you can try dom life if you drive cheaper to share house. thing to do there lots nature and maggie wildlife there look at group. just rember sydeny only short flight away
7. Renting in TSV is hard. I've lived all over Oz, even during the rental crisis in Brisbane I was able to get a rental, here, I'm rejected for everything and I'm a public servant. I tried to share with others but didn't have any like finding anyone to share with, most were middle aged men with questioable intent however there's a few houses around Douglas that rent rooms to uni students, they are often advertised in realestate.com if you just look up Douglas as the suburb. I am an avid outdoor lover and I can tell you there's not alot of outdoor fun to be has here that doesn't come with large crowds (the strand is very popular, as is castle hill and magnetic island is a headache during peak season in my opinion. You need to drive a couple hours away to get some good outdoor time. The wetlands here at town common are excellent for bird life and a few hours of hiking. There's even crocodiles in there that you can see living life in the wild. Being young you might be more easily pleased then myself so keep in mind my comments are from a jaded tired woman twice your age haha.
8. Townsville like most of Australia it's very hard finding accommodation ATM I do suggest reaching out to Townsville guest house on stagpole st, It can be your home while you look for something more permanent Damian is a great landlord but rooms are subject to availability. You can also try the hotel in hermit park/mundingburra its on the main drag to rosslea they have rooms for $400pw All the best in your search for a place to live in Townsville. Its a great city and people greet you a stranger in the street.
9. I was born in Townsville, but moved away around 21. It’s changed a bit since then but not really for the better. I’ll probably get downvoted for this, but unfortunately it can be pretty homophonic/racist(part of why I moved away) however you can still find good people. As for the Vet science course at JCU, it’s actually pretty great from what I can tell. I have several friends who studied Vet science at JCU, I even dated one; they all loved it. They were all very close with one another, and I think the people I met through those friends were all great people, so it shouldn’t be hard to make friends. All I can say is if you end up living on campus, prepare for a pretty hectic drinking culture.
10. Townsville is a shit hole. There is no silver lining. It will be tough. It may break you.
11. Appreciate this, nightlife being a buzzkill doesn’t bother me thankfully. I definitely would be keen to learn to scuba and as a wildlife photographer, would love to check out the areas frequently. Thank you!
12. Guess everyone fits into places differently, just got to hope it’s somewhere I’ll fit into as I’ll be stuck for 5 years, If I decide to move here 😅The climate will definitely take getting used to but hopefully it’s bearable.
13. No worries at all, I appreciate the comments and advice!
14. I have heard good things about their program also and how practical they train the vets to be. Glad you’ve had a good experience with the clinic that’s great to hear. I appreciate the advice on accomodation but it’ll probably be awhile before I find a more permanent solution as I find my footing and look for some work.
15. Sorry to hear you had a rough experience, it’s never great. Glad to hear that you’ve heard good things about the culture of vet science at JCU, fills me with a bit more hope adapting to such a big change. Much appreciated!
16. Honestly you won’t be stuck, if you decide you don’t like it after 12 months, you can always transfer to another university. Don’t stress! Come on over and give it a shot here. Lots of people from out of State really enjoy it here and make lifelong friends.
17. past student here. loved mount lofty. i was a centenary student first and hated it there. i was scared to move to lofty at first but it was the best years of my schooling life there and i wish i started out there
18. I didn't go there but remember them having a pretty good music program around 2000-2015 area. They would often do pretty well in Eisteddfod comps and things like that.
19. Past lofty student, graduated in 2005 and it was a good school then. But that’s a long time ago now so things might have changed but I look fondly on my high school years.
20. Do it. It's better than centenary 100 times over. Smaller school, they've got a good performing arts area and better student support. My best mate went to centenary and I honestly believe he wouldn't have as many issues with drugs as he does if he never went to that fucking school
21. I am currently doing some releif teaching in Toowoomba. TSHS is my favourite by far. Smaller class sizes (and school size), strong leadership, long-term teaching staff, family extensive sporting facilities, and generally amicable student population. Also, good elective subjects options I wouldn't have expected to see in a public school. Good luck with transitioning if you decide to go ahead.
22. Recent past student. I thought it was run of the mill. It happened to work out great for me, but not because it's a great school. From what I hear it's getting worse in terms of property damage, required security, and lock downs. Pushes a lot of it's funding and focus into the arts. I can and will complain about that until the end of time, but as a result all of my "difficult" stem classes were super small, and as a result better. Also some phenomenal teachers who deserve more credit.
23. Past student here. Many years now. I did not find it to be a good school. Still remember windows missing in some classrooms and freezing in winter. Principal at the time was awful. Bullying was an issue at the time. But many years ago like I said so I'm sure things may have changed. I would have chosen Wilsonton campus. Friends I had there loved it and my husband went there too, also loved it.
24. My daughter is in year 12 at lofty and we have always found the school great, no issues at all
25. I liked My Loft but it has been a long time since I went there Ran into my old Maths teacher last year, was a new teacher when I first started there in my 20years now. But I don't know what that means for the school.
26. Most of the kids I knew who went to Lofty really liked it - it seems like a really relaxed place with newish facilities now. I went to St Ursulas but kind of wish I went there. (im 32 so this was a long time ago)
27. My kids graduated within the last few years. I don't regret sending my kids there. There were good times and bad times. They did drop the ball for one of my kids but COVID was a part of the cause so I can't say the same would happen today.
28. Yesss. The school I go to is Centenary and it still sucks. Seriously bad drug culture and the bullying against mentally issued students is insane. That's why I'm considering moving.
29. same situation here but graduated 8 years ago (god that makes me feel old), lofty was so much better, especially for any flexibility needed related to mental health
30. I'm a very musically talented and oriented student, so I'm seriously considering it
31. As a student who fell into the drug culture in centenary and was lucky enough to find support to help me, it's horrific. I'm definitely making the change
32. Haha wow, I went to wilsonton campus for 8-10 and lofty for 11-12. My kids will never set foot on wilsonton campus for any reason.
33. I enjoyed wilsonton when I was there but I wouldn't send my child there now. I'd be open to lofty, though. Some of the good teachers I had across Wilsonton and Lofty are still at Lofty now.
34. I've met the current year 12s. The fact that she's had no issues is nothing short of a team effort divine intervention from the gods of every major religion.
35. Previous Centenary student, my god it’s awful, the teachers watched on as SA happened, never took people seriously when they reported it. I know a girl that went to the head of year to report that a boy kept groping her daily and his response was “he’s just trying to be your friend, and doesn’t know how to go about it”, they were in year 10!! My sister transferred to lofty after being at centenary (graduated 2021) and she absolutely loved lofty. Such a positive experience for her.
36. i left because of bullying. not towards me, but towards a friend and i watched as no staff there did anything to stop/help it. i was a recent student at lofty and i can say its come a long way since what i heard before going there. it’s a lovely school!
37. that’s crazy, we would have most likely been there at the same time :)
38. You've got this! I hope you find your people :)
39. Oh my god, seriously? That's so fucking disgusting. I'll definitely be moving.
40. Irrespective, it's legal to record conversations in Queensland as a one party consent stage. Any politician who is afraid of being recorded should scuttle away like the little cockroach they are.
41. I haven't lived in Toowoomba for about 5 years, but when I did, he used to always be at the Spotted Cow, parking his van with his mug on the side of it out the front. I met him there a few times and it sounds like he is still just as much of a knob now as he was then
42. Queensland is a one party consent to recording state, and you shouldn’t state something you’re not willing to stand by IMO. If he’s willing to vote that way he should be willing to say it and have it be known. If he suffers at the polls, he should be willing to stand by it.
43. If you're in Qld its not illegal to record audio in your vicinity. It's illegal to play it back or distribute it as I understand it. I looked this up because when I moved to Qld I wanted to know what the legislation was for home security cameras. I've also had a Holter they aren't fun and look like a comedic "wearing a wire" joke from a tv show. I didn't read your points on abortion just letting you know the law.
44. Sounds like old mate went to the Jason Falinski School of How to Behave at Polling Stations.
45. This attitude about potential policy concerns is not acceptable from a public political figure and it's both bold and appropriate that you asked for this information. Of course, these are hot-button issues for some, but if you are afraid of being asked to justify your opinion/potential policy stance about this as a politician (i.e. in the event that previously unknown information about tone position becomes public), you need to ask yourself why you're afraid of that. How is it ethically acceptable for a politician to support limiting rights while being secretive about (or unable to give) rationale for it? I'm also angered by the attitude of some politicians who feel they are not obligated to answer questions about their stance on issues. To be blunt about it, who the fuck do they think they work for? (Yeah, we all know some are pretty much working for lobbyists, but you know what I mean)
46. Man that sounds pretty thin skinned. Surely he realises the LNP will be torn to absolute shreds in parliament with a Labor opposition. Will the embarrasment/trauma be worth it for a single term?
47. Ask him how he feels about the rapist Caleb Kirby serving 0 jail time next time.
48. Ah yes, an LNP candidate (and respective office) being well out of place and rude to voters, how surprising
49. Me taking a huge reel to reel tape recorder to David Crisfullis office and denying I’m recording him, it’s just I am on the way to the recording studio and stopped in for a chat.
50. What you experienced is commonly referred to as red flags
51. Thank you for sharing this incident. I always had a very negative gut feeling about Watts. You’ve now confirmed it.
52. Thank you fortaking the time to publish this. Everyone needs to know it. I hope you're well now.
53. Why would I want to call someone to complain about something that a random person on the internet said happened?
54. Ha ha ha, I saw him at the Newtown and he bought me a beer
55. Bro give up it’s so over Trevor’s seat is rusted on and the LNP will form government Signed, A disappointed but not surprised resident
56. You sound like a male Karen. (Please note here I do no follow politics at all)
57. IANAL Afik in Qld you can record but not distribute without the participants permission. I *think* there is a provision regarding immediate danger or something along those lines.
58. I think it’s 50% of the parties are in agreeance to it?
59. Its not legal to publish secretly made recordings though. They can only be used in very specific situations.
60. So he's not changed, knew him many years ago and he was a knob then too.
61. as someone who takes audio memo's while out on a daily walk, this is very good to know xD
62. Not accurate. In QLD, recording a private conversation generally requires the consent of all parties involved under the *Invasion of Privacy Act 1971 (Qld)*. it is lawful in Queensland for a participant in a private conversation to record that conversation, even if the other person(s) involved do not know they are being recorded. Provided that the person doing the recording is a participant in the conversation, then no offence is committed. Noting, the legislation’s wording that it is unlawful without a lawful interest, but there are plenty of valid lawful interests. You can similar share it as long as you have a lawful reason to do so. Security cameras protect your property. Their intention is not to record private conversations. You’re fine
63. Yes, I'm familiar with the law around recording. You are allowed to distribute if you are a party in the conversation, and it was in a public space, or a place that the other person should reasonably expect privacy. But again, I wasn't recording, so his accusation was just insulting. Lol yeah, the holters suck. The ECG dots get so itchy after the first few hours too
64. The phone numbers are for people to complain about excessive mail, texts, or to remove themselves from the LNP's mailing and texts list. I'm not asking anyone to complain about my specific incisent
65. He's trying to buy your vote? Hopefully you're not that gullible. Of course a man on 170k a year can afford to buy you a beer. It's loose change to him.
66. Interesting how he bought you a drug. Which is also an extremely dangerous liquid poison directly linked to many health, societal and crime issues. Wonder if he supports legalising Cannabis, a substance with many health benefits - or if choosers of such would be "drug users" in his POV.
67. This or next election will likely be the last time they have tbar as a safe seat, though.
68. I know he's likely to retain his seat, but just thought I would share the experience since he was so rude to me. It's also helpful information for people who want to know how to get removed from their mailing and texts list.
69. Sounds like someone wanted a fight but didn't like what he got
70. No I think that being accused of something like that straight out from someone like that is very rude. All Trevor had to do is ask, "if you were recording" rather than accusing them saying 'i know you were recording' then I think OP wouldn't have been so offended. It's more about how you ask and talk to people that gets their goat.
71. Yea, I thought the same thing, post makes OP sound a little eccentric. They also know about some special trick to private your number. Defs is used to getting screened.
72. Yeah... I don't know of any two doctors that would agree to an abortion past 24 weeks without something serious happening. An abortion past 12 weeks often means over a week of bleeding and cramps and pain as well, no-one is doing that for fun I can assure you. I know a woman who had her baby die at the 28 weeks mark, and if it wasn't removed (abortion), she would have eventually become septic and died.
73. Buuut if you read the post, he wasn't recording. But if he was, he is allowed to.
74. One person in the conversation has to know about it. So that can be you if you’re talking to someone.
75. Referring to them as third party recording laws seems to be the easiest for most people to grasp. If you're a third party to the conversation (not part of the conversation) you're not allowed to record it. If you're not a third party (you're part of the conversation), you're allowed to record it.
76. I don't know if that's true - I've looked it up and gotten so many difference answers, it's information I would love to be certain about as all my phone calls are recorded. All I know is Queensland is one party consent state, so what happens when from some other state calls you? What if you call another state? Can you publish it? Let's say I work for a small business and a large business fucks me over and doesn't pay me for work done, can I publish a recording to make other people aware of this scumbag business? I hate how hard it can be to find answers to this shit.
77. As long as someone who is on the recording knows it’s being recorded you can legally do what ever the fuck you want with it. Phone calls however are different, you can record what ever you want but without all parties consent you can’t do anything with a recorded phone call.
78. If you were a party to a conversation it's my understanding that it's legal to record it even without informing the other party/parties. It's however not legal to record a conversation that you were not a party to, say by leaving your phone in a meeting room with a voice recorder running. How do I know? Had this exact discussion with a police officer who was running a judiciary meeting where the defendants were asked to leave the room and one of them left their phone behind.
79. Looks like the fascists are down voting you for the truth.....
80. Have warn a holter before. You’d have to be a fucking imbecile to think that someone would record you with something so bulky and obvious when mobile phones exist.
81. It also allows for publishing if it's in the public interest, which I'm guessing a political candidate talking about policy in a public space would meet the public interest test.
82. I came here to say this. He is a public figure in a public space (polling station). So even if you were recording him, you would have full legal right to post it.
83. He'll claim it as a campaign cost. Won't come out of his 170k
84. Hes on far more than 170k. Closer to 370k including super and allowances.
85. It's tax payers money, he should be buying everyone a beverage
86. I met him at Newtown park during one of his "meet the people" esc things he apparently does. All he seemed to care about was youth crime and how everything he talked about is the problem of youth crime or the fact that "the hospital hasn't been finished". Dodged questions on transgender issues and abortion because "the hospital needs to be finished first" and apparently housing price issues are due to an increase in repeat youth criminal offenders taking away funds that could be used for building more houses? I just got the impression he wanted to pick two topics that were famous enough he could tie anything into them and say whatever was needed to make himself seem a paladin of virtue. It just came across as very "Vote for me because you met me. Be honoured peasant, for you have met me!"
87. Likely to lmao Labor have put a nobody in I think that shows how they think that seats gonna go
88. You’re right; they only thing in between change in this city and 100,000 rusted LNP voters is some positive thinking on Reddit
