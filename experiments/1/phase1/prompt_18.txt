Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Just moved from there, thought it'd be an ideal spot. Close to airport and city. Has a bus hub, even though Toombul station is across the road there's an opportunity to have it's own station and platform directly above the creek. Next door to motorway tunnels too. Wasn't there when the shopping centre flooded but the mall looked in good nick, it was just the ground level even that wasn't too bad, so maybe an elevated structure and flood walls. Downside is Sandgate Rd is pretty rubbish for traffic, probably close second to Gympie Rd.
2. I fucking hope not
3. My first thought is traffic. Its shit there at the best of times. A stadium will devastate that area. Look, it a sound idea on paper. Would love to see more in relation to flood management, public transport and traffic management there
4. Gabba or bust!
5. It's got good public transport and the tunnels pop out right beside it, with the Gateway easily accessible by vehicle, and another station would be able to be looked at on the airport line right beside it to help with accessibility if it was required. Transport and traffic management isn't its largest issue, it would be flooding, but that is highly solvable with some very clever engineering and design, which progressive thinkers would probably love tbh.
6. Why don't we just cancel the Olympics and spend the money hospitals and housing etc?
7. 2032 olympics cancelled due to flooding
8. Nice, aquatic sports I guess?
9. It's an awful idea so we just might end up with this one knowing these guys.
10. It’s just that. A rumour. It’s going to Vic park. Toombul is going ahead as planned.
11. Libs promised no new stadia to be built. That is what a lot of LNP candidates were saying on tv on election night.
12. Vic Park, knocked down and rebuilt Gabba or the Hamilton private sector option should be the only options on the table. With Vic Park clearly ahead of the other two.
13. There's already a plan for the new centre. [https://brisbanedevelopment.com/prax-studio-unveils-conceptual-vision-for-toombul-shopping-centre/](https://brisbanedevelopment.com/prax-studio-unveils-conceptual-vision-for-toombul-shopping-centre/)
14. Unless they started planning two years ago, it is too late. We are running out of time they will go with quickest option.
15. Oh wow, love that idea. Close enough to town and rail and everything. If IKEA Logan can build on a flood plain, so can QG. Everybody looking for reasons to say No ... I vote Yes could work!
16. Definitely ideal for watersports. 😃
17. hahahahahahahhagaha really, On a flood plain, with shit access, and a road thats at least 4 x abouve capacity with the ONLY primary hi flow access to and from the airport. You cant make this shit up can ya hahahaha seriously hollywood should come to brisbane and write endless movies about these cowboys and their stupid fking ideas. The only thing toombul is good for is green space, throw in some solar power and a parking lot with a pedestrian flyover to the train station so people can park and ride en mass to the city, remove the stupid worthless bus stops and block the road access off sandgate expect to the airport to ensure correct traffic flow.
18. it would be a challenge that is for sure, the stadium can be built so as not to flood, but the areas around would also need to be improved so as to ensure people can get to events, as many have suggested on this thread, the area floods more regularly than the rest of Brisbane, a bit like Downey Park for example. Ironically there is a stadium ( a small one) at the end of Downey Park, Brisbane City Football Club.
19. Ah no. There's already a development application for the site.
20. It’ll be at Vic Park. Council plans have an area mapped off there saying ‘future development’. Some I know is a senior engineer at BCC and has said he’s 90% sure it’ll be there.
21. Nah. Too hard to get to for most people. Needs to be inner city
22. 7km is way too far from the city.
23. Victoria Park is clearly the best option. Just do it.
24. Victoria Park is the only option that makes any sense.
25. Good bot. Spot on.
26. Give a grant to nundah village to expand their shopping centre
27. Giving Developers millions to waste on a flood prone site, that will surely suffer significant construction delays and increased costs, for a stadium that will require high upkeep and repair costs from ongoing environmental damage? I can see the New state government going ahead with this plan 😉
28. https://preview.redd.it/a7zzxenhxcxd1.jpeg?width=678&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0eaf080610d3c26ca1a1ccec7dae2f0ebf61990c Go on… I’m listening.
29. Yeah the swimming will be happen in the stadium.
30. It's really not. I've long felt toombul was the best location for a stadium complex. A stadium in Brisbane has to be built off bedrock no matter where it is. Which means you can built the whole stadium elevated on columns. You raise the floor plate to the same level as toombul station then underneath is a floodwaters and giant carpark.
31. never stopped them building anywhere else in brisbane, it flooded there long before toombul was put in, thats why the airtrains up on bloody stilts.
32. Mate those are the objections of Greens councillors. At least the stated ones. LNP won’t care about that.
33. Infrastructure works at the scale of an Olympic venue can build up the land quite significantly, as well as shaping the geomorphology of the surrounding land to help mitigate risks. Folks need to remember that Sydney Olympic Park was built on reclaimed wetland in a lot of instances.
34. haha how hilarious would it be if the opening ceremony was flooded out though
35. Just build the stadium on stilts like a Qld’slander home
36. I have lived in the area for 15 years and let me say the flooding event that occurred in Feb 2022 was unlike anything I have ever seen in my lifetime. It was probably a 1 in 500 year event. The amount of rain that fell over that week was unlike anything I've ever seen in my life or probably ever will again. Anyway anyone who knows the area knows its no secret Kedron Brook occasionally breaks its banks but the water recedes quickly and it never once ever got close to the shopping centre. Building a stadium there and waterproofing the area is not a huge engineering feat in 2024. It would actually be a good solution to the problem.
37. ICAO are bringing in major changes to the OLS in the next few years, it's possible that the height restrictions could be lifted there- not likely in time for the stadium to be built, especially given how slow CASA is at adopting ICAO changes but could happen
38. You know the landing flight path goes right over the gateway bridge right? A stadium at Toombul would hardly be higher than the gateway. Not even close. So I doubt its an issue.
39. Thank you. I just want my Aldi and my Post Office back. Not some mega stadium shit-show.
40. Nundah has gone from a great subrub with heaps of amenities and services to an absolute isoalted shithole since Toombul closed. The woolworths carpark is a clusterfuck and the store now has so much demand that they are constantly sold out of products. Getting homewares is now an hour round trip to Chermside instead of the previous 10-15min trip to Toombul. We have lost a coles, an aldi, an eb games, a K-Mart, a bunch of reasturanuts and food court, a butchers, a fruit and veg market, banks, haridressers, cinema, multiple gyms ect ect and have had a population SURGE. Nundah is bursting at the seams with very little services to provide,.
41. The speed limit on Melton needs to be reduced to 40
42. I’d really appreciate a pet shop nearby, a discount store and a craft store. It would be hugely helpful. I also wish they’d put some shade on the walk to Nundah village it gets blisteringly hot in summer around Sandgate road and they cut down the only trees that offered a slither of shade Also a stadium would make everything really loud and bright and make scary drunk people come out
43. Yeah the Woolies in Nundah is an absolute joke, shelves are never stocked and extremely annoying carpark (pro tip, park underneath its easier). But agree with everything you say but it can be more than just a stadium at Toombul. Remember you can build up too. The whole site can have a stadium, a shopping centre, entertainment megacomplex. Its such a huge opportunity for the area and Brisbane itself. TOOMBUL is the first thing you see when travelling to the city from the airport. Its a very important site in terms of the image of the city.
44. I think OP is trying to start the rumour.
45. My lips are sealed. Watch this space.
46. Haha, exactly right? But seriously what's the first thing people see when getting a train or driving from the airport? Its Toombul. First impressions last. What an opportunity! To create and build an entertainment mega complex that will be the envy of Melbourne and Sydney.....and the world!
47. >The land is in the hands of private developers and is valuable. The new Government will probably love that 🤣
48. But are those private developers LNP donors…? If so they’ll probably get given double market rate for the land 😂
49. Its actually the perfect spot to showcase to the world. What's the first thing anyone see's when they leave BNE, they have to pass by Toombul whether by car or train. Its one of the first thing you see when come to Brisbane. First impressions last. Toombul is actually a very important site.
50. It doesn't have good access though
51. I'd be so much more enthusiastic about the Olympics if we could stage mock naval battles and gladiatorial bouts in the stadium. Might as well call it the Thunderdome, give it some local colour.
52. and traffic.
53. Any idea?
54. If only major construction works could reshape the land...
55. It also has a bus interchange station onsite.
56. Big, shared resources like the stadium \*should\* be toward the centre of the city, it's exactly the best use of that prime location. For what it's worth, I don't understand why having the stadium near the airport is valuable. The number of people who will fly into the airport, go straight to the ground, watch the footy/cricket then fly home without staying the night is... miniscule. Raising the floor height for a massive, heavy 60k stadium is not trivial.
57. Raising the ground level would just increase flooding in surrounding areas wouldn't it?
58. Finally someone with a brain. Its not a difficult engineering feat to build a stadium there.
59. You know you cant actually get onto the airport link there right, the trainstation is aged and decrepit, the roads are above capacity and behind in their design by 20 plus years... yeah excellent location.
60. yep, I'm sure a cheering crowd is heaps worse than the 5 main motorways/roads intersecting the area.
61. Who cares? Don't live in a capital city then.
62. As opposed to the airport (noise) and when the shopping centre was open/popular (traffic/lights)?
63. I also suggest that the Airport rail line, Sandgate Road and the roads associated with the Airport Link exit/East-West Arterial would probably be inside a security envelope for the stadium during the Olympics and likely would not be operational if a stadium was at the Toombul Site.
64.

65. Say it with me, MEGA ENTERTAINMENT COMPLEX. Shops, housing, cinemas, supermarkets, a stadium. We can have it all!
66. Why not just encompass the space of Allan Border Field, they don't really need 2 cricket fields side by side on a site where you can't obstruct too much of the flood waters that flows over the Raceway?
67. The traffic is really only bad during peak hours and as a local I can tell you nothing is worse than the traffic near Westfield Chermside (Gympie Rd) at practically any time of the day. Sandgate Rd doesn't even come close to that shit show.
68. The area DESPERATELY needs a shopping centre back though. We don't want a freaking stadium
69. Its no worse than the Gabba or suncorp and actually with the tunnel link entrance right there, along with the train line its actually perfect.
70. Literally the shittest place to build one.. surrounded by 4 main roads.. That will make traffic fun
71. Finally, a forward thinker. Someone positive. If they can create man made islands in the middle of the ocean, fixing a minor flooding problem at Toombul would be a piece of cake.
72. Vic Park Stadium can get fucked
73. This is not a plan. It was an initial vision, with no basis. There hasn’t even been an actual development application submitted yet
74. There's almost 8 years. Plenty of time, but yeah they need to get on it.
75. Yes for Jess Fox to win another Gold down Kedron Brook good idea!
76. Not an approved development yet, that’s why it’s just an application
77. Sure let me phone up my uncle at the BCC and get the details
78. Walking distance from Roma Street parklands and the CBD too.
79. There's a railway station right across the road. How is that hard to get to? There's problems with this idea, but transport isn't one of them.
80. Tell us how far away is Stade de France from Ile de la Cite?
81. Toombul was great for locals on the east side of the train tracks. Nundah is not great having to cross the one small bridge.
82. It's not just Nundah Village that needs expansion, the whole road infrastructure surrounding it is way too small and congested as is. The whole thing needs to be redone.
83. You can’t sit any more stuff there
84. Fuck me, that comment simultaneously got *increasingly worse* and *more correct* as it went on. Well done.
85. Then when the next government has to finish the build so that it's not only on time for the Olympics, but also able to withstand flood and weather damage, Libs will campaign on how much they had to overspend to make it happen.
86. Lang park floods as does the gabba
87. Well, they can build flood defences, build the stadium up above the flood plain, to be inline in the houses that don’t flood on the hill, plus it has direct access to the train network at toombul station
88. Wouldnt matter what fking goverment. Your kidding yourself if you think one party is any better than another. Its all about personal financial gain in australian politics.
89. That's a 1% AEP (1 in 100yr) river flood. Still not great but Toombul goes under in I believe 10% AEP (1 in 10 year) creek floods. Comparatively much much worse.
90. https://preview.redd.it/pfhotnn05exd1.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=512dd0a8711da1a0f5a4e534e6c6aba82579460b Just use the part that floods as the swimming pool.
91. Half of Brisbane was under water when that happened you goose. Toombul floods when someone sneezes
92. The flood water is easily mitigated with good planning.
93. Yeah I agree: if they can make the bottom few levels a car park, or something less sensitive to water, then it could work.
94. Cant see them having a stadium where you would have to cancel major events or risk everyones cars being flooded every time it rains.
95. Why? Do you drive? because if you do, surely your aware of how traffic ques up all the way down sangate road both directions (without toombul) When it was operating it was a carpark. Imagine with 50,000 people added to the mix. The olympics happen while people work, itd be chaos.
96. The air train is newer than Toombul was. Toombul turned 50 years old in 2017. RIP 🖤
97. Wouldn’t that make more residential areas on the Northside have an increase likelihood of their house flooding? I can’t see it being popular.
98. > Anyway anyone who knows the area knows its no secret Kedron Brook occasionally breaks its banks but the water recedes quickly and it never once ever got close to the shopping centre The shopping centre flooded to a depth of about 30-40cm inside in 2011 and then flooded again to a greater depth in 2022. It's one of the most flood prone sites in Brisbane and is significantly impacted by both riverine and creek flooding.
99. exactly, and any idiot that knows the airport knows that no aircraft of significant size would be at a low enough level to be significant risk at toombul anyway. The runways are parallell and aproach is configured way before toombul. only the idiot pigs in choppers fly without lights and nav lights low. if they hapoen to end up wiping themselves out on a reinforced concrete building, oh well, sad waste of a great helicopter.
100. CASA is a necessary but obstinate exercise in futility.
101. Even if the current regulations change, its pretty risky to build anything that would be as high as a stadium wound need to be.
102. We do have a post office across from Nundah Village but parking is far less convenient. I desperately wish we had another grocery store, Aldi is of course ideal due to the prices but even a Coles would be better than nothing. I occasionally walk to Woolworths if I don’t have a big shop or it’s not too hot. I tend to avoid driving there due to how much I hate the carpark, and I’ll go out of my way to Banyo or Ascot just to avoid it. With how many units keep being built in Nundah, and how car centric we still are, that Woolies can’t cope. Also the right turn lane right behind the turn lanes for Sandgate Road turns the area into a shit show between 3-6 PM most days.
103. You can have it all my friend and more. A 21st century entertainment mega complex!!! Its happening!!
104. Hey we still have gyms popping up on damn near every corner in Nundah, but agreed, we have little else and we're told to just "go to Chermside". I'm not going to the hassle of Chermside just to go to Kmart. Even though it was small, that Bunnings was great too. Hendra Hardware is too small, and sometimes I just can't be bothered to go to Virginia Bunnings.
105. I guess that's why real estate is booming there huh?
106. I always park on the bottom, I don't know why anyone parks in the surface spots. But the issue is getting to the bottom spots is a nightmare due to trying to navigate through the surface spots. People always parking in the loading zones, cars parked like shit so you can't drive two way traffic, nobody looking when they're backing out, people holding up the line trying to get in/out of spots. I tend to avoid driving there at all costs unless it's very late or very early.
107. “Many people are saying…”-type shit You made up this dumb idea. And yes it’s dumb, for all the reasons every other comment here has explained
108. Double? Think bigger my friend. We could go 10x and nobody could stop us!
109. Bus terminal built in already, train opposite, 100m from arterial tunnels and 2km from both international and domestic airports. How much better access do you need it to have bro?
110. Toombuldome, our own Venice every few years
111. I didn't get a reply lol They're probably not allowed to say..
112. I don't agree that it should be in the center. Eg Sydney Olympic Park isn't near the center. Sydney built and entire sports and entertainment precinct that works very well. But also neither is London Stadium, or Stade de France, or the Beijing Olympics Stadiums, or the Narendra Modi Stadium (the largest stadium in the world). The key thing is having accessible public transport. And as for people flying for events, they absolutely do. Because it's near the airport if you built an events complex, with restaurants and other nightlife venues, plus added hotels you will get a significant number of tourists coming in for those events. A Taylor Swift concert there for example would have a huge number of people flying in.
113. Yeah but those people with private jets to do exactly that have lots of influence.
114. Its also one of the first things you see when leaving the airport by car or rail. Its a very important site for the image of Brisbane itself.
115. You're increasing the height of the floor plate on pillars, not the height of the ground level. Effectively leaving flood water unimpeded. On a normal day, under the stadium would be a massive carpark, open on the sides. But at a time when flood was a risk, the gate to the carpark gets closed and if kedron brook does flood all that happens is water flows through the carpark underneath. It would have no effect on the operation of the stadium outside the loss of on site parking during the flooding event. Then after the flood you would just run through the space with a couple of bobcats to push the debris out and you're good to go. As for practically all you need to look at is how the airport rail line is constructed through that area. It's on pillars so that flood water can pass through without impacting the service.
116. Depends if the water can flow unimpeded underneath
117. The water there always recedes quickly like litterally within hours. Also that rain event in Feb 2022 was insane. Never seen anything like it in my life. Amost felt unnnatural. I doubt we'd see that again in our lifetime.
118. You can engineer anything but that doesn't mean you should. It's a problematic site with some major issues other than flooding.
119. Yes. You would build a new station on that line that was part of the development.
120. Yeah it is. A lot louder
121. This.
122. Toombul was dead by 7pm, not comparable.
123. No lol absolutely not, there are much better and more convenient spots for a stadium, toombul is not that.
124. I don’t want that. It sounds loud, crowded and bright
125. I was thinking that it could be integrated and form part of a precinct of sporting facilities in the area. If you look at the areas around the MCG and Homebush, you'll see a number of redundant playing facilities. They can be used by lower levels and community sporting groups ordinarily, and serve as a temporary location for the big teams when the stadium is being used for something else. I would also envisage a lot more open space around the venue to handle the crowd of those big events. For big events, lots of marquees and food trucks. Between then, it is just green space which would handle flood events better than the industrial area that is there now.
126. There's already one there
127. Sounds like a shitty place to put for main roads to me.
128. Yes, and excellent transport links.
129. The reason it floods as badly as it does is because it was created as a drainage canal system for places like Ascot and Clayfield that runs out to the Nudgee wetlands. So they could do anything realistically. From putting an actual drain in, to something out there like designing a reservoir or lock into the stadium's design.
130. 100% it's mad people thing that's a good idea. It would fuck up this city! I can't belive every olympic stadium post on reddit has people putting that as the best option.
131. How come?
132. Toombul and Nudgee are flood plains and flood prone. It's a ridiculous idea thinking something there would work bar lifting the whole area up 3 feet. I'm be doubtful this idea will even get past the here's a crazy idea group think stage. Cheers, C.
133. It will be approved. Certainly no way in hell a stadium will ever be built there, purely from a safety point of view. Edit: Wow, downvotes. Guess my 21 years of floodplain management means diddly squat.
134. Not as convenient as the Gabba where you can go in multiple directions on the train or bus. Anyone who is not Northside would have to catch the train back to the city then change.
135. I shouldn’t need to explain it. It needs to be central.
136. I humbly accept, and would like to give thanks to those who inspired me... Stephen King, Joe R Lansdale, and the Inventor of the word BLEAK. *
137. Your assessment of Australian politics is very valid! But I can jokingly criticise Coca Cola without having to list all the shit that's wrong with Pepsi, if you know what I mean?
138. I used to work at Toombul. Consistent heavy rain for 2 days is enough to make the bottom part of the site (which used to be car parks) flood. They could lift the site but given the amount of now expensive housing which would then flood instead I don’t think that will happen.
139. Toombul was always Brisbane's canary in the coal mine. It flooded before anything else.
140. True but I am assuming whatever the new development is - the flood level will be a carpark and whatever is being built will be above flood level
141. Funny part of the flooding at the old Toombul site, it had flooding earlier this year while they were doing the demo on the site.... 1 in 10 year events are closer to 1 in 5 at this point and 1 in 100 are getting closer to 1 in 50. There are sites that were built to only be effected by 1 in 100 year events that have gone under multiple times in the last 20 years. What ever gets built there needs stilts, yes there are still risks but at least the water course van flow.
