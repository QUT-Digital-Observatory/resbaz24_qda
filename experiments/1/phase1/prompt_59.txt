Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. >It was an absurd strategy misstep to focus on broadly unpopular, unrealistic, unimplimentable, economically illiterate federal policies. As an economist who's always voted 1 greens, this 100%. Talking about price caps just makes me roll my eyes and lose respect for them. That's teenage drama student daydream bullshit, not serious credible policy to fix real world problems. The greens need to realise that there are plenty of mainstream peer reviewed last century ideas on how to further socially progressive ideals that have actually been successfully put in place the world over. There's no need to promise to reinvent the wheel with more unicorn fairy dust sprinkled onto it every election. If that's the best economic policy proposal you could come up with, maybe it's best to shut up about the economy and stick to talking about climate change or whatever else you have people with actual qualifications for.
2. > Rent freezes, This is a state issue. DUH. The fed can't force the states to do a rent freeze, only encourage them.
3. >economically illiterate federal policies. I don't know if it was the state or federal greens who suggested that the govt control the interest rate, but whoever did it was an absolute moron. I personally know 4 prior greens voters who said they couldn't vote for a party who wants to take over the RBA.
4. I think you’re spot on
5. I find hard to believe that Sth Brisbane will stay with greens. The swing is 12% Last election greens only got that seat because the LNP picked them for preference vote.
6. I don’t think the Greens did anything particularly wrong, they just got seriously wedged this time around. I think loads of people who had been leaning either Greens or LNP a few weeks ago gravitated to Labor once the election became about protecting reproductive rights. Everything suddenly became very polarised for a lot of people and it left the Greens in no-man’s-land.
7. It was partly a poor policy presentation, but also ALP had amazing policies to support everyday households (state fuel stations, public school lunches etc). We also were offering gap-free GP visits, an increase of funding to public schools, supplemented Kindergarten and TAFE fees, as well as setting up a state bank with 1.5% lower mortgage rates than the big banks to force them to help out average Queenslanders. Also an increase of mining royalties etc.
8. Federal politics is on a knife edge. The green belt in Brisbane will fall. Chandler in Griffith and Watson in Ryan will both fall to the LNP. That will hand government to the LNP. The Greens are dead and buried. It's a good thing. We don't want the minority ruling the majority.
9. Yep. this had to be a big one. what does palestine have to do with the Greens?
10. Yep, and while noble, what exactly can one or two greens do about ending genocide on the other side of the world. Fucking nothing. Sadly.
11. I know exactly how unpopular this opinion is on this board, but if you honestly care more about your roads than your government funding/ arming genocide, - to the point where you constantly mock people for prioritising the latter, I have very little sympathy for you not getting the urban policy you want. Besides which I don't actually think state Greens candidates/ campaigner were talking about Palestine. Max has been, but he's a federal MP. Personally, I'm not even affiliated with the Greens, I'm just some random guy who is happy to vote for them as long as they remain on the right side of these issues. Cannot comprehend why social capitalist liberals like yourself are constantly blaming people like me, rather than people with actual power (Jim Chalmers, Albanese, Penny Wong) for not doing something that would probably be popular on balance (even if most Australians don't care that much) for the electoral fortunes of mediocre red liberal parties.
12. This is entirely their failing point. The greens policies are almost always set as some lofty ambition, likely to gain attention from voters, but voters know that they aren't able to actually enact any of those policies unless they're in government. Which they never will be. So their policies mean absolutely nothing, and they're unwilling to compromise on them to make any traction at all. It's entirely self defeating, with only themselves to blame for it
13. So well said! (From another working class traitor who despairs at the class snobbery and cliques in the environment movement, that prevent us from achieving better outcomes for the environment)
14. I feel like you should run
15. Had a similar experience in my brief time as an active member. You should run as an independent. I'd help you out.
16. Hard agree on everything you said. My overarching gripe with the Greens is they are not grounded in dealing with the world and people as they are - it's 100% my idealistic way or nothing at all. And so the result is nothing changes. There is a lack of understanding that they need to operate in the real world and that involves comprise to make progress. I saw a post from the Greens (maybe on here?) griping about Labor introducing watered-down version of their policies and I couldn't believe it was a complaint. Like... That's a win? That's exactly what you should want, that's your current role in the system and making some ground is better than none at all. Plus it makes the next step to the left a little closer and easier to take. Incremental change is change, and it's lot easier to get people on board with and make happen.
17. "intersectionality and mircoaggressions" what are you talking about? Are you referencing anything in particular?
18. Pretty much what the Greens do in most electorates. They have a natural ceiling
19. check your dms please
20. Pre poll and postal, which have significantly prefer LNP. This is why a lot of previously called labor seats are now LNP gains.
21. It's looks like he's keeping Maiwar
22. This. People don't appreciate it when the sitting government tries to enact policy only to have it blocked simply because it doesn't do enough. Something is better than nothing. Greens will keep losing if they don't learn this.
23. I campaigned for Labor in the last two weeks across Cooper, McConnell and Maiwar. This was definitely the conversations I had with the Green's voters swapping to Labor.
24. People not having full equity of their homes is a horrible idea even worse than having expensive homes but with full ownership.
25. Idk, with the LNP winning, people have voted AGAINST cost of living relief. So idk if the greens wanting a better version of the HAFF is the reason.
26. Unfortunately, based on Berkman's "victory" speech, they're in full denial on that, so they're going to keep suffering if they don't help pass good policy federally.
27. The Help to Buy scheme is what you're referring to right? Have you had a look at the policy? Because if you have you'd know its an atrociously ineffective scheme. You're probably right that they were punished for not letting it pass, but passing it off as good is just misinformation. The scheme itself would enable home ownership for such a slim demographic of people as to make it completely useless for solving the housing crisis. The people it does help into home ownership are going to be deeply so entrenched in debt; likely meaning housing prices will increase even further as resistance to selling will increase. Normally I wouldn't care over someone just misrepresenting a bill; but the housing crisis has caused so much damage to this country that I'm sorry but I feel I have to point that out.
28. Good? Wake up.
29. Quite contrary, Sriranganathan's lord mayor campaign was the best result the Greens had yet in local elections. The drop in impetus for The Greens and votes for them is simply because Labor's policies had largely caught up to them in progressiveness under Miles so for progressives The Greens stopped being the only option. They needed to better differentiate themselves and Berkman was not listening to people like Sriranganthan on this matter. Also Berkman's ridiculous state owned mining company proposals spat in the face of environmentalism and weren't in line with the intent of decolonisation efforts in the party, taking regional wealth out of the Indigenous communities having their land exploited and putting it into the rest of the state. The Greens didn't go far enough and Labor met them, so Labor soaked up their votes.
30. And yet, with Sriranganathan running as their candidate for LM, Greens saw their biggest swings in the recent council election. As for genuine policies, how long have the Greens campaigned for free public transport?
31. Sri was very divisive but always seemed genuine to me I don't get that vibe from Max
32. > Yes it would be lovely to tax every big company 100% of their profits and we all get free everything forever and ever and sing Kumbaya on Queen Street but that's not real life. Can you show the Greens policy that actually suggests this? > They need to cut out the weirdos like Sri who seems to be happier as a militant than a politician and come up with some genuine policies that don't revolve around fantasy and are actually viable. What policies do you feel are pure fantasy?
33. Sri was an excellent councillor for The Gabba ward. May have had some wacky political ideals but they never seemed to take away from him showing consistent genuine care for his community.
34. And fair call too because the "Bob Brown Greens" actually had some substance, not the shit show we see from them today. The greens have made themselves irrelevant, protesting anything and everything so its actually impossible for the regular person to support them without feeling at conflict and excluded as well.
35. But that’s the point, isn’t it? In an election where there is a huge drop in ALP votes, the Greens were unable to pick up any of those votes. Of the votes that were up for grabs, none of them went to the Greens. Being the party of protest gives you a floor, but it also imposes a ceiling on how many votes the Greens can ever attract.
36. You make a good point
37. The greens hardly even push palestine. WTF are you talking about?
38. Imagine thinking that we shouldn't all care about stopping apartheid, war crimes, and genocide.
39. Labor policies felt like a Green platform this election. And because the outcome was going to be at the very best a narrow win for Labor, some people might not have wanted to give Greens the balance of power. Personally, I’m still salty over the whole Gabba situation, and the Greens are a little too gleeful in their role in turning that into a shitshow.
40. [deleted]
41. Labor won Greens votes because Labor adopted popular Greens policies. Not because Queenslanders don't understand preferential voting. > people who are usually Green voters voted for Labor out of fear of LNP, and a lot of people also fell for the "a vote for the Greens is a wasted vote/vote for LNP" rhetoric because that's what Labor constantly says. I have never heard this on here, or anywhere else. > And it works apparently because I literally saw a bunch of comments on here saying "I usually vote Greens but I'm so scared LNP will get in I'm gonna vote Labor" Again, I saw no such comments. Or maybe one or two, very rarely, that were immediately swamped by other users explaining preferential voting. Pretty wild to pretend the Greens could have a massive swing against them based on that. > and I know Labor people who say this sort of shit constantly too. No you don't. > So misrepresenting the prefential voting system is effective in convincing all the noobs who don't know better to vote for them. Sorry I'm calling bullshit on all of this.
42. They really booted Palasczuk
43. Sriranganathan is not in charge of Queensland Greens and Miles is even more militant and progressive than Berkmann is, which drew votes back to Labor from The Greens.
44. > Because being a militant ideologue is not attractive to most people Yet we have LNP in power, with the christian right pushing for abortion bans.
45. None of this is true. The “big houses with yards” thing is something the LNP council did when they banned medium-density building almost everywhere in ~2018! This is just completely untrue. YES in my backyard! Please 😭 Go and look at their council campaign platform if you don’t believe me.
46. Playing university politics that don't work in the real world too
47. Have any actual examples beyond your pithy little soundbite?
48. But did you vote for a minor party?
49. Agree. That’s why I voted Green in my seat that they should have won. (Greenslopes). They failed. We need some representation other than the major 2 to balance this country. I definitely don’t agree with a lot of what they say. Same as both majors.
50. Literally the opposite of what happens. More minor parties = the status quo being even more status quo. The major parties refuse to negotiate and nothing gets done.
51. Exactly, their policies are immature.
52. Why are rent caps “batshit insane” and not “realistic”? The ACT has rent caps, landlords there can only increase rents by a maximum of CPI + 10% of CPI. Queensland could do the exact same thing, don’t even have to fully draft the bill for parliament just copy and paste. For example, this is how it *actually* works in the ACT right now… In the scenario of a tenancy starting 1st Jan 2023 and the rent increase 1st Jan 2024, and weekly rent of $500: At the start of your tenancy, the most recent CPI data was from 2022-Q4. At this time the CPI for Canberra rents was 120. The most recent CPI data from the date of the rental increase is 2023-Q4, at which time the CPI was 122.9. This gives a percentage difference of 2.42%. To find the maximum allowable change, we multiply by 110%, which is 2.66%. If your rent was previously $500 a week, it would only be able to go to a new maximum of $513 a week.
53. That’s pretty much it.
54. Is this actually true? I've never heard them mention Palestine once during their entire campaign
55. Labor did well to go with that. They turned a landslide into a narrow victory by LNP
56. Evidence?
57. You are pro genocide? That's really fucked up. (The Zionists are clearly out in full swing. Support of Palestine isn't support of terrorism, that's so fucking stupid. I know critical thinking is difficult for nationalists)
58. Yeah so 1 seat instead of their predicted 5
59. I hate this "a party can't govern because they have no experience governing" argument. It stinks of "entry job available: minimum requirement 3 years experience" type of expectations. How does a party get experience governing if its not elected to govern in the first place? Its not even necessarily Greens specific. If everyone followed that reasoning then may as well only ever have two parties. What a ridiculous expectation. I think we also capable of understanding the opposite as well that a party with experience governing can do a shit job too. Edit: Ah I just saw another of your comments calling the Greens communists and wanting to control all of government. Maybe too much to expect rational reasoning
60. I don’t give a shit about regional Queenslands farms. All we have to do is wait 4 years and they will want the LNP gone anyway.
61. Oh, do the Greens not have a solid set of environmental policies?
62. wtf you on about lad. This is the Brisbane sub. It’s for anyone and everything. And I voted green in my seat ya muppet. They fucked up. I’m curious on what people think.
63. Exactly. They're communists who want big government and big welfare. Australia is built on humanist liberalist principles. Not humanist socialist principles. Aspiration is good. Not government control of human endeavour. This is what the Greens want. Control by government.
64. Have you got an example RK?
65. Yeah she was horrendous I agree. The carry on with the school next to the Gabba was fkn embarrassing.
66. Agree 100%. He’s a huge problem for them. He won’t get reelected. One hit wonder. He had a chance to set himself up, but he’s failed so badly. It’s bizarre to see it.
67. I don't understand these complaints, the progressive labour government took all of the good ideas from the greens like how labour co-opted free public transport to 50c fares, or free lunches and breakfasts to just free breakfasts. And yet people hate the greens because their policies are unreasonable? Make that make sense to me.
68. the country is built on socialist agendas mate. they're programs we constantly rely on, take advantage of, and want the government to take care of and expand
69. Show me how they’ve been anti-Semitic? Being critical of the Israel government is not the same as being anti-Semitic and it’s dangerous to suggest that it is.
70. Or reddit skews younger and we quite dislike the LNP?
71. 😂 You know someone doesn't understand a comment purely from a downvote. That's impressive.
72. In reality, the possible impacts on abortion access are very real and this affects regional women even when its legalised. Forcing women to bear children (whether by law or access) entrenches poverty which in turn drives crime and creates an underclass. Legalisation in Qld was only a few years back and we haven't even had the chance to address access in the regions. Any greyness in the way our government addresses this issue will make investment and culture shift even less likely. Honestly, this is a terrible day. Not saying there aren't bigger reasons for why the Greens tanked but I do think they are making a big mistake by ignoring the regions.
73. Not gaining one seat is definitely a shift away. Regardless of what you think. One Nation are barely behind the Greens in this result and almost everyone views them as irrelevant. The Greens are on their way to irrelevance as well if they don’t change very quickly.
74. Like "adult crime adult time"?
75. With respect, you are too young to know hardly anything about them over the last few decades. In 20 years you can comment on their past.
76. How did they do that? What’s an example
77. How do you come to that conclusion in a preferential voting system?
78. Have never governed and wouldn't know how to. They are anti democratic, hoping to nab the balance of power so the minority can tell the majority what to do.
79. Tim we get it you got 2-3 kids we're happy for ya mate no need to keep telling everyone
80. >Good bye woke culture Is the woke culture in the room with you right now?
81. Your comment is a key example of why we need to better fund our education system
82. Is everything you don't like or understand woke?
83. 😂 Look I’m happy the greens flopped as well but this is a silly comment. Ultimately I think the Greens let perfection be the enemy of good. Max is certainly a divisive figure himself and I think now Federal greens should be very worried. Federal Labor too should be alarmed
84. Don’t behave inappropriately. Have some respect for yourself and our community.
85. McMahon?
86. Which also shows they fundamentally misunderstand how preferential voting works.
87. That's what I was thinking as well because I know a few greens voters who did this.
88. I think there are probably decent amounts of ALP first preference voters who put the LNP second because they feel safer with a major party?
89. Most people don't decide based on one party being fractionally more in one direction on an esoteric scale of left to right, they see 2 parties that largely espouse ideas they agree with and pick the one that's more committed to and capable of implementing those policies.
90. I think you are on to something, I think the majority of the Greens voters are (small 'l') liberals who want economic fatness (at no risk to themselves) and action on climate change but are otherwise pretty happy with the status quo. While internally the party has a significant more who would like to see the current economic and geo-political status quo dismantled.
91. I communicated poorly, sorry. Housing affordability and inflation are viewed as federal issues. Rent and grocery caps can be implemented at a state level, but voters look to their state reps to address issues with schools, hospitals, roads, city planning, and basic infrastructure, not issues with the national economy. Edit: this is doubly true if their state rep is from a minor party - inner city wine mums and young working professionals aren't voting for Michael Berkman to fix the national econony. They vote for Michael Berkman to push for new parks, schools, public transport investment, and push against shit like a zipline in Mt Cootha forest.
92. The chance that the Greens have in South Brisbane is that the LNP are only slightly behind Labor and might leapfrog them into 2nd on One Nation preferences, in which case the final count would be Green v LNP (which Greens win) rather than Green v Labor (which Labor win). It’s not likely at this stage, but possible.
93. Griffith will never go LNP, they were under 40% 2PP vs both Labor and Greens. If the Greens lose the seat it'll be back to Labor. Ryan could go LNP, though.
94. Griffith is traditionally a Labor seat. Why would it magical turn conservative ? 🥴
95. If the greens primary vote stays this high in this area. The LNP can just preference switch every time and wipe out the sitting candidate.
96. The down votes are delicious. Struck a nerve with the watermelons residing in the subreddit. 😂
97. Idk maybe we don’t like supporting genocide 🤷🏼‍♀️
98. Perhaps we have empathy for fellow human beings and want to see a genocide against them stopped?
99. “your government funding/ arming genocide” The QLD state government is doing that? Do you have a source for that?
100. These accounts writing inflammatory posts like this can't be human. God I hope you're a bot account and not an adult who votes
101. Well said
102. Too many skeletons in my closet and the unfortunate tendency to swear under pressure and call myself a queer commie.
103. Yeah I suspect that's a lot of my discomfort - I tend to be pragmatic and logistical, and even where I do agree with policy I wanna know how and what will happen. The "those are our policies" is...it drives me mental. Good! They're good policy! We can also shift the Overton window!
104. Mostly the way in which language become activism in political circles - I'm not gonna correct someone calling me Miss rather than Dr, or explain to them I have a PhD, or why it's important. Because I do understand all of that, it's just irrelevant in the context of outreach. Same with a lot of those things. I don't have a whole lot of interest telling people about intersectional concerns for youth crime, right? It's irrelevant. Asking for empathy doesn't require *any* theory. Shit, you don't even need to bring up research a lot of the time. Like I've got a mate who, when we were talking, said "women care a lot about those kinds of things" when it came to home decor and shit, and was surprised the day I wandered off to go sit down while he and my partner shopped as that's usually a "boy thing". I could 'educate' him or whatever, or I could just...accept that and enjoy his company, including that he is super accepting of me, queer people, trans people, and so on. And has a bunch of knowledge I don't about disability, race, and masculinity.
105. Are these numbers not included in the tally as they are counted though? Or do you mean the ~80% ALP to LNP preference is the bit that is no longer valid and is doing all the heavy-lifting for LNP's 2PP?
106. They think they can fix all of Australia’s problems in one single go, they need to move away from that mindset
107. > Something is better than nothing. Except the items that they keep blocking could never realistically be called something, we should be happily celebrating the Greens for blocking shit policy and fighting for it to actually do anything. They aren't fighting for perfect, they're fighting for the things put forward to even begin approaching good instead of just being legislation for the sake of looking like Labor is doing something, while fundamentally doing nothing to actually address issues.
108. Hopefully, the Federal Greens will read the room, sit down with Labor, and start working towards getting some progressive legislation through parliament. If they don't, it'll just be another four years wasted on posturing.
109. On the Greens side doing data entry and I definitely noted from our doorknock notes that voters were becoming more negative about the Greens in the last month.
110. I don't think that's fully accurate. People have voted against Labor's approach to dealing with these issues. They want better management of these issues. Because in reality some people are so far behind the 8 ball that a couple of thousand dollars spread over these initiatives doesn't make much difference. They want policies that actually reduce the likelihood of needing cost of living support, not a bandaid fix.
111. Berkman claiming that Labor attacked them this election when they very much did not really put me off him tbh.
