Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Yeah and he said he believes in a woman's right to chose. However voted against the abortion legislation when it was up for a vote. The LNP have always preferred private consultancy's, over the public service. Because the consultants will do exactly what their paid to do. While the public service will work in the public interest over the Parties interest.
2. I've got a special offer just for you: the Story Bridge for just $1!
3. Because you assume the kids won’t be white say it!
4. That's the "rusted-on" LNP vote, not the swing vote that has clearly swung from the last election. Those are the people who are vulnerable to hype from both sides, and those are the people the top comment is saying will "find out".
5. Maybe there are also baby boomers who are for it not against it because they have children who have had to make a decision to terminate a pregnancy and supported them through it. They might be more forward thinking than given credit for and support women's rights. The whitewash opinion "all baby boomers are shit" is old and a bit insulting.
6. I think we forget that the demographics have daughters, granddaughters, DILs, nieces etc, so potential anti-abortion laws will impact them even indirectly, though it's not a relief of course. It just will be too late to change anything.
7. If you’re UQ, look into Odin Pass. It’s currently unavailable because it’s pointless with 50c fares, but it’d be essential otherwise. Sadly, only UQ can get it - USC, USQ, QUT, Griffith just have to suck it up.
8. Much appreciated ❤️
9. We're worried they'll be made to cost money to address the ramping issues. Essentially making poor people decide whether the pain in their chest is "really that bad".
10. There's been talk of privatising them
11. Yes and no. The federal government schedules drugs, which controls general access, but the states can further control them - medicinal cannabis is a good example of this. It is possible for the state government to ban a drug that is federally legal such as MS-2 Step. I’m not convinced it’s *likely*, mind you. That said - if they restore the original wording of the Criminal Code Act, you’re fucked.
12. Yeaaah, definitely not calling out for an ambulance ever then, I don't drive and I'm well and truly under the poverty line, I guess I'm shit outta luck, right?
13. Ambulances are free at the moment, yeah, but there's been talk of them getting privatised. And if women's reproductive rights get taken away from them, as many are scared it will be, it might be possible that the pill could eventually be on the chopping block, so to speak. That medicine is used to regulate hormones as well, which is a major form of treatment for one of my disorders.
14. You do realise only one other state has free ambulances? You are deluded. We are privileged to be protected from having to pay fees for calling an ambulance anywhere in Australia by QAS. Queensland actually pays our ambulance bills anytime we get one - if you call 000 in NSW, Victoria, or Norfolk Island, QAS gets an invoice. It can be tens of thousands of dollars if it was from Norfolk Island, and required medevac. Right now, the government just pays it. No cost to you. Australia is more American than you think, and you know nothing because Labor governments have fought hard over the years to stop LNP governments from stripping those privileges away from you.
15. Fuck Murdoch. And Costello. Or whoever replaced him. And Packer.
16. police-sanctioned rallies serve to foster a sense of community, solidarity, and conviction. in this case, it also reminds us to be vigilant because our rights can always be stripped away. it's also a demonstration of shared values.
17. The people who put LNP first (42% of all first preference votes) don't have values in accordance with today's standards? Interesting.
18. They will go in dry and keep you ramped for 18 hours before you can get medical care for your bleeding ass hole.
19. Agree, however had it been a hung parliament KAP would have had some huge pull. Irrelevant now though like you said.
20. Thanks. Definitely never a good idea to not give a direct answer on a question like that.
21. The LNP have clearly stated no such thing, and DC has refused over 100 times to rule out forcing a party line vote to block Katter’s bill. Combined with the fact that he opposed decriminalisation, and it’s well known that many in the LNP opposed it, if Katter’s bill came up in a majority LNP parliament, it would likely succeed. The only spin here is your lies and disinformation.
22. They will die out soon enough. I'm gen y and luckily pretty comfortable, few of Labor's proposed policies effect me but I loved what Miles was doing, because I care about my community more than policies that will directly help me out. I'd like to think that there's more gen y's, z's etc that will act less selfishly going forward when they aren't the ones necessarily directly benefitting. I hope the retirees of the decades to come remember how repulsed a lot of us were by boomers and don't repeat history.
23. Perth is set for an NRL team, maybe I'll move over when that happens
24. The 2007 federal election was widely called a landslide at the time, and that was only 53-47.
25. Absolutely no one was expecting a Newman level wipeout. That will never happen again.
26. State based civil unions and equal age of consent are both things Labor legislated that they can overturn
27. Labour have to bite the bullet and appear more socially conservative to appeal to their base. Currently they only really appeal to a handful of University kids and upper middle class white people. The low IQ poor majority don't care about the social politics they care about safety and comfort like all plebs in all history always have.
28. FFS
29. “It’s not part of our plan” Janetzki answered precisely zero questions.
30. Protest is a valid part of the democratic process. Rioting, however, is not.
31. Also if I remember correctly, last time this went for a vote, only THREE LNP members voted for abortion to no longer be a crime. David was one of them who STILL wanted abortion to be a crime, but his stance seems so strange on it, he's pro-choice, but wants late term abortion criminalised? People who are getting late term abortions aren't doing it for shits and giggles..
32. IF they allow to go to a vote. They don’t have to. That’s what a majority government can do in this state. Just like labor changed the preferential voting rules. 18 minutes from proposed to voted on. Done. The lnp have said they won’t change the law on abortion. And the have the numbers to back that position up. Katter can’t do shit.
33. Is it a case of rose tinted glasses. None of those stats paint a “good” picture. Why are we so worse off than other states. We don’t make as much and we pay just about the top. That doesn’t add up to a good running of things - is that fair to say?
34. Surprise, blow in with absolutely nothing to say praising the LNP is talking shit. News at 7, wait don't watch the news. Please I beg of you.
35. Yes - we are the 4th or 5th best as you said. Hence 2nd or 3rd most expensive… which likes up exactly with what I said. lol… My stats literally come from the first source on google if you type cost of living Australian states.
36. Like all LNP cronies they probably got it from Sunrise
37. Yes, but have you gone through the process of getting permission to protest etc?
38. ConsciENCE vote
39. I didn't know they were pro israel
40. dont think so, everythings going to be the same darl
41. Worked with her directly plenty of times, she was great for the community and actively took part in improving it and fighting for south Brisbane. Her and her people were great for the area before the car crash
42. The majority of the state supported it at the time and would support that kind of action again. Labor received an increased majority in 2020 following those actions. I know it's hard to hear but your view is not popular and people decided keeping the community safe was more important than an individual's right to attend a funeral.
43. A lot of people have relatives who are alive today because of those decisions that otherwise wouldn’t be. Fuck off with your “audacity” bullshit - people would genuinely empathise with your position because, truly, it was a shit one and for me personally I’m sorry you had to go through that, but lives were saved because of it. Could there have been more empathy in an exemption process, managed in such a way to ensure public safety but also respect people’s needs? Abso-fucking-lutely. But you’re going to get shitcanned when you say Labor failed COVID management because _they didn’t_. Also, fuck you for supporting the LNP who will absolutely sell out our state and roll back individual rights.
44. They’re all butthurt lefties who tried to sway the election with scare tactics and false narratives over the last few weeks here in this sub. It didn’t work. ALP lost fair and square. Deal with it like adults. Nearly need to leave a box of tissues here for you all.
45.

46. Abusing someone for having a differing view to yourself, that doesn’t seem healthy. Head outside and get some vitamin B, it’s good for the body and mind.
47. Katter confirmed last night on ABC he's still coming for abortion.
48. Ok so Bob Katter said that... not the LNP. So my original comment stands as does your paranoia
49. LNP has a slim majority and is made up of both social progressives and social conservatives. Even if a conscience vote is allowed, there are too many progressives for the vote to get up. I don’t understand why people are freaking out over this.
50. Exactly.. it was Katter. Not the LNP. The LNP would surely know its political suicide to try and change that.
51. I highly doubt they are going to risk another term by doing this. The topic was thrust on them, not brought up by them.
52. [removed]
53. Thanks
54. Good insult shit head 💀, Definitely not smart enough to know what Ad hominem is
55. There was a place in the valley called the family planning clinic.
56. 50 is a gen X. Be careful who you call out.
57. Cooker thinks the world is flat.
58. Just google the definition bud. Google is your friend.
59. they are a moron trying to launder far right talking points, that is their aim
60. not my list - it's from [Countries Where Abortion Is Illegal 2024](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/countries-where-abortion-is-illegal) but point was to highlight that the USA doesn't "ban" it. that's a falsity (even though OP didn't explicitly state it) and that other countries do - so if one is unhappy with the USA the one should be more unhappy with those countries and say so.
61. The great stripping of online comments begins it seems… 😂😁
62. Tim Nicholls Clayfield voted with Labour for decrim. I dont know who the other two were
63. Oh that's right she got voted out 2020 but was in before that! I totally forgot that. I used to live in that seat and voted against her twice I should remember lol. In that case maybe she's not as moderate as I thought. I'm glad you dug into that.
64. Is that the first time an election promise has been broken before the election even happened? Lol
65. Youth crime is already falling. If you look at the actual statistics it’s the lowest it’s been in 20 years. My partner is a police officer and he agrees it’s not an issue. Each area may have a few kids who cause the ‘majority’ of youth crime. It’s not as out of control as the media makes out. So it will ‘fall’ and he won’t need to resign. Empty promise to make.
66. > if youth crime doesn't fall It's been falling 'per capita' for a decade or so, but not in raw numbers - we've been growing faster than it's falling. Couldn't have that come out too early in the campaign though.
67. At least he back-pedalled before the election, not after it.
68. We’re talking about two different people here. You’re talking about David.
69. No he hasn’t. Stop falling for BS
70. For all the complaints about Senate obstruction there is value in having one when it comes to removing the extremes from the legislation process
71. Whoever the fuck decided fixed 4 year terms in a parliament with 1 chamber is a good idea is absolutely nuts. Oh wait, it was the whole of qld 💀
72. Doubtful, LNP is the conscious vote party unlike Labor
73. You could see how bitter she was
74. Did you catch when she had to stop talking and change what she was about to say?
75. Amanda Stoker also got pissed at abc questions about abortion. They thanked her for her time she she said "seeya!" with what I thought was a menacing smile lol
76. There are US evangelicals that directly fund anti-abortion groups here. It's not just that the locals are 'inspired' by the US precedents.
77. In America you can safe drop your child, no questions asked. Here you go to jail for 7 years. If they are going to make abortion illegal they need to make child safe drop legal.
78. I don’t get it, abortion laws don’t affect those that disagree because those that don’t agree with abortion can still go ahead with their pregnancies! And like my hubby says, no man gets a say in a woman’s body decisions… why is this so hard to understand in the 21st century
79. Let the north go. Seriously become its own state. In fact I’ll help with the campaigning.
80. A person I spoke to yesterday said it best - you can’t criminalise abortion, you can only criminalise _safe_ abortion.
81. No it would be Katter's can't you read? It's like a baby bird as long as I get it in there before it sees me it will imprint on him when he goes to grab the paper.
82. If I have twins you get the second, friend.
83. The particular brand of copium I'm on today is telling me they didn't want to commit either way in case they needed KAP support to form government. But time will tell I guess
84. This. Honestly think the olympics are heavily outdated
85. By cancel the Olympics did you mean push all the budget blowouts to shell and construction companies associated with them and their friends? If so you would be correct. How people can’t see a pattern that’s happened 100x times before with this party I’ll never know
86. It should be taught in high school along with things like taxation and life skills. ... In a perfect world
87. Ummm. Nah. [Economic and Fiscal Overview - Queensland Budget 2024-25](https://budget.qld.gov.au/overview/economic-and-fiscal-overview/#:~:text=RESPONSIBLE%20BUDGET%20MANAGEMENT%20%E2%80%93%20FISCAL%20OVERVIEW&text=A%20strong%20net%20operating%20surplus,in%20the%202023%E2%80%9324%20Budget.) >**A strong net operating surplus of $564 million is expected for 2023–24 compared to the deficit of $2.182 billion estimated in the 2023–24 Budget**. This estimated outcome is the result of careful management of revenue improvements, including royalties and taxes, so that a surplus has been achieved at the same time as providing additional electricity bill support for Queensland households and small businesses in 2024–25. **The 2023–24 estimated actual represents the third consecutive operating surplus of this term of government and follows a record surplus of $13.9 billion in 2022–23.**
88. hey hey, boomsauce is back getting basic facts wrong again everyone!
89. Wow, running a state is expensive! Who'd have thought? And I wonder how that could be paid back? Maybe with some of the ~8bn/yr from royalties? Jesus Christ you people love to wank off over capitalism, but apparently only private sector concerns can do things like take out loans and get finance for things. The moment the public sector does it, you piss your pants and squeal like someone stole your copy of Atlas Shrugged.
90. Thanks for taking the time to reply, and with all that info too. Yeah that makes a lot more sense. Yeah I agree it would seem a bit mad to touch those higher surcharges, well particularly the $300 one. At least at that point both the mining companies and the government would be making big money, win for everybody. Actually makes me wonder if they’d have to raise the levels of those lower thresholds ($150 and $175) eventually if there was cost inflation and production costs started to rise towards those levels. I guess it could make sense to leave them for thermal coal if a government wants to phase that out eventually, but presumably Queensland will want to keep exporting met coal for a long time yet.
91. There's a lot of dumb reactionary bogans who genuinely vote directly against their self interest though :S
92. Sadly you are probably 100% on the money. Another sign of the 2 tier society we are now living in where those that won’t notice and voted for this will at worse walk away with even more (just a little though), where as those that can’t afford to live, will find it harder and harder as the rich start pulling back any support they may have given to ensure the “user pays” system comes into effect.
93. Except that's not how parliamentary debate happens. The only way something comes up for debate and vote is if the manager of government business and/or the speaker allows it to be. It would only happen if the powers that be within the Coalition government want it. Only THEN do the members of the coalition have the freedom to vote according to the conscience, if that's what the party decides is appropriate in the situation.
94. Time to make a change where SEQ doesn't pay for NQ choices and SPLIT QUEENSLAND https://www.reddit.com/r/queensland/s/2KUNEmXAnZ
95. There is very little the state gov can do to ease the cost of living. The main cause is inflation and that's part of a global issue with the reserve bank and feral govt holding some levers to try to control it. The tough times we are facing at all from the Covid lockdowns and all the money that was printed. The consequences of those lockdowns is now being fully felt. The next couple years will be tough no matter who is in govt.
96. Likely, but I think Labor won't bounce back that hard, because they lost a lot of margin fat but not many seats. Hopefully it's not Newman 2.0 (but Crisafulli can't possibly be that dumb, when his whole campaign was we won't be that dumb). Their best bet is to be incremental, establish that they can govern on a few promises and deal with whatever policy curve ball hits this term. The one advantage they have is that they under promised like crazy and still snuck home, which could be a boon in disguise for them, because the more vocal ideologues can now be shit down by moderates if they exist. Ironically, I think their blueprint for the next four years is not that dissimilar to who they kicked out - softly, slowly and deliberately, without boasting. The more you try to beat on the other side, the worse it will get, because they can just say you don't remember how to govern.
97. That and their pet newspapers will tell people they've fixed the problem. It's politics on easy mode.
98. Labor’s response that crime had decreased is disingenuous though and that’s the problem. It’s not down, it’s down in some areas, but it’s up significantly in assaults, b&e and motor theft relative to the previous 4 years. Absolutely the LNP and right wing media’s hennypennying is bad, but Labor and the Guardian’s “there’s nothing to see here everything is fine” response is equally as bad as it makes people align with the LNP because what Labor is saying is not people’s reality on the ground. The LNP and rw media then play to that mistake. The AFR did a survey a few weeks back and 46% of people had been a victim of crime in the past year or directly knew someone that had been. People’s experience was just doesn’t align with what the government were telling them, and that’s always a recipe for a bad time for a government
99. Crime can be lower but still too high You can try and target poor kids at risk before they turn to crime while at the same time punish those who commit serious offences
100. Again, just because you don’t react to something some way, doesn’t mean others will be fine with it too. You have so much empathy for the petty criminals, try having some for the victims too, who are often not going to be as resilient as you. Fear is the problem here and you saying “you shouldn’t be scared because I’m not” comes across as dismissive for people who have different experiences than you, in the same way you’re upset people aren’t considering your experiences. Also, youth crime is not significantly down in assaults, breaking and entering and motor theft and you have to stop saying it is because it doesn’t help your case. The stats don’t support you unless you lump “all crime” in there — all crime is not the problem, the problem is specifically the things I listed and they are what people see. And there is a need to treat *some* of these kids more forcefully than others, not so much putting them into adult prisons but being able to keep them out of society for a while because with no ability for sentencing for high risk offenders many will take it that the law is not a risk for them and they will just do it again… until they are *are* adults at which time they have a mindset they can get away with anything and then they get proper sentences - which is not good for them. This is the whole thing, not being able to treat any of them differently to the others despite different offenders carrying different types of risk is silly. For some of them, their actions are extreme enough that they need to be separated from society, regardless of how sad their upbringing is. The challenge is how do you do it in away that rehabilitates rather than just punishes. And that is a long term problem. And most of the voters evidently think you can’t just say “ah well it might be better in 20 years” they want to feel safe now. And people wanting to feel safe in their own home is a powerful motivator and not a stupid one at all.
101. I’ve just moved back to Townsville from Brisbane. Our “nice home in a nice suburb” in Brisbane had multiple break ins - seperate occasions my partner had his car vandalised - had his plates stolen - all these things cost us money and time. We have ring doorbells and cameras and provide everything for the police yet all we got back every single time was we don’t know exactly who did this so the case is archived. I barely sleep anymore. The dog sneezes and I’m on high alert, the wind will even wake me up now and good luck going back to sleep. My justice or peace is not some child with no consequences and a fed belly. My grandmother who I’ve moved back in with to look after works for the Townsville juvie and even she says the kids aren’t getting better. They’re more brazen and some even spit at her and all she does is their laundry. Very grateful we live out in the sticks even by Townsville standards How long can you expect people to watch themselves, their friends and their families be victims of crimes where there is either no culprit found or the culprit is found and gets at most a stern talking to and then do it again A 5 year old child in cairns got a fractured skull by a boy who was already facing 9 other chargers prior to throwing the rock How long do you expect people to “trust the process” before actually getting angry and wanting real things done about it? I didn’t even vote LNP first but I think these takes on crime really do delegitimise people’s genuine concerns for their safety
102. Where can i find the QLD police statistics?
103. Wow. One wonders if next they'll try to sue organisations tackling teenage alcohol use, for the same reason (pregnancy). Or if they'll sue each states' education department for educating girls **at all**, given the inverse link between a society's female education rates and teen pregnancy.
104. Good on you! That must have taken a lot of work, and I'm glad you had that mentorship available. A lot of people are acting like jailing kids will teach them respect and self-worth, when it's actually the complete opposite. Yet without respect for others and respect/self-worth for themselves, nothing is gonna change for these kids and they'll just dig the hole deeper.
105. > What helped me was having decent support at school, proactive interactions from teachers and members of the community, and as an adult, a lot of therapy. Which is precisely where the primary focus should be - proactive interventions to stop criminals becoming criminals in the first place. QPS should not be the first line of defence!
106. \`\`well done! its great to see stories like this.
