Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Politically illiterate? For what not voting left ðŸ˜‚
2. Nice take, simply for being conservative. I hope they hack laborâ€™s policies to pieces.
3. Makes it all the more depressing when we are a very rich country. The paper is there, just the distribution model that is fucked.
4. That is an absolutely bullshit comparison. Not only comparing domestic wealth to state wealth. Labor has the funds to run all these social programs and complete a restructure of the fire service AND Justice Department along with delivering extra policing resources and firefighting resources, etc. Etc. The state is in a surplus for the third year in a row.
5. Holy shit, this doesn't even make sense. I'm stunned you even know how to keep a device powered. Let alone use it to communicate the drivel that is swimming around in your brain.
6. Speculation
7. That's great and all but what happens when they're released from prison? Do you really believe that locking them up means they won't re-offend when they're out? Does locking these people up mean others won't also do the same thing? In your opinion, what works? What does 'working' look like? And what makes you think it will work?
8. Your inability to admit fault, or even just acknowledge your ignorange, is not at all endearing. You acting stupid wasn't cool in high school, and it's not cool now, a year later.
9. How when Albo is refusing to increase the federal share above what has been in place?
10. You could be right but it's all a prediction. If labour won, who says they'd go through with their promise? The mining revenue is protect3d by legislation that was passed in late Sept. The LNP has said they won't change the legislation.
11. Yep it's multi generational
12. Agreed. It's not necessarily "kids are hungry right now so they steal", but about brain development and helping kids learn. If a kid is hungry through their formative years, they are going to fall behind at school, and that leads to bigger problems when they are teenagers.
13. Not an idea. It's fact. Childhood malnutrition has lifetime negative effects on the brain.
14. I'm from a rural area, and at the risk of sounding like a boomer at the ripe old age of 28, there's a world of difference between bored, disenchanted kids making a nuisance of themselves and smashing windows at the old butter factory and kids committing B&Es and pinching cars. For what it's worth we've had several local community groups approach both the council and state government with proposals for activities and free spaces for young people and they've been met with resounding silence.
15. So victim blaming and free lunches is the answer? Right.
16. It should be, but it wasn't...the majority of LNP voters I queried said "why should I pay for school lunches and when my kids didn't get free lunches". They have no clue about anything beyond what affects them personally.. Obvious and LNP voters arent one in the same thing. It 100% needed better explaining..
17. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
18. Cool, I was just addressing the comment I answered to. Not sure where you got that I was dissatisfied with the ticket.
19. As an early LNP voter absolutely not. But I knew for months who I was voting for and many who vote early are the same.
20. I disagree completely, and thatâ€™s a massive strawman ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
21. Some serious ground work needs to take place on what it means to be Australian. Unfortunately part of the national identity has been hijacked by the conservative (non Australian owned) media
22. They're a bunch of cookers and yuppies
23. And people voting LNP just because labour is being in for so long or because they've always voted this way. Zero brain cells put to work in the decision
24. When you are a junior reporter fighting over the scraps with AI, you have no choice but to defend a broken system. Journalism will come to be dominated by a well connected elite as the money to pay people gets less and less
25. No problem. Didn't even take that into consideration, you're just a Queenslander to me
26. Oh yeah I got destroyed. I was fooled into potentially doing his argument for him. The fool I am!
27. That's fine admitting you were talking shit is honourable
28. Greens were a little weirder this time
29. No, for treating political parties as sporting teams and always voting the same way you always have because thatâ€™s what youâ€™ve always doneâ€¦ Speaking of political illiteracyâ€¦
30. It's amazing how many people think state budgets should be managed like a household.
31. And I would like to keep more of my money to provide for my family thanks. Don't need gov to provide lunches that you know will cost at least double what I can provide lunches to my kids for. So politely, get the fuck out of my pocket and stop spending my money like a drunken sailor in a whore house
32. Doesn't surprise me it doesn't make sense to you. It's Reddit where lower IQ individuals are over represented. Can't connect dots that high debt can maintain an appearance of wealth.
33. It's more realistic than speculating on or being fearful of shit that won't happen.
34. They re-offend now with the no punishment approach, let's give it a try, impose suitable sentences and let's see where we are in 10 years because what we are doing now doesn't work.
35. We shall all wake up tomorrow, morons and other. Equally happy with our political positions. But, you want to know a secret bosde, youâ€™ve fucked yourself and we can all laugh at that. Because voting against getting a cut of our coal sales doesnâ€™t make sense, shooting temp nurses, teachers and labourers doesnâ€™t make sense. And as a direct result YOUR life will get worse directly, and that, for me, for the next 4 years; thatâ€™s satisfying. Eventually youâ€™ll learn.
36. Crime is going down my dude, you can screech all you want about it.
37. It's called negotiations. But anyway. I'm a form guide type of guy. I don't watch the race.
38. That is such a reductive and pointless argument. How do you know LNP will do anything that they promised? Labour's track record, especially recently, has been implementing changes (see above for recent ones). They have funded and budgeted for all of these ambitious policies. The extra money came from the coal companies via increased taxes which is why they want LNP in. The simple fact is, now that labour are out, we are guaranteed none of this is going to happen. LNP will do noting at best except open up some youth prisons, or remove environmental protections, sell off some state owned assets, and sack a massive chunk of public servants at worst. They aren't going to address cost of living.
39. What kind of "nuisance of themselves" shit did you do?
40. I'll take things that didn't happen for 5,000 Anna
41. Did I say that? But it is just a car v human.
42. That's fair enough. But the stark vote difference between early and election day suggests a change in the electorate.
43. It has mate, and back to my last comment, these are the same people claiming to protect the Australian identity, do they themselves even know what it means?
44. Thanks mate, we're in this together
45. No bro you're just way too salty about a state election I'd hate to see you if Dutton won get some perspective Jesus. I don't know why you want specifics on which jobs were valid to cut and which jobs weren't 9 YEARS AGO. 14,000 a normal person would assume (which you're clearly not) some of them would be valid some of them wouldn't, Queensland and public service remained and he didn't sell any state assets regardless of what people here will tell you. Now dry your eyes and finish the chicken nuggies your mum made you it's getting late I'm sure you have to be up early tomorrow to disappoint your family and annoy your coworkers. Grow up.
46. Again you are saying people canâ€™t make their own mind up. You simply assume that why they voted a certain way which is the exact reason the election was lost.
47. It comes from the resources royalties. You're not paying any extra. Nice to see you want children to starve though.
48. Itâ€™s not coming out of your pocketâ€¦ itâ€™s paid for by the mining resource tax. LNP is going to scrap that AND take more money out of your pocket. Selfish and ignorant voters like you are the problem. No idea how any thing works and so easy to manipulate by making you turn on anyone who you think might be getting a helping hand from your dollarâ€¦ your dollar probably doesnâ€™t even cover the services you consume.
49. You simply can't say that it won't happen, though. Look at my last reply. Classic LNP voter right here. Looks like it's not part of your plan and you've ruled it out. Until it is.
50. Yeah, none of those things will impact my family or I, so you have missed the mark there. Because of the current state of the state responsibilities in our regions: a) I don't benefit from 50c fares b) I don't go to public emergency departments c) I have my daughter in private school d) I have seen the state government dragging their feet on local infrastructure for the past decade Labor might have gotten my vote, or at least a higher preference, if they'd acted over the past 10 years to address the issues affecting the regions instead of ignoring them.
51. Oh for fucks sake, can we say it for everyone up the back. THE COAL ROYALTIES ARE PROTECTED BY LEGISLATION PASSED IN LATE SEPTEMBER. THE LNP HAVE SAID THEY WONT CHANGE IT! yes Labour did a lot of good stuff, suspiciously close to election time. How do you know they were going to do everything they promised. Labor has gone back.on election primises plenty of times. Will the LNP be better than Labor? Who the fuck knows but the people who voted them in are prepared to risk that.
52. I think I've given up calling them human. What about the teenagers that beat the 68 year old woman after breaking into her house? 12 year old stealing cars, stabbing people in broad daylight. Yeah, I don't class them as human. I don't care if they're thrown in a pit for the rest of their lives. Sick to death of the fucking victim blaming.
53. Yes, you did. You obviously don't grasp the fact that for a lot of people what you think is "just a car" is their livelihood, especially in regional areas where you can't just hop on a train or a bus to get to work. Plus, forking out for comprehensive insurance for your car and house would be a struggle for a lot of people who are barely scraping by as it is.
54. No it doesnâ€™t. It can be explained by a million different reasons. Maybe those that are more likely to vote LNP, own businesses (like me) or are in senior roles which gives them the time and flexibility to vote earlier. Maybe those that vote greens or labor are more tradies and 9-5â€™ers that find it easier on weekends. Maybe labor voters like sausages more, so go on election day. I doubt very many, if ANY LNP voters regret their vote, and would have swung to the left on election day ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
55. You made the claim. Don't talk shit if you can't back it up. It's really that simple. Don't give me this bullshit about probably maybe some were bloated. Either stand by your convictions and actually prove it or retract the statement and admit you were just talking shit. It's telling you say grow up after a childish attempt to infantalise me because you aren't able to back up your argument. Says it all really.
56. Omg mate, re-read the thread weâ€™re responding toâ€¦ Speaking about someone who agreed with the policies of one party, but refused to vote for them as heâ€™s voted for another party his whole life. Iâ€™m not speaking about Libs vs Labor here, work on your reading comprehension skills pleaseâ€¦
57. The implication I can't provide for my kids is funny. Like that's the choice here right? I either submit to government doing a parenting job and feeding us or we starve.. Like sheep, perhaps you should live In a zoo. Then you can be excited at the prospect of someone wiping your ass.
58. I'm sorry? Not my pocket? Not the wages of people that work either indirectly or directly? Some magical pocket that is only the mining companies? I will wager London to a brick I have a far firmer grasp on how economics and the world works. My tax bill is likely multiples of what Centrelink pay you. Sick of being a milk cow for leeches who not only don't contribute, but somehow think they know how best to spend a dollar when they have never earned an honest one in their life
59. And you also can't say youth crime is BS. It's down statewide but in north Qld and particularly Townsville it's not. There is nuance. But again, like many on the left you seem to just dismiss any point made that you don't want to hear and that anyone who disagrees with you must have been swayed by media. It's never 'maybe I'm wrong' it's always something external that causes it
60. Same for any plan by anyone ever. And in 4 years when nothing changes on abortion will you admit you were scared or fearful for no reason? Probably not. You'll jump on the next Labor thing to be paranoid about.
61. Yeah I don't buy that. They'll try to change it sneakily, they got too much money from the big coal guys not to. Look I fucking hate politicians as much as anyone, but you have to admit Labour actually having a plan and a budget to back it up makes it likely to happen. And it's the same "yeah but how do you KNOW" argument, which is completely baseless because nobody knows. I sincerely hope that Chrisafulli swoops in on his blue and gold magic carpet and fixes all the problems with housing, healthcare and cost of living, but I just don't see it happening. If he does all that I'll vote Libs next election. Unless they try to block renewables again that is...
62. Itâ€™s still a car. You are talking about locking up kids. I live in a regional area. Kids. Locked up. Really healthy. Anyway, you got your wish. Lock em up! Lock em upâ€¦. Why has nothing changed?
63. I'm talking about swing voters who voted LNP, not rusted on LNP voters. You may be right. The use of the emojis is very childish though.
64. Sounds like you're saying that more information can't impact LNP voters. Which is probably right. Your examples above are very obviously biased, deliberately obtuse, and demonstrates perfectly a self-centred, spoiled value set. You are embarrassing. Congrats on the win. Hope you get everything you're after
65. Nah Iâ€™m good, jog on
66. Didn't say you can't provide for your kids. So you made the wrong inference there. Congrats on being wrong again. Some children have shit parents who don't feed them. Personally, I'm happy for my taxes to go towards social betterment. Besides, it is statistically proven that providing meals to children drastically increases school attendance rates and goes a long way in reducing crime. As I said earlier, the funds for school lunches would not have come at an additional tax to you. But you don't have to worry about that now, since you obviously voted in a party that lacks transparency and has a proven track record of putting people out of work in the name of "saving the economy."
67. These particular initiatives are paid for by the mining resource taxes. The small amount of tax that you pay at a state level would be going to services that you use and benefit from. Or do you think that you get no benefits from the government. Just some rugged individual that doesnâ€™t need the rest of society? For some context, Iâ€™ve been on centrelink, 20 years ago when I was younger for a very short time. Now I make a decent living a begrudge no one that might need that service. Whether thatâ€™s for a day or most of their lives. The majority of people do not want to be on centrelinkâ€¦ and the few that doâ€¦ I donâ€™t want them to become more of a burden on society when we see how desperate they get with out centrelink. A society with a safety net functions better than one with out. Again unless you an incredibly high earner your taxes are not even funding one persons worth of centrelink. Particularly when you take away the service you actually benefit from.
68. If you think youre getting a tax break from them being in power youre fucking dead wrong
69. You say that while buying into the campaign about youth crime. I just don't place as much value in cracking down on youth crime in Townsville as I do on ensuring cost of living benefits and bodily autonomy for women statewide. Hope you don't have any women in your life.
70. Kids that've committed serious crimes. People have been seriously assaulted, even murdered FFS. Emma Lovell's murder is particularly close to home since it happened close to where my fiancÃ© lives. 17 year old, already on probation, 84 prior convictions including 16 prior break-ins went on a 3 day bender then broke into a house on Boxing Day, stabbed Emma's husband twice and killed her. I sincerely doubt giving that "kid" a sandwich would've stopped him.
71. I didnâ€™t preference them first. 3rd actually. But, continue spooking and not looking at labor for the loss.
72. Classic "you're wrong" then refuses elaborate and leaves
73. It's either school lunches or prison lunches. LNP voters chose the latter.
74. Or just maybe, the majority of the state that voted for change doesn't want the government to be a paternal figure. Your argument can apply to anything, shit let's bring in ubi to everyone. You know why governments tax cigarettes so much? To disincentive smoking. I'm all for a social safety net but we need to stop subsidising poor choices. As for school lunches, it was literally a thought giggles had at 2am on the shitter when he realised buying votes the only chance he had. And now if you don't support it you want poor kids to starve. Can rightly piss off with that moral righteousness. But that's how they operate, promise free shit and if you oppose it you hate group X or Y. Ironically, two chromosomes that Labor seemed to have a problem identifying.
75. Except one is backed by facts and is a real issue for people in those electorates. You say cost of living benefits, you could have just said you value handouts. I have women in my life and have used abortion, I'm thankful that it exists as it should be a woman's right to choose autonomy etc. We won the battle, I just don't want to stay in the trenches fighting the abortion bogeyman.
76. Repeat offender. How will LNP fix that?
77. Ah the infallible "I have a black friend" defence. I should have known you'd use the forbidden technique.
78. Iâ€™m still here, not going anywhere
79. Would rather social programs that benefit people than additional punishments. UBI is a fantastic idea. I have no idea why you're using it as a negative. It would negate the need for all the various types of welfare. While we're at it, since you don't like paying taxes for social programs, go ahead and cancel your Medicare and family tax benefits. The cycle of effective governance is pretty simple. We pay taxes to the government, the government puts those taxes towards programs, infrastructure, etc., and the public makes use of those programs/infrastructure, etc. >As for school lunches, it was literally a thought giggles had at 2am on the shitter when he realised buying votes the only chance he had. Making assumptions yet again. The policy was based on research and data from places that had implemented these policies. >Ironically, two chromosomes that Labor seemed to have a problem identifying And bringing the subtle transphobia out. There it is. Don't think anymore needs to be said.
80. I prefer the handouts going to me than to mining corporate.
81. ðŸ˜‚ Okay. Good chat. Continue having a cry at your parties loss, which most of QLD wanted.
82. Prove it
83. Hang on I thought you were all about women's rights a second ago? What about their safe spaces? Can't have it both ways. I'd be quite happy to cancel all my Medicare if I'm not slugged the Medicare levy, but that's a Federal issue, not state. I don't doubt you'd like ubi, that is the entire problem. More than happy to live off the production of others. Those of us that actually contribute and create wealth would prefer to stop being not only milked, but abused while doing so just for the occasional election cycle.
84. Name one handout going to mining companies. I'll wait. If you mention fuel subsidy I'll fucking piss myself laughing. At you, not with you.
85. We already knew you're a transphobe, no need to reinforce it. Suggest you move to America then. You'll have your freedom from government there. Don't assume you know my lifestyle just because I support government incentives to help others. Further, your statement just goes to show you have no idea what the word "universal" means. It would benefit the rich just as much as the poor. The whole problem of Western society relies on this whole "fuck you I've got mine" attitude. Pretty piss-poor way to live life. I pity you.
86. Very likely that they're going to decrease royalties.
87. Are you familiar with the laffer curve?
88. What evidence suggests that the LNP-desired royalties would maximise revenue?
89. Read my prior comment as slowly and as many times as you'd like.
90. Spit it out, mate
91. Fuck, let's increase royalties to 100%. Imagine how much revenue we will bring in! While at it we can get federal gov to increase minimum wage to $150/hr. We will all be rich. If you even slightly understand that the above 2 points are ridiculous then you understand that higher tax rates at a certain point are counter productive. Again, go find out what the laffer curve is. I've spent enough time arguing with double digit IQ individuals for a Sunday.
92. Yes I know what it is. That's why i asked you what evidence suggests that LNP-desired royalty rates would maximise revenue. There's a specific taxation rate that maximises revenue, so please do tell me how the LNP would find and implement it? You're all mouth and no facts. Take a bit of your own advise and do some research.
93. What evidence suggests Labor have the policy settings correct? That they aren't leaving revenue on the table by setting it too high. 10% of a large number is more than 90% of a small number.
94. You're the one that brought up the Laffer curve, so you must have evidence about the optimal royalty rate, right?
95. If you were aware of the laffer curve you would realise the exact optimum rate cannot be empirically calculated. Nothing happens in a vacuum. Maybe, just maybe the optimum rate for revenue to the government is lower than the current rate given how many projects have been stalled. We will know in hindsight. But hey, that's not very pragmatic to entertain the thought it might actually be a positive
96. So bringing it up has no value. Clutch at more straws, why don't you?
97. Clutch at more pearls... The lnp are coming for our abortions, our royalty rates, our kids!! If you're older than 30 you have no brains.
