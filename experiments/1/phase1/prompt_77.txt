Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. reducing youth crime will be on their main agenda townsville and cairns has been shocking post covid when it comes to youth crime. when labor say youth crime is down there talking about inner Brisbane but not all of qld they have had plenty of time to fix it but nothing has been done to fix it one way to slow it down would be to lift that covid mandate for police and rehire police that have been sacked cause of the mandate then maybe we might see a slow decrease in youth crime
2. It depends on if you trust their policies and that they will do them or not. Because a few of their policies do have some potential, and I was surprised. For example they recently announced that they would cut funding for external consultants, and instead rebuild the civil service with jobs that pay comparably and that will allow them to build up the civil service long term expertise. On the surface that actually appeals to me. I just have to forget that they are the ones who gutted the civil service in the first place, and frankly I don't trust them that they will actually do this in a real way. Their policy publications online are often like this. Sound ok on the surface, but when you dig into the details they are problematic, or I simply do not believe them at all because the policy goes against their traditional policy ideas.
3. No
4. A portion of voters aren't politically informed, or informed by free to air tv / sky news and they have a **very** heavy bias towards the LNP, even if its just showing them more on tv it might be enough for someone to think 'hey that guy looks familiar I'll vote for him'.
5. That depends on your beliefs about how effective his methods will be. Much as many people would like to paint it otherwise, Crisafulli and the LNP are not the big bad who is out to get you, they are people who are trying to put forward their vision for the community. Like all political parties, that usually involves helping out your mates. The LNPs mates are different to Labor's mates, and you may even be mates with their mates - but make no mistake, *everyone* has mates. Personally, I think that the effective things he's suggesting are the following, partially stolen from another redditor: \- Increased funding to early intervention residential programs and $80 million on new court-sentenced facilities for young offenders in remote areas. \- Plans to re-establish the productivity commission to conduct a regulatory review into the building industry as part of their strategy to address cost-of-living issues. \- Increased hiring of healthcare workers \- Plans for the increased construction of social housing But... there are plenty more things that the ALP are doing I agree with, and plenty more things that the LNP are doing that I disagree with. The take-home message here is that *of course* Crisafulli will have some ideas to benefit the community, and some of these may even be good ideas. Anyone who says otherwise is betraying their partisan stance. But that doesn't mean he's the right choice. I will be voting ALP today, and I hope you do too.
6. As someone who isnt racist and doesnt hate the elderly,women,non religious and modern technology I can honestly say LNP does nothing.
7. Does "Be such a bad premier that the memory of him will help Labor stay in for another couple of decades after we kick him out" count? (Well that's only a good thing if other political forces eg. Teals, Greens can get enough influence to hold the Government to account, but that's a whole other debate. LNP=bad whichever way you slice it)
8. They have already stitched up the jobs4daboyz. A mate of mine is hopeful of a Ministerial job. I think the party just hints at these things to get bodies on the ground
9. Just their mates in mining and gambling.
10. Im not even following the news or polls, but I suspect it’s regional qld where miles will lose it. Feels like there is plenty of support for him in SEQ. So yeah, not much point raising it in r/Brisbane.
11. I only heard his name for the first time about a week ago, and it's just been a torrent of "this guy is bad" for... reasons? I lose interest _very_ quickly the second I hear anything sounding politics-y. Now, I _have_ actually heard of Miles, but all I know about him is he's part of why we have 50c Translink fares. I have no idea whether Crisafulli is actually bad, or the other guys are just screaming it so they win. I don't know if Miles is actually a good bloke, or if the Translink stuff is just hiding something iffy. I don't know how people could possibly have the time or energy to do all the research to make a properly informed decision, especially with everything being drowned out with "this guy is bad!" garbage everywhere.
12. I see no good coming out of a Crisafulli government, he’s a reactionary misogynist and I dread the likelihood of his ascension to power. There is nothing in his policies that would make the life of the average Queenslander better, nothing at all
13. I'm praying for a hung parliament.
14. Honestly, (some) Australians are the most selfish people I've ever met after Americans, but at least americans will debate a little. Australia has some of the lowest media literacy rates in the world. Our comprehension is so so SO low. People who aren't invested in knowing, who don't have to know; don't really have a good grasp on what's happening, because they're not paying attention, unless something affects them. I studied journalism at uni (didn't complete, had a menty b), and was shown a bunch of stats on world media literacy rates as well as other interesting/depressing stats in 1st year. Australia's rates of understanding world politics, world history, important events, W H Y they started happening - is quite low compared to the rest of the world. Also, I think a lot of white australians are really sensitive and stop listening if they're told they're wrong. They don't have the empathy and curiosity to want to know how/why. Not all white ppl, you know who you are, if this isn't you, it isn't you, etc etc. But yeah, huge mental blocks for a specific group of people, people who don't have to reckon with the consequences of their decisions. Also, business has a vested interest in mass ignorance around everything except what you need to know to do your job and surface level entertainment so you can 'keep going(working)'. Yeah, capitalism. Scary word for some people. Sure, it would be nice if people actually learned about it. Black n brown people are talking about all of you in our own circles. But it would be nice if some of you caught up, and took the time to educate yourselves. We didn't get to our place of knowing by not looking for information. Build up your resilience, ffs. we can't teach you if you'r not listening. Who has been keeping all of us behind? Will you become them? Or will you put some effort in and make a change. Sorry for ranting. It's the same conversation I've seen people have for 2 decades at this point, I'm 27. I've heard elders n older people say that some people seem to have the same conversations every election. 'Why are we so behind? Why don't people learn? Why do people continue to ignore whats right in front of them? When will the other shoe drop? When will they realise they're pawns if they're not educating themselves? And these people never move forward from that point. They say the same thing every time, as if there's a mental block that they don't want to confront. Ever. We watch as they kick the can down the road and pass on the trauma because it feels better than dealing with it. We see it in so many people. And like, we get it, ignorance is bliss, and yet, its annoying, and this ignorance is killing the youth. Politics is a game to them, unless they're the one going to jail. Multiple things can be true at the same time. Rant over, if you made it to the bottom, thank you. You'll do better than everyone who stopped. Literally, your empathy, curiosity, and bandwidth is higher than the people who gave up. So a lil treat for you. Good job. I'm proud that you read some heavy shit. It's not an easy thing to do, and it's a great practise to get into. Now do it again tomorrow. Because you can, and you'll be better off for it. Grew up in Gimuy. Life is tough, and its fun to rant every now and then. Comment n tell me where I lost you so i can word it better next time 🤷🏽🫶🏽🪼
15. You only have to look at his business dealings. Shady AF
16. To those with medicinal cannabis prescriptions "smoke 'em if you got 'em"
17. The reason you aren't getting any information about anything "good" the LNP is going to do..... is because they basically have no policies other than running Trump style scare campaigns. They are 100% owned and controlled by the Coal mining industry (look at the donations flow) and far right religious groups. They are just in to setup themselves for cushy pensions and corp consulting positions in 4 years time. It is NOT because "r3dit I5 aN 3cH0 c@amB3r" Every time this question has been asked, any LNP support can't give an answer other than "r3dit I5 aN 3cH0 c@amB3r" wah wah wah. Each one of their scare policies (youth crime etc) has been shot down with objective facts. Their polices literally boil down to FUCK WOMEN FUCK THE KIDS FUCK THE POOR HAND OUTS TO OUR MATES
18. The LNP exists as a political avenue for corporate Australia to get their hands on government money and contracts. They support whatever their donors support. So if you are not a big business owner, coal or mining baron, property developer or something like that, the LNP is not for you and will never look out for your interests.
19. LNP are for the top of town. The richy rich
20. Sort by controversial for the real good answers.
21. This sub/reddit is an alp echo chamber, so you'll get all the answers you're looking for.
22. Tomorrow will be day 219 of his announced [100 day review](https://www.foxsports.com.au/olympics/queensland-opposition-leader-vows-to-fix-the-mess-after-olympics-crisis/news-story/995866b87814598ce9b97790c5694e43) plan for the Olympics. I’m not much of a calendrist, but I feel like the 100 days could have fit into the 219 day period easily.
23. That’s the result of the LNP running a small target strategy. No one knows what they stand for. No policy details. No costing details. No answer on protecting Women’s reproductive healthcare rights like Abortion. Personally, I think Crisafulli will be Campbell Newman 2.0.
24. Are you actually sorry? Fuck I can't wait for this election to be done with
25. A frighteningly large percentage (edit: after rechecking 44%) of Australian adults test at BKSB 2 or lower for literacy and numeracy. A BKSB result of 3 is considered functionally literate. This extends to media literacy and the ability to access and interpret policy. Edit: adding some links for more info. This is not about calling anyone 'dumb', there are real barriers to developing these skill sets and it makes me so angry that a few people make a whole career out of being as misleading as possible while staying technically within the legal lines. https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/literacy-and-access https://www.acer.org/au/discover/article/the-importance-of-measuring-adult-literacy-and-numeracy
26. Looking forward to Monday so I don't need to see all of the Labor and LNP bot posts here. Not to mention the SMS and robo calling from the big two parties.
27. Stephen Miles has only been premier for a year and a half. In that time he’s done amazing work, and there’s nothing to suggest that it wouldn’t continue. Should he get re-elected. In fact, it looks like things would actually get a lot better if he delivers even half of what he said. If we continue to tax the coal mines this tiny 6% we might actually have enough to pay for the Olympics without it turning into a another “ $300 billion for three submarines” type deal the LNP love to make.
28. I can't wait for this fucking election to be over so my reddit can back to normal. You won't hear any positive things about the LNP here, nor will you hear any negatives of the ALP beyond surface level criticism. The answer to every election cant be 'everyone else but me is stupid' or the 'media is rigged' because that lack of self reflection of why a party wasn't able to convince people to vote for them is how you loose election after election after election. Realistically, the media is rigged is such an old joke considering Labor has been as close to complete power since the Joh Bjelke Peterson era, except for a couple years of LNP here or there.. They've genuine had some of the longest runs of electoral success in Australian history and it really puts a thorn to the side of the media is rigged argument.
29. The mining industry is part of the community isn't it?
30. It’s like a kinda surprise, not until you vote do you find out
31. Nothing, just big business and the churches.
32. There is no “can be an echo chamber,” It definitely is one. You should have asked “I think Crisafulli is the devil, why should I vote Labour or Greens?”
33. Yes. Crusafulli will help usher in another 18 years of the LNP being a shadow government next election.
34. Oh look it’s this thread again
35. Game of Matessss
36. Something that sadly a lot of voters no longer consider.
37. Short answer, no. Long answer. Nooooooooooooooooooo........
38. I'm so dissapointed in the lack of anything he's brought to the table. If he wins its not because he really tried. More like there was no other options.
39. Neoliberal philosophy is all about small government. It's hard to help the community without spending anything while selling off assets to make it look like you're the "strong economy" party .
40. C c c
41. I will say this, if any politician wants to help the community, they would WORK with the opposition in doing so. Like at the end of the day they are elected to represent the community and the people. Put an end to this party lines bull shit and work together to better the communities which you serve.
42. Another thing that’s increasingly worrying to me is the amount of people who DON’T vote, or who just don’t care to vote correctly in accordance to what they want. I’m a support worker for elderly who are still mostly independent and a lot of them don’t care to vote or they want to vote out Labor, but have no real reason to support this. To be fair, I didn’t really understand how my vote counted in the past but I was always there voting, sometimes wasn’t sure but always put independents first. After that, I couldn’t tell you how I voted the rest of the parties in order. Since last year I’ve been keeping up to date with politics - while confusing to me still sometimes - I actually know who to vote for now, and how to order the rest of the candidates. I’m honestly feeling incredibly stressed about the results of this election if the lnp gets in because of misguided voters and terrible campaigning. I also read a rumour (and I’m calling it this because I have not researched about the lnp members to know or confirm this) that a lot of the members are very religious? And I just think if that’s what is swaying them to decide they are pro-life and not pro-choice, that sickens me. Religion should not have a place in politics nor be a determining factor on a women’s right to choose. Again, probably just a rumour and I let myself get too carried away thinking about this. If you’re reading this and you’re voting today - all I can say is show up and make your vote count.
43. Can someone tell me about KAP? I know who Katter is, but when I voted, there were only Greens, Libertarians, ALP, LNP, One Nation? Where does KAP come in? Or is it because there isn’t a KAP candidate for my electorate?
44. Be nice if Crisafulli could just an answer a question that is asked of him. Was asked only 3 questions on the today show this morning and just sidestepped each question.
45. Community or mates? It would be some of both, as always and then the voters will see it like the old blind men and the elephant, some feeling that it’s one thing and others feeling that it was something else based on their own varying values and priorities.
46. Helps small businesses
47. What? You mean you cant see how much better off you will be when he cancels the Truth Telling & Healing? We don't need to the truth of the ongoing impacts of the methods of colonisation and treatment of its original inhabitants. We've been good so far ignoring all that.
48. Well, yes. You'll be able to come together as a community to offer thoughts and prayers to the women of Queensland who can't get an abortion.
49. Crisafulli's electorate vote count is impressive. He is doing something right for his neighbours it seems. Reddit users in this sub are incredibly ALP bias so I'm not sure how much factual info you will get.
50. The good thing is we will see less of him now he is Premier. He got whinge about everything.
51. Do you think that the LNP will make a difference in QLD. I don't think so. You will get the same bad roads, the same crime rate. The LNP will not help the people that are finding it difficult to see a doctor. The LNP wont help with power prices or price gouging fuel prices. You all need to realise that it's a big game. You the public don't gain. Just Sayin😀
52. If nothing else, shifting all the director generals on from the public service and asking some hard questions of the people doing the work will have an impact. It's not a good thing for any company or government when leadership is stagnant and the things being swept under the rug are never challenged.
53. The LNP aren't community minded - Why haven't we learned that by now? 🤦🏼‍♀️
54. If you know Reddit is an e ho chamber, it seems an odd place to ask your question. Unsurprisingly I haven't scrolled through and seen a single lnp voter yet. So take the reason s you are getting for why people vote for them with a healthy grain salt
55. 99% of what this sub says about Crisafulli and the LNP in general is largely nonsense. There are way too many Labor followers/members here who are desperate to paint him as the next Campbell Newman. It's not only incorrect but it's a pretty dangerous way to go about things. Here's a general summary of their policy platform: Youth Crime: The LNP has focused heavily on addressing what they describe as Queensland's "youth crime crisis." They propose introducing "adult time" for young offenders who commit serious crimes such as murder and manslaughter. The plan includes spending $50 million on early intervention residential programs and $80 million on new court-sentenced facilities for young offenders in remote areas. Detention Policies: The LNP plans to introduce a minimum time in isolation for detainees who assault detention center staff. They also promise to scrap the clause in the Youth Justice Act that provides for "detention as a last resort". Public Transport and Utilities: Both the LNP and Labor have committed to maintaining reduced public transport fares. The LNP also plans to re-establish the productivity commission to conduct a regulatory review into the building industry as part of their strategy to address cost-of-living issues. Abolition of Payroll Tax: The LNP has promised to immediately and permanently abolish the payroll tax if elected. This move is aimed at alleviating financial pressure on medical practices and preventing increased costs for patients. The party argues that the tax is a short-term measure that could lead to long-term issues within the healthcare system. Youth Crime Initiatives: The LNP has focused on addressing youth crime by proposing "adult time" for young offenders who commit serious crimes. They plan to invest $50 million in early intervention residential programs and $80 million in new court-sentenced facilities for young offenders in remote areas. Additionally, they propose scrapping the "detention as a last resort" clause from the Youth Justice Act. Healthcare Improvements: The LNP aims to reduce ambulance ramping to below 30% by 2028 and promises to provide real-time health and hospital data within 100 days of taking office. They have also committed to hiring 34,200 extra health workers by 20322. Housing Development: The LNP plans to build 1 million new homes by 2044, including 53,500 for social housing. They have also proposed a $165 million shared-equity scheme to assist aspiring homeowners with deposits2. Stance on Abortion: Crisafulli has stated his support for a woman's right to choose and has assured that there will be no changes to the current abortion laws. He has emphasized allowing conscience votes on such issues within his party, reflecting a moderate stance on this contentious topic Path to Treaty: The LNP has vowed to stop Queensland's Path to Treaty and the Truth Telling and Healing Inquiry, arguing that funding should focus more on service delivery for Indigenous communities. Emissions Targets: The LNP supports emissions reduction targets set by the state parliament, which include a 30% reduction from 2005 levels by 2030 and achieving net zero by 20503.
56. The answer is no, the community will suffer and the effects would be almost immediate. There is a reason the coal companies are investing in his campaign (the same companies which he has investments in)
57. [deleted]
58. I'm not sure this is the place you'll get a good answer. My current local member is from the LNP and I've been pretty happy with his support of community causes. But he's also promised quite a substantial sum for new buildings at my child's school if the LNP win government. At the moment the school has to apply for grants or raise money via the P&C (ie the parents) when ever they need anything like money to replace or upgrade playgrounds, put in computer or STEM labs or even library books for when they changed the approach to phonics. We don't have anyone to write for grants unless we hire them, which hasn't been done, so we miss out on so much funding that other schools seem to get. And to be honest I don't think it's fair to fund schools based on being able to write for grants rather than based on when they actually need to upgrade their facilities. There are other things, of course, I definitely don't cast a vote based on a single issue. It's not a referendum.
59. Simple answer is that Rupert Murdoch owns the bullhorn.
60. Hi all! I’m a conservative voter, so probably fit the outside the echo chamber. I’m not strongly motivated by Aussie politics atm and less so by state politics. One of the issues that does motivate me and I’m sure many others like me is of course abortion. Society (me and most conservatives included) has agreed that women have the right to an abortion during the early stages of pregnancy. The current qld law has it at 22 weeks. Again there is general agreement that abortion must be available after that time for (physical) medical reasons. Under the labor government currently, a termination can still be performed, after 22 weeks, if the medical practitioner has consulted a second medical practitioner and there is agreement a termination should occur. The reasons for a termination are: 1) all relevant medical circumstances; and 2) the woman’s current and future physical, psychological and social circumstances. It is the second set of reasons that raises a serious question. Are we really contemplating termination of pregnancy after the baby would be viable if delivered for reasons to do with “future psychological or social circumstances”? If we are not contemplating that outcome, why does the legislation clearly permit such an outcome. Indeed there legislation is silent on the status of the foetus where pregnancy is terminated after viability! These are tough decisions. My summary of the legislation is directly from the “Termination of pregnancy bill 2018”. Please do not try to challenge my reading of this legislation, unless you have also read it. It’s free online. It’s not a big document.
61. I guess this is a matter of perspective. But personally I judge politicians by how much they use evidence to inform their policies. On this criteria none of crisafulli's policies align with any evidence and have been called out as such. Miles' policies on the other hand are based on evidence for the most part.
62. He hasn't released any positive policies or grants that will benefit the state. The exact opposite in fact. Qld will get a lot more expensive if LNP get in. I cant believe we're about to throw all the progress we've made over the past 4 years away
63. He’s offering graft for his mates (eg rolling back laws regarding developer donations) as well as sinking the boot into out groups (eg more punitive drug laws) and women (eg abortion laws). Everything else is just lies (eg every word out of his mouth about health care).
64. So FYI - on Sportsbet, they had Libs at 8:1 favourites on labour last week. This has since been adjusted to -3.25:1 - so still a pretty strong prediction the Libs will get up. It must be the die hards who’ll continue to vote because the campaign, from an end user point of view, has be backing Smiley Miley all the way. I don’t like him but I like his policies.
