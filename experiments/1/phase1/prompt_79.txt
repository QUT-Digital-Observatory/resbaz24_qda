Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. All 'youth crime' policies have been widely panned universally by experts who work in the field, and the idea of a crisis is almost entirely made up. Their policies, at best, will be utterly ineffective, and it's much more likely to make things worse. The 'conscience vote' is the path they will use to try and wind back abortion laws, as KAP has already confirmed they will bring one forward. No matter what noise Crisafulli makes about there being 'no change' it's a lie; if he's allowing a conscience vote, the laws will change with a LNP government
2. Mining Royalties, the LNP has committed to a return to private interests being given Queensland owned resources for free depriving the state of an income stream.
3. He supported at the 11th hour didn't he.....The question was always about whether he would allow a conscience vote or not. We have a recent history in how that would go.
4. Not labor supporters. Human beings who have regular human morals. The kind of people who care and have empathy towards the elderly, non white people, the poor and the desperate.
5. Thank you for stating these. I personally still think he's shithouse and there are a few things like the 50c fares, emissions targets and stance on abortion which he's been disingenuous and untruthful on, but thank you for outlining what he's said.
6. Unfortunately you've just wasted your time and effort posting this. There are none so blind as those who will not see - people here will still declare the LNP have proposed "absolutely zero policies" despite your efforts.
7. Aw shucks, you're onto me. Glad you were here to drop your 2 cents in tho and help boost it to the top, thanks champ
8. at what point do you say he's doing a bad job then? since labor controls every state in the country as well as federal government right now. Labor have been in government in Queensland for like 30 years outside of the Newman government over a decade ago. Yet still this shadow of mr burns rupert murdoch pulling the strings looms large over reddit...
9. That's exactly what I'm starting to see is that the mass population seem to like shooting themselves in the foot then bitch about it
10. AGREE >It seems to me that people are having last minute hesitation about Crisafulli and the LNP. Many issues are lacking detail and require more detailed information. the Devil you know or the other Devil we used to know from Campbell Newman days. Then the Devil is in the details. All politicians are going to Hell, they know it so they make self serving decisions
11. I don't know why you are getting downvoted. The Brisbane and Qld subs are massive echo chambers. I thought we all realised this last year after the No vote. And the people who voted No are probably voting LNP. I can't understand how these subs can't get their heads around this. Your average LNP NO voters probably isn't on Reddit. Just like how you're not hanging out with them.
12. This sub is predominantly anti-regressive and anti-conservative. There was plenty of debate around Labor policies prior to the election. The sub has focused on Pro Labor because it wants the LNP defeated for obvious reasons. But it isn't by default, a Pro Labor Sub.
13. Made even worse by the fact that even reasonable posts such as yours are downvoted. So many posts ask why anyone would vote LNP and then real posts end up at the bottom of the pile so the only think people read are crazy counter opinions. How can people think that 50% of the population don't have any reason to vote LNP other than "they are manipulated by the media"?
14. It's the biggest echo chamber ever! All the poeple are saying it!
15. LNP has always caused more debt so to give them credit for anything to do with debt or the economy is pretty insane.
16. Personally I like miles, and labour is my first pick, but good on you for choosing independents. Voting independents is the only way we can make our system less of a two party shithole.
17. Oh don't get me wrong I know they all fucking suck but I know it'll be one of the 2 that will win and lnp seems to be a lot worse. Legalise weed all the way baby haha
18. The absolute state of reddit that this gets you a downvote. The ALP’s shameless pork barrelling is going to mean that a lot of improvements won’t end up getting done in Qld if they get in — the trade off for 50c public transport fares and school lunches for everyone is that there will be less money going around for infrastructure like public transport and health system improvement. The way they have let the union movement dictate construction in the state also means it is more expensive to do business in qld than anywhere else — again meaning fewer building projects and when they happen they’re more expensive. The ABS notes that the number of union stop work days in Qld is 4 times that of Victoria for example, another Labor state. Consider if you will what this means for the ability to build affordable housing, or new road and rail infrastructure. The waste of time and money Labor has put in when it comes to the Olympics has been shameful. There remains enormous risk that if they get another term they would still get nothing done or put in place some terrible solution like a major stadium in place of QE2 where there is no supporting infrastructure. All of these things are things I think the LNP will do better. Having said all that - I wouldn’t trust the Cristifulli as far as I could throw him. While he has said no changes to abortion, it just seems wildly unbelievable to me. He seems to have a policy of do nothing and there is a real risk he is Campbell Newman lite. I will say, despite what you read on here, there has certainly been spikes in house break ins and stolen cars in the last 4 years. The AFR suggested that 46% of people they surveyed have experienced a crime or know someone directly that has in the past year. People on here will dispute there is any spike in this sort of crime but if you look at the stats properly it is clear there has been a rise. There does need to be something done about it and I’m not sure Labor have the ticker to act on it. So that’s where I stand on it. I’ll probably still vote Labor, but for me it’s a case of how can I send a message that Labor needs to reign in unions and pork barrelling, vs not get lumped with Cristifulli creating some sort of dystopian nightmare. A real choice of a shit sandwich or a giant douche
19. Nick Xenophon was the last politician that I genuinely liked, and that I thought actually cared about people.
20. I mean, when it comes to the choices for this election, One Nation or Family First aren't much better than LNP or especially Labour?
21. Dude, no. Family First and One Nation are batshit insane cunts who go last. Do not give them even a preferential vote. When voting, it goes- 1. The ones you actually want 2. Labor 3. LNP 4. Batshit insane cunts If you give batshit insane cunts a vote, it will encourage LNP to adopt their policies.
22. Nah I put them last, but someone needs to be second last
23. I hope so
24. It looks like the most likely outcome is an LNP minority government with KAP picking up seats (though that is only slightly ahead of a slim minority LNP government). It looks like the LNP landslide has vanished. Hopefully they dont do too much damage to the state when in power but im not hopeful.
25. Sportsbet are still showing odds 8:1 if Labor wins if you want to throw a few dollars on just in case.
26. Honestly praying for a lnp minority government meaning it’ll be hard af to do any of the draconian shit they want to do.
27. Want to know how? Take a look at the funding coming from the coal industry. It's the same thing that happened when Rudd tried to tax the resources industry. It turns out money can polish a turd. https://preview.redd.it/4h94une07twd1.png?width=1026&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a118a03edd88c9c9a11b5ccfb1a93ce75d9e7be That doesn't even include the funding going to non-party pro-LNP campaigns.
28. Because there's a not insignificant number of people who think after a government has been in a while we should give the other mob a go. Policy doesn't seem to be high on the agenda as they are low information.
29. Someone told me it's about youth crime. That's why they're voting them in.
30. I honestly think people it’s because people blame the effects of a global pandemic on the local government and the lnp is mostly backed by right wing conservatives and boomers who don’t need to worry about rising cost of housing, education, and healthcare. Sadly, they’re often the ones who religiously vote
31. People are completely unengaged and apathetic to the whole process. Hence they vote on core beliefs or values that they think align with one of the teams. It’s a consequence of the complete capitulation of the Labor Party and the trade union movement during the 1970s and 1980s into neoliberalism and class collaboration, the agenda that Bob Hawke and Paul Keating enacted.
32. A lot of people still seem to harbour a lot of anger over the whole Voice referendum and want to punish Labor accordingly. Best way to spite them? Vote for the opposition, even if it means voting against the interests of a large chunk of our population.
33. I think the 2023 referendum did a lot of damage QLD Labor. People don’t forget their local members were shoving it down their throats and Annastacia ballsing up and fucking off when the going got tough.
34. A partial explanation in ten seconds: https://youtu.be/K_LvRPX0rGY?si=wd3ILnxDlhyuOvDx
35. The media tells them to
36. Some of their policies that aren’t being covered in much depth in the media, but which are pretty hard to find fault with: 1. Increasing protected areas across the state. 2. Publishing key performance indicators for government services and reporting on progress. 3. Reforming the right to information process. 4. Reforming the estimates process. 5. Strengthening the independence of the integrity commissioner. 6. Strengthening the independence of the auditor general. 7. Appointing a minister for open data and a minister for integrity in government.
37. Because Anastasia overshadows everything. She made Miles look like a grinning lapdog who deserved no respect. He acted like an arrogant frat boy talking at people and talking shit instead of listening. She did him wrong by staying in so long. I actually think he is really trying and I think he's worked out that being a leader doesn't mean being a lying dictator POS like she was. She opened her mouth and all that came out was lies. He seems to have settled into the role and if he'd had another 6 months may have been able to outrun her stench. There is a reason she is persona non grata for his campaign. He probably should have cut Albanese out too. Made it more vote for Steven Miles with a distant ALP tag and less vote ALP ALP ALP. If you are a Labor supporter you don't need to see the party tag all the time. But people like me who are desperate to find someone actually worthy of my vote - I might be convinced by the person. I also find it amusing that apart from signs in my area I have yet to see or hear anything from anyone up for election.
38. Strong propaganda and a population of people with little to no media and political literacy. It's really easy to underestimate just how many folk go about their lives "head empty, no thoughts"
39. You don’t win elections. The current guy looses it and you’re just next in line. Labor is loosing it and LNP are next in line.
40. [deleted]
41. In my opinion it’s crime that has boosted LNP’s chances, people are scared. Labor keep saying crime is down, but where is the proof? The continuing story of youth of bail or good behaviour bonds reoffending while Miles keeps claiming that it’s not happening. People don’t always need results to be happy, sometimes they just need to see intentions to solve the problem.
42. Like marginalised children with trauma histories are the cause of the states problems… laughed at ‘ pearl clutchers’ because that’s exactly how they seem. I also find it amusing that the media portrays these children as some group of organised criminals when the majority of them are angry, bored, and opportunistic who fucking post their offending on social media .
43. The same bookies who paid out early on Shorten.....
44. There's no such thing. It's just rational voting as it was intended. Calling yourself a swing voter makes you sound more important, though.
45. They actually forgot the positive stuff. A party has to sell the good no matter what (because lobby groups can't run a "this is why you should vote for X" campaign alone - because people ask "why doesn't X tell me this?". You can get away with letting other parties tear each other apart, but Katter, Pauline, Labor and the Green's aren't going to campaign for you. Which means Crisafulli is "who?" to many people. They at least kind of have an image of Miles, but Crisafulli you go on looks. And he's not Hemsworth, he looks more like someone from marketing or sales, who might be a pain to get rid of if you aren't looking to be solicited. Where is the backgrounding, LNP?
46. People are angry (especially in rural non Brisbane city areas) because youth crime has been getting screamed as an issue (Townsville and Cairns especially) for a long time and labor sat on it until 12 months before the election. What labor is doing now may be working but I know there’s a lot of people saying too little too late. On issues other than youth crime, Labor have focused on Brisbane city with cheap fares, turning their backs on mining and farming communities and focusing the Olympics. Regional are very disenfranchised and I will be surprised if labor win many seats outside the city where labor’s focus has the most benefits.
47. Exactly. Why would you want a new Prime Minister every month and constant squabbling like it used to be.
48. 👆👆👆 You got it. BTW it's Labor. We have the silly American spelling lmao
49. Why is it blue or red? Why not green or another independent? Look at the US with their black and white parties: you're either with us or you're the enemy. I vote for independents or minor parties because I'm entirely disenfranchised by the two majors. I sure as shit don't agree with a single LNP policy but Labor doesn't really give a shit beyond the basics either.
50. Because they either don't know or don't remember.
51. Sorry dude but if you're not going to take the democratic process seriously yourself then it's a bit rich to start making claims about the way anyone else votes. Your vote is an important thing and there are marked differences between the major parties. For example, the LNP are very clear that they want to reduce mining royalties--essentially a tax cut for mining companies.Labor want to continue to tax them as they are currently doing and rightly so because the resources they take from the land belong to Queenslanders and those royalties go into funding useful stuff like 50c fares, free school lunches etc
52. Some of the independents running are even more cooked than the LNP
53. Don’t buy into the “both parties are shit” narrative. It’s pure ignorance and smug cynicism.
54. Australia is 20 to 30 years behind the USA on a lot of our ideas and policies We can see what's happening over there right now, in real time. We have a chance to change the path we're on and vote these fascist picks in to oblivion. A vote for LNP is a vote for trumpism. Pure and simple.
55. People are lazy and fall into habits or do what their parents did. The average person doesn't take any time out of their day to look at what policies parties are pushing and just take what is fed to them by the news, almost every major media outlet is an LNP shill, hence why they default into voting for LNP.
56. Honestly you're probably not too far from the truth. It seems that both big party leaders here in Queensland seem to be just as bad as each other. I have resorted to voting for independents as my first preference in recent years, as I feel the big parties no longer stand for the values they once did. Although in saying that, in very simple terms LNP and ALP have some difference. I'll probably cop some hate for this, but I couldn't care less. ALP for the most part tend to spend a lot of money on welfare, public transport, education... which in the short term makes people happy. The problem with spending lots of money, is that it will eventually come back to bite the taxpayers in the long run. In that if you spend lots of money (sometimes money you don't have), you will have to pay it back eventually. But as a benefit they do make life a little easier for people, leaning on the side of a bigger government body, more progressive social/moral stances and tend to have a bit more of a globalist perspective on the world in recent times. LNP on the other hand tend to be more conservative in the ways they do things, both economically and at times morally/socially. They are normally economically conservative, so they put limits on public spending, to reduce government debt. This normally comes in the form of privatisation, tax reforms and focus on big business and high income earners as a way to increase jobs and investors. The LNP also believes in smaller government, which is why you'll see them closing down parts of government or public sectors that they don't see as beneficial or rather more beneficial as private sector industries. Their policies usually reflect a push against long term reliance on government, so you'll see policies about self reliance rather than government dependance. Morally/socially they tend to align more for religious Christians or general conservatives, this their push for abortion policies. Protection for faith based schools... So in essence, ALP benefit in the short term, but do damage to the economy in the long run unfortunately. LNP will be seen to be making life harder in the short term, but arguably more beneficial in the long run. Obviously there are differences on both sides, something like negative gearing from ALP I would argue is a conservative economic reform. Strangely the LNP is not in support of it seems. I think this is definitely seen more on a federal level then a state level. State level can be hard to gauge or see how this occurs sometimes. But as people have been aware of lately, things are coming out especially things about abortion, youth crime, housing...
57. It’s not just old males. Some of the most staunch life long LNP voters are women, and Qld is full of them. They think that a Sky news opinion jockey (aka Tony Abbots former advisor) “should be running the country” as they sit back on the deck of their 3 million dollar house that their estranged adult children have never visited.
58. Can you elaborate? What choice are they planning on taking away from women?
59. Thanks for the chuckle
60. Gotta be honest, you don't don't sound like a swing voter in the comments. Maybe you swing between ALP and greens or something but you seem to have a distaste for LNP (THIS IS NOT A BAD THING) LNP are ass which is why I'm not a swing voter (maybe I'll vote independent sometimes). To the question, people in desperation as the commenter hinted their community may be aren't voting on policies. They are probably pissed off at the lack of visibility of their issues and the fact nothing has been done. It doesn't matter if LNP are better or worse the important thing is not voting for the people who aren't helping you. To be completely honest I would do the same thing. I wouldn't vote for a party that had neglected my region and people for years. But I still wouldn't vote LNP lol.
61. I got LNP's flyer in the mail today, "Adult Time for Adult Crimes!" splashed across it. I looked into it and they don't seem to have any actual plan aside from, "let's throw kids in jail". It's all just dog whistles and fear-mongering to appeal to their base. What about cost of living? Rental crisis? Housing affordability? Colesworth price gouging? *crickets*
62. Youth criminals don't steal AMGs and bmws to put food on the table lol
63. Dutton's been awfully quiet on this because people started to talk about the fact that he has a freakin $400-MILLION property and childcare portfolio. Dutton, the former cop, who mysteriously still won't tell us why he had to leave the police force. I don't trust him as far as I can throw him.
64. Mate if that's your opinion then that fine but i think you are being very disingenuous with this post. If you don't want to go to their website or facebook or courier mail comments section then you're not actually looking for an answer to your question you just want to validate your existing beliefs. Youth crime is a perfect example. Reddit will just tell you it is all scare tactics and about locking up kids however the actual plan includes prevention and rehabilitation programs that would be very helpful in regional areas. Do I believe they actually have a detailed and costed rehabilitation plan for youth criminals? NO. Is it something that on paper would help the community and would make someone vote for him? YES.
65. Its actually not a bad idea for OP, if they are genuinely seeking an alternative perspective. People really shouldn't be against that either, it should be self-evident (and I believe that it is self-evident) that Labor is the right choice. Listening to other people who genuinely have a case for the LNP shouldn't change that, it should strengthen your position - or maybe you aren't as confident in it as you think you are.
66. That is an interesting story. Do you think its true? Are Labor objectively the bastions of truth, justice and all that is good while the other are Marvel-movie villains out to get us? Or might that be just a minor simplification on your part in order to make life easier on yourself? Maybe, just maybe, parties could be right on some things, and wrong on others.
67. So given it's a foregone conclusion that they'll win, you're saying you're going to continue being a cunt. Great...
68. Considering the size of their recorded profits, and that we’re only taxing at 25% I feel like that well is far from dry from dry hole. But I totally see your point.
69. Borrowing for infrastructure is good. You end up with an asset worth more than the borrowings. Borrowing for tax cuts is bad. You end up with no asset and an inflationary environment.
70. \> The answer to every election cant be 'everyone else but me is stupid' Figure 1.
71. >Come Saturday night, it'll be a meltdown in here. Yep it's gonna be a shit-show and I can't wait.
72. Nope not at all I dont think it has a pro-labor bias at all.
73. Regardless of who you support - youth crime is a major issue. Police closing cases based on pressuring individuals to do so as not to impact their solved cases and general crime occurrence in an area is the reason numbers often look better than they are. They have KPIs to hit as well - and much like a sales role they’re always expected to be better than the previous year. Youth crime is happening more. The general population isn’t crazy in assuming so.
74. If a conscience vote were to happen, which would be the worst case scenario, it would easily be defeated. For abortion laws to be repealed in Queensland it would require an ultra conservative MP to go rogue and everyone from the major parties to secretly agree with and support them on something that is deeply unpopular in the community and politically untenable The reality is abortion is not part of any major party platform in Queensland and the majority of MPs from Libs/Labor are moderate on the issue and have no desire for change to the legislation
75. What policies mate? The only policies are Fuck Children, Fuck Women's rights, Fuck the first nations people and line the pockets of their biggest donators. Literally, that's what it boils down to. There is nothing else outside of what is "standard operating practice' of a sitting government. Seriously, enlighten us. Because not a single "LNP" Stan has been able to articulate a researched and factual response. Not a singe one. Go for it... we are waiting
76. [deleted]
77. People are unaware. They are LNP and don't know what they are voting for. Best method is to tell friends and family.
78. We only knew Anastasia and what she did not Steven and Cambell Newwnan was long ago and David maybe will be different from then ..Time will tell as they all lie!!
