Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Prescription drugs are worae
2. Where does harm reduction live on your left/right/libertarian equation?
3. The election we just had kinda proves people can't be trusted to know what's in their best interest. We just replaced a progressive government giving back to the people of QLD with one that doesn't even have a costed budget, just slogans. If that's not acting against your self interest I don't know what is
4. I am also deeply confused and none of the answers anyone’s providing are enlightening
5. what happens if you jump out of a helicopter with a parachute on?
6. Just like our helicopter analogy, having a parachute can give pilots a sense of security, but it doesn’t eliminate the fundamental risks of flying. In the same way, pill testing can help identify dangerous substances, but it doesn’t address the underlying issues of addiction and risky behaviors linked to drug use. It serves as a temporary measure rather than a complete solution.
7. Because it doesn't suit your agenda .... ?
8. You're generous. I would've said IQ you can count on your fingers.
9. We know what is in prescription drugs, without pill testing we don’t know what is in recreational drugs.
10. the shit (LNP) would hit the fan (helicopter blades)
11. I’m a pilot and that is factually incorrect.
12. https://preview.redd.it/1md5nafjzmxd1.jpeg?width=567&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8abbec9ec02736da0ee8021ef80449db62913bd8
13. No because it's just garbage. A better analogy is comparing pill testing too having a second person inspect your parachute before jumping out of a plane. You're doing something inherently risky in the safest manor possible.
14. Because it's a bad analogy for anyones agenda especially yours fucking lmao.
15. Exactly
16. You’re obsessed buddy nobody is talking about that in this thread.
17. Some Russian Helicopter use ejection seats and parachutes - **Kamov Ka-50** and Ka -52. Are you really a pilot ?
18. go back and read the parent thread you absolute door knob
19. this is the literal start of the thread "It is like asking pilots of helicopters to wear parachutes ...."
20. You’re literally just asking chat gpt to make arguments for you. It’s cringe man, time to retire from the internet old buddy
21. If you read two comments up I actually just said that btw.
22. That doesn’t have anything to do with the LNP you obsessed weirdo.
23. fuck you are so stupid mate
24. Looking at your profile/comments you’re a serious weirdo man. Keep moving big cheese
25. Good first start. But a lot more bus routes need to terminate at busways and train lines. Hub and spoke is the way to go for a city like Brisbane
26. Bus review or Metro for the Centenary suburbs please
27. Blaming labor for his own administrations inaction yet again
28. >Three routes that the council said had low customer demand – the 28, 145 and P151 – would be cut entirely, while another three pairs of routes – 124/125, 174/175, and 184/185 – would be merged. Ah yes, the 28 that frequently has standing loads, has "Low Customer Demand". I call bullshit, not that I think the change they're making with the 28 is a bad one.
29. He complained about lack of services when 50c fares were introduced and that it was a terrible idea by Labor. Miraculously, new services and routes are all of a sudden happening.
30. What happened to the bus the cityglider type bus that was supposed to service Hamilton? Yet again it’s 2024 in a big city and theres no trains after 8pm and only hourly buses after 8pm. Poor.
31. Archive (Non paywall) version https://archive.md/ogHpr
32. whats the new route between indro and Fairfield?
33. There are still entire suburbs in brisbane with absolutely no bus coverage.
34. Has anyone ridden this thing? What's it like ?
35. For the love of all that is decent in this world please just run more buses over the Story bridge and into the city from *that* side. Hell, send some down to the Valley at the same time. Getting from e.g. Stones Corner, Morningside or Coorparoo into the City or Valley area is a ballache and it really shouldn't be. Bus services don't need to all run through Southbank!
36. How TF are they fitting a Metro in the CBD underground?
37. So like … nothing for the northern suburbs?!
38. The interactive map at https://caportal.com.au/bcc/brisbane-metro is very useful for seeing the changes on a map. It shows all bus routes, and you can zoom in to an area to see which buses go nearby. Although it doesn't seem to show the bus stops, only the routes.
39. cool, can the buses between Caboolture and Morayfield now kindly at the very *least* go until 9pm so i might be able to enjoy a nighttime movie without needing an uber
40. We could definitely use more loops, especially as we get more mixed use development away from the cbd
41. The best we can do is a big tunnel.
42. You say that like you’re completely unaware of how TransLink works
43. Haha what? Translink is the reason...
44. Well you see that still under it's business case. [https://caportal.com.au/bcc/brisbane-metro](https://caportal.com.au/bcc/brisbane-metro) (Search GCG) That same business case that was completed 18 months ago, and resulted in the Gold CityGlider being fully funded ready for operation last FY. [https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/new-gold-cityglider-bus-route-and-battery-powered-ferry-for-brisbane-20230614-p5dgfq.html](https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/new-gold-cityglider-bus-route-and-battery-powered-ferry-for-brisbane-20230614-p5dgfq.html)
45. Would it be going through grace graceville and over the indro bridge perhaps?
46. Well it's just a regular bus. I personally don't like them as although they don't have an internal combustion engine: * They have a high pitched squeal from the motors which, * The Stop bell is a loud disruptive honk, that physically hurts my ears * The braking is jerky * Dwell Times have increased and the buses are slower than their diesel counterparts * Most of the increase in capacity is in standing room, with 64 seats compared to 63 on the buses they replace, so you're still as likely as ever to stand * They smell like chemicals or something which isn't nice. * They amplify bumps in the busway, particularly the one going into greenslopes and it throws the back compartments around a fair bit. * There is very little seating on the ground, so even though they're "Low Floor", a similar amount of seating is low floor compared to current buses. * And to fit in 1 more seat compared to existing buses, it feels like they really compromised on leg room, which is practically non-existent * They also used bucket seats which are more uncomfortable than the bench seating on recent buses. On on the positives: * The doors slide open which is nice, but there is only 3 of them, like other articulated buses despite the increased capacity, which causes some minor issues. * Because they don't have many seats, they're nice and open * They are pretty quiet when the motors aren't running. Overall, they're not bad, but they're certaintly not good either.
47. That's why the Adelaide St tunnel was required
48. Probably need to ask your own council about that
49. more loops, and better timing for the routes traveling in the opposite direction.
50. You seem to be the one unaware of how Translink works. These changes to be released yesterday would've had to be approved before the government entered caretaker mode, so it's taken at least a month for this to release. But the reality is actually much worse. The network was actually approved in March, revealed in a since deleted post from the transport chair ryan murphy, where he said we would get 5 new routes, which this document reveals is the case. So it's taken the BCC 7 months to release that glossy document. But it doesn't end there, the network that was approved was for operation from november 2024. Currently there is no start date for it, and rumors put it at February next year. So at least a 3 month delay. You can't really try and blame Translink for councils inability to deliver bi-articulated buses and some busway station upgrades in 8 years.
51. It goes around yeronga and over indro bridge.
52. I don't suppose there's any chance bikes are allowed on?
53. The chemical smell is just because they're new - it'll dissipate pretty quickly.
54. You’re projecting quite a bit there. Or at least arguing against a straw man.
55. Nope. They're buses and buses don't allow bikes, unless they're all folded up in a bag.
56. We did the Bris to Regional Vic move. The weather is a lot different down here, far less humidity, but can still get hot, but for not as long. The diversity, food options in Melbourne are great. The transport is pretty good, honestly, better than Brisbane. I think everyone always complains, especially if they don't know any different. The traffic in Melbourne is far worse than Brisbane (well it was, reports from people still there are that Brisbane traffic has gotten far worse since we lived there). We wanted to move to Melbourne for quite a while, but when Covid hit, made the decision to move to a regional hub. I cant comment on what Glenroy is like unfortunately. Good Luck in your search.
57. Hi mate, I wanted to buy in Brisbane but moved to Melbourne because I could afford it. Melbourne is way better bang for buck, the weather is shithouse but the city itself has so much more going on that I’ve found it to be a compromise I can handle. I got a 2 bedder in a nice suburb 4km from the CBD for 550k, whereas in Brisbane anything on the budget would take you out somewhere really inconvenient and/or awful
58. I’m from Melbourne, lived there for 33 years, lived overseas for 3 and have been in Brisbane for 8. I love Brisbane and could never move back to Melbourne. But it really depends on your priorities. I love the climate here, the lifestyle and pace. We have so much going on culturally, festivals, markets, outdoor stuff and you can enjoy that year round. Melbourne I find is tough. It has better nightlife, sure, but if that’s not your scene then what are you left with? I also find Melbourne pretty depressing these days, especially post covid. Admittedly it was better on my last visit in March, compared to the visit I had two years ago, partly because the weather was good but also because people are starting to come out of their covid trauma and living again. Also, if you haven’t moved to a new city before be aware it takes at least 2 years to settle in.
59. As a former Melbournite (left in 2019), I'd probably suggest lowering your sights and staying in Brisbanem, unless you really want to shift to Melbourne for its own sakes. Glenroy is... not great, to be honest - depending on how close you are to the train station (closer is better, obviously). You are sandwiched between airports and freeways, and the neighbouring suburb of Broadmeadows has a particularly grim reputation. Anything you can get in there for mid-300s isn't going to be great. I'd recommend dropping the townhouse requirement, and looking at flats instead - even 1br if you must. In terms of the differences between the two cities - obviously Melbourne has more to do, it's a bit more 'grown up' as such, and its public transport network is better, but the traffic is worse, the weather is obviously worse, and the proximity to beaches and forest is a real plus for Brisbane. All the typical differences between a city of 2.5m and one of 5m, obviously. Don't discount the difficulty of re-making a support network in a new city, by the way. It does take a few years, especially once you're mid-20s or later.
60. As a southern that has moved and bought a house here the only thing I had to get used to was the hot climate and humid months. I’m used to it now, the traffic is noticeably a lot less and manageable. We get free ambulance coverage if in the event you have an emergency which I’ve had to use twice so far. The roads are amazingly maintained (can only comment on the northside).
61. Brisbane is the second most expensive place in the country. You could live anywhere else except Sydney for less.
62. Moved to Melbs from Brisbane this year. Got better bang for our buck in terms of property and location with pretty great PT options. The weather is not as bad as people would have you believe. Now it’s getting warmer, the city and inner burbs are really coming alive, like Edinburgh Gardens was heaving with people at 6:30 the other night. There’s more appreciation of the good weather than Brisbane, which takes it for granted. I love not opening the door to a wave of humidity at 8am. Cannot speak to Glenroy though
63. One surprising thing - it takes just as long to get to the proper surf beaches in Melbourne, as it does in Brisbane. I’d say traffic is as bad as Brisbane. Public transport is vastly superior in Melbourne. The cafe and food scene is a cut above Brisbane still (Brisbane catching up tho). If ur a 4wd outdoorsy BCF kinda person, it’s not for you. But if you like a bit of culture/food/stuff to do, it’s awesome. One major thing about units/apartments in Melbourne - avoid new builds or those giant dog boxes in the sky. Terrible quality, and there’s an over supply so you won’t get any capital growth. Go for ur classic brick apartment or an art deco (but beware of concrete cancer and make sure there is a well funded sinking fund). Edit: i suggest u airbnb in Glenroy for a weekend to see if u like it, before u commit all that money. The suburbs get quite grim feeling the further out u go in Melbourne, unlike Brisbane.
64. [deleted]
65. Feels. Just had 2 offers in woodridge get knocked back for offers 80k over mine 😅
66. True, but Vic ambo coverage is all of $50/year IIRC - small change in the context of moving states.
67. On a like-for-like basis, I can unfortunately assure you that Melbourne is still pricier.
68. Just had 2 offers on places in Woodridge get turned down by much higher offers, so hard to feel hopeful in Brisbane at this rate 😅 I'm a cold climate person so Melb weather doesn't scare me at all, and the general night-life and culture is also my jam
69. I'm a city/urban kinda person, give me cafes and culture every day of the week. Also not a beach person so proximity to ocean isn't important. This one I'm looking at is a brick block, realestate.com says its build in the 70s. What's concrete cancer? Off to Google that one. The airbnb idea is great!
70. Hard disagree. Getting a foot on that ladder is critical in the Australian economy.
71. What a time to be alive 😂 that happened to me too
72. The night life and culture was a huge draw card for me too. Even out on the edges of the inner suburbs there’s still plenty happening, like I’m 8-9km from the city and there’s venues, cool restaurants and bars and breweries within walking distance
73. 70’s brick is generally alright. A building and pest inspection should identify concrete cancer. The property market is very soft in Melbourne at the moment, so you can play hardball as a buyer. Especially in apartments. Good luck!
74. So envious, drives me nuts how early Brisbane closes, even on weekends
75. Yeah I've noticed it's been trending down according to some articles I've read. Thinking I might head down and offer 5-10k under what I initially offered just to see what they say
76. Have been saving a for a first home for a few years now and house prices are out pacing the growth of our deposit. It's pretty heart breaking.
77. I'm no rocket scientist but I did some googling and opened a calculator. This might help if you need to explain to older generations why it is so hard to get into the market. (tip when explaining, don't try to downplay that they didn't struggle, they did, but people are struggling even harder now): **(Brisbane)** **2024** Median house price: $840,000 Deposit (20%): $168,000 Median wage: $80,000 per year Time taken to save deposit (20% of wage per week): 10.5 years **2000** Median house price: $180,000 Deposit (20%): $36,000 Median wage: $34,000 per year Time taken to save deposit (20% of wage per week): 5.5 years **1980** Median house price: $40,000 Deposit (20%): $8000 Median wage: $14,000 Time taken to save deposit (20% of wage per week): 2.9 years To me it boils down to the fact that house prices have risen much more sharply over the years than wages have.
78. Almost a one milli city. Insane. Good luck to the first home buyers and good luck to the renters. Melbourne's keeping theirs pretty flat. Is there still a population shift out of Melbourne or is this from reducing investors?
79. I give up, worked all my life to basically have nothing. Fuck it.
80. Failure of government at all levels!
81. It is extremely depressing. So many low-end, old small homes that would be perfect for first home buyers to fix up while living there have been snapped up and renoed by flippers and investors. I've been to some of these auctions where it's clear the buyers are not going to live there, just beating out young families and couples for another investment property. Even apartments are fucking skyrocketing, 75%+ increases over a few years. Tough times if you're not on 120k a year or got some family money to back you up.
82. Brisbane is about 7-10years behind Sydney. After moving to Brisbane I decided to go back to Sydney as it has better infrastructure and wages. While it's more unaffordable, it literally feels I'm Brisbane like everyone is having the exact same conversations about housing sydneysiders had 7-10 years ago. Sydneysiders now appear to have come to some kind of acceptance and don't seem to talk about it as much as they used to and are just enjoying the city they have post covid. The frenzy will continue in Brisbane is my prediction until all those crumbling queenslanders are renovated,, other okder houses duplexed the fk out of and properties are flipped till the median is $1.5m +
83. The older gen can get fucked if I ever hear anything like “it was hard back in my day” like get fucked
84. Brisbane no longer a “affordable” city. No more migration here because “it’s cheaper”. Melbourne is the affordable city now!!
85. We just bought a small house in the Sunshine Coast hinterland that’s walking distance to a train station, which was literally the best we could do. Everywhere in Brisbane even as far up as Caboolture within our price range was either run down or nowhere near public transport infrastructure. We are incredibly lucky to be in a position where we only need to commute to the city 2-3 days a week, and honestly I think that’s the future of home ownership in SEQ. I know so many people who have been priced out of Brisbane and moved out to Yarrabilba, Flagstone, Ripley or even further west. It’s a tough decision but we decided we’d rather have a 1:10 commute than watch rent go up and up and up while also watching houses slip further and further out of our reach 🤷‍♂️
86. I'm sure the new liberal government will do everything they can to lower the cost of living, reduce house prices, and make our lives easier. Jokes - let's just lock up kids and privatise everything instead.
87. Went to an inspection a few months ago where the place had been sprayed top to bottom with white paint and new floors had gone in, couldn't have been more than $30k of work done to the place. It was a joke. Plenty of slugs walking through with their phones in the air doing remote inspections for people. The place was bought for mid $700s and sold for mid $900s. Not a bad way to make $200k. I feel for whoever bought the place because the shitshow was going to cost $200k to bring up to any kind of standard.
88. Young people such as myself are cooked. It’s never good news in regards to the future.
89. I've seen multiple 1million+ sales in FOREST LAKE. 3bed, 1bath, 1 storey homes that haven't been touched for 30 years. It's fucking insane.
90. At this point why should we even give a shit, we can't do anything. The politicians have investment properties so do their rich friends. I don't mean to be a negative pessimistic ass but Australia seems so fucking slow to change shit it's exhausting. Like what are our options besides voting for another random cunt with multiple houses.
91. My wife and I own our house, properties around our area are selling for around AU$1M, I didn’t think be a millionaire would feel so, underwhelming. Property prices are too expensive
92. At the middle of the market there seems to be a lot sitting. Lots of overpriced junk. There will always be rich people with cash to splash on the fancy stuff.
93. failure of government across all levels!!
94. Maybe I should just move to another country
95. Record.....for NOW! Just wait until 4 years of LNP control! I expect 1.5 million by the end of that 4 years.
96. My former rental in Nudgee recently sold for over $1 million. That gets you a one story four bedroom with no insulation and a tiny yard. Could justify the price if you were getting a mini mansion instead of a glorified shack.
97. Makes for sad reading. But it's the faux outrage and shock from some owners who make it really annoying. "Oh, it's so crazy, I would hate to be trying to buy a place these days." The exact same people I also hear "well, we bought our place a few years ago and the place across the street on a much smaller block, less bedrooms and needing work went for $1.5M so our place would be well more than that especially since we installed the pool". Lots of people like to pretend they're empathetic towards people trying to put a roof over their heads, but in reality, they're not. I've got a really good young guy working with me, Engineer starting out in his career, not much family here. Had to leave his rental as the owners were selling and he came 3 days away from having to live in his car before he secured a rental for himself. As he said to me - what's the point in all this? I was told when I was younger that if I work hard, study hard and save hard it will pay off and I will be rewarded some day - I can barely cover the rent due to how expensive it is not to mind buying my own place for the security of starting a family one day". Pretty depressing hearing that from the younger generation.
98. The cost of buying a property is crazy! For example, the place next door to me is a rental, and it just sold for $1.4m. Here's the crazy part... assuming that the buyers (investors) had 20% deposit, that would be a loan amount of $1.12m. Which is approximately $6000/month in interest. The place is rented at $680/week. So, even if you were to buy it and only pay interest payments, it would cost more than double a month to own. Now throw on top of that principal repayments, to make sure you are paying down the mortgage!!!
99. Love that for us. With our stagnant wage growth and the growing divide between the upper and working class. We're doing so well.
100. Stop letting OS investors buy our houses and land
101. "yeah nah just fuckin stop spending cunt" - people who bought houses at half that price
102. I bought my first house in the 90s for $139K which was about 4 times my salary at the time. I remember lying in bed and the weight of owing the bank that much money was so heavy. It must be terrifying starting out these days. That house on [realeastate.com.au](http://realeastate.com.au) is estimated just shy of $1 million. That is over 10 times the salary of someone doing a similar job to what I was doing back then.
103. It makes me sad for my children and their peers
104. Just bought for 975. Can confirm.
105. May as well just add 5k more not like most of us will ever be able to afford it anyway.
106. It's increasingly looking like a bubble. I'd be very cautious
107. With an average house now in a decent suburb costing around $1.2M it's ridiculous that the state government still only has the first home buyers grant at $750k; it should be unlimited and not need to be a new build. I looked around Brisbane and you can't get a house + land for under $750k within the whole Brisbane City Council area. Stamp duty should also not apply to first homes, since the state gets enough tax money with charging 10% GST on everything.
108. I was on the bus yesterday & saw a sold sign at the front of this house. Main road, sold for just under 1.2m. Shit's fucked. https://preview.redd.it/u2kgssm0grxd1.jpeg?width=3056&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96f32a971874120497c23a74d1c8bd8ef33f83ca
109. Don't worry guys - lnp will fix it
110. And they'll just keep going up the closer we get to the Olympics.
111. I'd rather be homeless than service that 30 year loan.
112. A guy told me him and his wife are saving for a deposit. They are up to $800K in savings now.
113. Yeah the housing market is so rough for FHB in brissy. We really wanted decent sized land, and a house that wasn’t falling apart. We ended up purchasing a home in the Redlands for a painful $850k 🥲 it’s still around a 50/1hr commute for me for the couple days I’m In the city. Even though a lot of it is out of my control, I still can’t help feel like I should have done better sooner 🥲
114. ☠️
