Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. How is letting an attempted murder during a break in walk away without incarceration the best result of the justice system? You can treat poverty at the same time as punishing crime, they aren't exclusive Majority of people know right from wrong, and making excuses for people is gaslighting the victims and quite frankly insulting
2. If they have nothing to lose, hand over their freedom to roam the streets and get back to me
3. I've been to far too many epic parties to ever be allowed to run for parliment
4. Singapore (with one of the lowest crime rate in the world) may disagree with you. They use strict punishments as a deterrent for committing crimes and it seems to work.
5. Seems like the parents need jail if their under age kids are committing violence or property theft. They should at least be automatically financially responsible for the damage and secondary effects. Working decades in retail, I've never seen bad kids that didn't have enabling parents. Adult crime, parents do time.
6. And they are repealing those laws in the US after realising that they were inhumane.
7. What? The comment said LNP was voted in because of people like Debbie, but literally up until the day before the election people said Debbies were made up and an agenda pushed by the media. So which is it? Debbie’s are made up or Debbie’s voted in the LNP?
8. she’s not old enough. she’s only 62 so they told us to rely on ndis. ndis are saying that her diagnosis isn’t strong enough. they don’t believe us that she’s about as capable of caring for herself as a newborn, even with ex phys, gp, O.T backing. the neurologist hasn’t got a concrete diagnosis so we’re on our own
9. Ramping in Qld is the worst in the country, currently.
10. And cut mining royalties which were funding some of the hospital upgrades!
11. You're blaming a party that has been in power for 3 of the last 30 years? Instead of the one who's been in power for 27 years, including the last decade, for the state of the health system? That's truely delusional.
12. Our local base hospital in one area has a short wait list. It is always within the acceptable number of patients. A specialist we saw was lamenting that he has waiting to have their referrals opened for extended periods. I didn't get it, until he explained they are fudging wait times by not opening new referrals until one clears their system to make the statistics look better. Literally they are putting peoples lives at risk to give good reports on wait times. I'm not saying this is common, but its a sad state of affairs that this is what people have to do.
13. That’s the problem. Everyone is like LNP will only make one term when everyone realises what a dumb decision they made but 4 years is enough time to absolutely wreak havoc.
14. Energy rebates, 50c public transport, and reduced vehicle registration were brought in by Miles. Mining royalties were raised that help fund public infrastructure. Mining companies pay very little comparative to profits. It's Australia's land, and international companies reap the rewards. I know the state doesn't control interest rates. I meant we are coming into a better economic period due to factors outside of what state LNP would have caused. But they will take the credit and push the narrative that they are superior. Labor brought us through and out of the pandemic.
15. If you read my comment after I said this one, I know the RBA controls interest rates you highly regarded person. My point is that rate cuts are coming and the LNP will claim benefits. Do you think the average LNP voter knows the difference between state and federal governments?
16. Yes, I know this is a federal issue. I addressed this in my next comment. The average LNP voter will not understand the difference when LNP jumps up and down about the cost of living stabilising and interest rates dropping. This probably won't happen anyway as LNP (Federal) wants to keep immigration high.
17. It’s the only state with universally free ambulance too - even Tasmania has criteria where they sometimes will issue a bill to its own residents.
18. >*"NOOoNOOOO NOOOOURR NOURRR* >*I NEVA LEAVE MY HOUSEE SO NURBURD CURS ABURT URRTSS FURNDINGGGG I HAF DIS FING CULD A CUMPUTR N FISSBOOK WE DURN NEED IT!!!!!!"*
19. As a reminder, if you get an ambulance bill from any other state as well, you can send it to QAS, _and [they will pay it](https://www.qld.gov.au/emergency/emergencies-services/interstate-ambulance-treatment)_. This is unique to Queensland - even Tasmania won’t pay your ambo invoice if you get one from, say, QAS.
20. Bro, the level of environmental destruction is going to be absolutely wild. When you look back at the levels it was under newman and then where it came down to, they are going to have to 10x it just to get back to where it was back then. They are going to absolutely hog wild it will be crazy rofl
21. And insect numbers are plummeting alarmingly. And also spiders. Every year in my parents yard for the last 40 years we had heaps of golden orb weavers. I haven't seen any for two years now. I've seen one single brown beetle in two years, never seen a Christmas beetle. And we live in a regional area! I look at the caterpillars in the garden and wonder if they're a fucking endangered species :S
22. i said, that is everywhere regardless of what party is in, when i said everywhere i meant qld.
23. I bet they all love the fireworks & jet flyovers… Part of the Brisbane Festival. Funded by STATE & Local Government 🙄
24. I can guarantee you that the many who rail against tax-funded cultural infrastructure are the same people who complain about our lack of nightlife.
25. Ah another mindless redditor who thinks someone who votes conservative must be a Christian!!
26. were pretty dumb as a nation though, we voted for austerity in 1996 and haven't looked back since
27. That's the thing though. I grew up on the Gold coast, there's heaps of poor cunts who are super conservative there too. They vote against their best interests, it's so bizarre to me.
28. You're right, thanks. I'll do my best!
29. Yep. 4 is probably going to be the main focus of a lot of local branches over the coming months.
30. Simultaneously both all powerful, and powerless. It’s a rhetoric that seems very familiar if you look out over the Pacific Ocean.
31. He actually said this I’m paraphrasing go watch it on YouTube
32. Lmao hahahahah race wasn't part of my thinking. In my area there are heaps of white kids breaking into things and stealing cars. Great way to show yourself as a racist
33. Oh absolutely. That's why I said 'typically' not every or all
34. That's true but that is like saying that the younger generation have parents and grandparents and voting LNP would be better for them. Of course this is very general and your point stands for the abortion debate alone.
35. Yeah, I’m at Griffith so I can only get the 50% fares through TransLink by registering as a tertiary student. Helps a bit, but not much when I’m going through 3 zones. Appreciate the tip, hopefully someone else who can take advantage of it sees it.
36. Wow, legit haven't heard. I can't find anything googling though - do you know who's mentioned it?
37. >There's been talk of privatising them ![gif](giphy|RHInHY2dInc6uMI2ET|downsized)
38. Yeah, I don't think it's SUPER likely, but I'm just thinking of the worst case scenario. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
39. Again thered no steps to do either of these things so stop being so dramatic about something that may never happen.
40. sure mate, watch the next 4 year feel just the same if not better or slightly worse than the previous.
41. What a waste of time
42. They very much have stated it many times since the issue arose. I have heard those words clearly out of DC mouth more than once. Several times in the last week. Along with Katter saying they weren't going to put in a private members bill. That it had no priority to KAP. What part of "we will not be changing any abortion or VAD laws" don't you understand? And "no laws on Abortion will change during our term of government" and "we have no intention of changing any laws in abortion" Not sure how they could be much clearer? Along with several other LNP pollies, including Ros Bates. The LNP NEVER bought up this entire nonsense. It was Robbie Katter.
43. There are still too many influencers, real estate agents and bikies.
44. Nope. Bid was unceremoniously rejected by PVL
45. Also silly. I remember the 2019 election being called a landslide too and that was a 2 seat majority!
46. Wow, I didn’t even think of the age of consent thing. Good odds the feds would step in if they touched it at least. Civil unions are a bit less of a concern now that SSM is federally legislated, but I can see the harm to those that got a civil union pre-SSM and didn’t worry about marrying (or chose not to).
47. DC has repeatedly refused to commit to blocking a vote, or blocking a conscience vote. You are spreading disinformation.
48. I'm not saying they are. I'm saying that Miles was thrown under the bus because Anastasia knew she wasn't going to make it through this election. I'm saying that in the short time that he was in power, he tried to help with the cost of living. Which is a big cause to a lot of the other problems that QLD is dealing with. I'm pointing at the fact that the LNP hasn't shown that they have changed since they were last in power. They just sat back and let Labor dig their own grave. I'm all for change in parliament, for the right reason. But the LNP leadership doesn't give me confidence. Especially with how quiet they have been about their "plan."
49. So you’re disputing statistical facts. Literally from the first source on google. Finder is the website. Honestly baffling how some of you are so drawn to a political party as if it’s your entire identity. You must be deeply unhappy to base your whole personality on this if you’re getting this wound up over empirical data. Sky is blue as well. Happy to provide you a source on that if you need.
50. omg ur so right you got me so good 🤥🤥🤥
51. You don’t need permission to protest. Authorities have to get permission to _stop_ you protesting. The permit requirement is a notification, not a request.
52. Thank you
53. They support Hamas and Hezbollah. LNP and ALP support the other terrorist group called Israel.
54. 100% - They may need to go have a cry over a latte!
55. Your original doesn't stand at all, I'm afraid. The LNP now government majority, a party where the majority overwhelmingly don't support healthcare for women. And as you say Katter is planning to put the bill forward, to a government we know doesn't support abortion. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/18/qld-election-2024-freya-ostapovitch-lnp-stretton-candidate-abortion-ntwnfb
56. You can't know that until a vote comes up. All Crisafulli had to say was the party would vote No on repeals/amendments and he couldnt.
57. Because the last time they allowed a conscience vote on the matter a few years back all but three LNP members voted against legalising abortion. If they vote the same way again, and the KAP members also back it, that will give them the numbers needed.
58. You're willing to risk women's lives on that?
59. >‘I will work to repeal abortion laws but can’t say anything before election’: LNP candidate >“You vote for me, you trust me. I can’t say anything yet because we have got to get elected before we do anything,” she said in a conversation about abortion out the front of a pre-polling booth this week
60. It only became an issue because the LNP would not address it. All Crisafool had to do was say “we will not have a conscious vote on the matter, the LNP stands should-to-shoulder with women on their right to choice” - if he said this on day one of Katter raising it the whole thing would have gone away. KAP will raise a Bill, and LNP will have a conscious vote for members, and the Bill will pass. Crisafool will then step back and say it was all KAP and not LNP.
61. The lnp candidate from my electorate wants the laws changed.
62. We're talking about a party that wants to throw children into adult prisons and give them lifelong convictions and you still think they have the capacity to do what's morally right?
63. Katter might introduce it but it's the LNP conscience vote that will allow it to pass. This is entirely on the LNP they're just using KAP as scape goats
64. Time will tell but I have a very low bar for them, still remember Campbell Newman and that absolute disgrace of a party that was. Old mate here was in that circus so I am preparing for a buggering the next 4 years, I just hate that the major driving factor is seems is that we need a change for change sake. Make no real sense.
65. [removed]
66. ok boomer
67. Go fuck yourself, the defintion of foetus is not baby. Grt the fuck out of women’s business, it’s nothing to do with you.
68. Jann Stuckey and Steve Minnikin, apparently. Given Tim Nicholls was the third person called out, I have a bit of confidence they may be the other two - that said, Hansard is incredibly poor for accessibility. It literally doesn’t work on mobile. October 17, 2018, apparently.
69. I feel an urge to use my tech skills to create a vote tracker now - at a federal level we have “theyvoteforyou.org.au” but we have nothing at state level. I can’t can’t believe I had to resort to chatGPT coupled with “and also provide link proof”
70. I know right! And he still won.
71. No Steve miles promised cost of living relief.
72. While youth crime does exist, the media is purposefully manufacturing a panic as if every suburb is terrorised by local youth gangs. It’s easy to propagandise using emotional personal recounts from victims when the numbers tell otherwise. Also, the whole “adult crime adult time” is so brain dead. It doesn’t address the root causes of the problem and will just create more career criminals once these kids are perpetually in a cycle of recidivism since reintegrating back into society will be almost impossible. Just feels like Australians in general aren’t voting “for” something but just “against” something. Literally asking any voters, be it LNP or ALP, on what they think the policies proposed by the party they support will help the working class and you’re just met with a blank stare or just talking points against the “opponent”. Politics shouldn’t be a team sport 😭
73. Where do you live? By most accounts it is a problem in the major regional centres like Cairns, Townsville and Rockhampton. The "actual statistics" at a total crime or entire state level can quite easily hide important details.
74. If the police know that the majority of crime is committed by a few kids in each area, why do they not target them specifically to eradicate the problem?
75. Youth/gang/brown people crime goes through the roof every time Labor is in power (well reporting on it does). The Libs will introduce an unethical ineffectual law, Murdoch stops the reporting and boomers are all happy again.
76. Interesting, I have a mate who is a senior cop that says it’s absolutely as bad as the media makes out.
77. It really depends where you live, some areas are fine, some are not. Labour has been a shit show on youth crime however. Not convinced LNP will do much better, but at least they won’t raise the age a juvenile turns into an adult as far as the criminal justice system in concerned, from 17 to 18. This was Labours biggest mistake, the upper ages represent the largest cohort of serious, recidivist child offenders. By doing this, they gave these ‘kids,’ another year of ‘free hits.’ I say ‘kids’ loosely, as a six foot Pacific Islander threatening people with a Bowie knife isn’t what most people think of when they think of ‘kids.’ This obviously made the Stats for child offending go up, when ordinary these same individuals would have been captured in the adult crime stats. They really shit themselves in the foot.
78. * The total offences rate **decreased** by 6.7% * The rate of offences against the person **increased** by 4.8% * The rate of offences against property **decreased** by 7.8% * The rate of other offences **decreased** by 9.5% Less graffiti more stabbings. Less crime but
79. I’m a cop and it does exist. There are only a few really bad kids that don’t change but these ones still get bail after committing hundreds of burglaries. These specific kids shouldn’t get bail and should get rehabilitation whilst in remand. The fact is they don’t get rehabilitation until found guilty and the magistrates don’t find them guilty, just ‘no further punishment’. I’d suggest your partner isn’t in GD’s or property crime?
80. Sorry. I disagree in saying it’s not a problem. It might not be where you reside but overall, it’s very much a problem.
81. You're right, it's not an issue. As long ad You're not related to the people being killed. The problem isn't how much crime young people (statistics can bring skewed if their not being caught and charged by the way) it's the types of crimes. That is escalating. The kid that stole a car and killed an entire family with it. wasn't a first offence either. That prick should be locked up for good. I guess the grandmother stabbed and killed at Redbank doesn't count because she lived at Rddbank? Anyway I guess if it hasn't affected you it's not happening.
82. Not an issue? Tell that to the people who are victims of repeat offenders. The police aren't the problem. It's the courts allowing rats to reoffend so often that going to court is just to collect a free sandwich and a complimentary crow bar at this point.
83. The thing is, it WAS out. Stats have clearly shown that youth crime isn't an issue. The LNP just made it one.
84. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-25/david-crisafulli-walks-back-crime-victim-number-election-promise/104517750
85. The trade off is governments are elected to govern, and they are entrusted to make decisions without being roadblock so much that government stagnates
86. That’s where, if we insist we cannot have an upper house since we’re such special snowflakes (it would require a referendum to reintroduce one - it’s double-entrenched in Queensland’s constitution), the least we could do is investigate (not even do, just investigate) proportional representation systems like MMP. The idea that you can say “this member represents my area the best, but I support this other party’s stances more” is pretty powerful.
87. Qld does not have a senate...there will be no obstruction to whatever they do.
88. [deleted]
89. I agree with four-year terms… but not for an unbridled legislature.
90. Hopefully they're all conscious when they're voting, but who knows.
91. The Labor vote in 2018 was a *conscience* vote tho. And all but three LNP voters voted to keep abortion illegal. And only two of those are still in parliament, last i checked. If you re-ran that today as a conscience vote with a LNP majority, logic says that abortion would be made criminal again.
92. 100%. This isn't some uprising by local mum and dads. It's a targeted approach which is heavily funded. But that heavy funding has meant people like Scomo have been given permission to be vocally anti abortion. It's like when One Nation started and all the racists came out.
93. If only they cared enough about the child once it was born... or the mother.
94. Their are LNP members telling their voters they plan to change the abortion laws. They aren't even being subtle about it The only reason KAP is involved is because they said they would put the bill to parliament. Honestly, we owe them a thanks because judging by the LNPs' reaction, they were already planning on doing it. We just have prior warning now
95. They do have a politics module in schools
96. We already teach nutrition, healthy sleep hygiene, respectful relationships - both within friendship groups and romantic partners, how to write a resume, driver's test preparation, how to conduct yourself at job interviews, how to plan and organise community events, create and market a product for sale, offer first aid courses, food studies, legal studies. Taxation and interest are covered in maths.... what other life skills are you looking for?
97. REMOVE THE EDUCATION FUNDING!!!!!!! ATTACH THE STATE SCHOOL FUNDING!!!!
98. Debt =/= deficit. You can make money and still be in debt. Think about having a job and a mortgage at the same time.
99. I think you’re confusing surplus/deficit with debt.
100. Net debt was forecast to be 12.223 Billion dollars at the end of the 23-24 financial year. Then Miles came out and said they’d spent an extra 9 billion dollars by accident. So who knows what it really is. Point being, the state is already in debt.
101. The surplus was from borrowings. Below is from your link, look at the bottom and second bottom lines. Labor was playing us for mugs saying there was a real surplus. Its a bit like borrowing money to get a fancy car, not making any payments, and having some left at the end of the year. Then giving yourself a pat on the back for it. https://preview.redd.it/3wnx4g2wy8xd1.jpeg?width=1458&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78db8a371e013142670894ea01fe2780a6a66fac
102. It’s possible for a government to have a surplus and also be in debt.
103. The temporarily embarrassed millionaire class. Class consciousness is hard for some because they have to confront the reality they’re closer to being homeless than Elon musk
104. But yet QLD had to vote out the party who actually tried to do something about it? The party who put in policies that benefited a lot of people, including those struggling the most? Assistance with transport, bills and food are HUGE steps into reducing the cost of living pressure. With these gone, more of the population will feel the pinch. Like yes they can't solve the entire issue, but when has an LNP gov in Federal or State power done ANYTHING to help the overall population?
105. The thing is, certain tampering by the state government actually did contribute to a reduction in baseline inflation figures. Namely, energy bill relief and reduction in rego and transport prices. I’m not suggesting that as a result of the LNP probably gutting all of the above that the RBA is going to gleefully hike rates - but it’s not impossible.
106. 50c public transport, Energy rebates, and discounted Registration certainly help.
107. IDK, they were certainly doing something. The rebates can mean an awful lot to a struggling household. And housing is pretty significantly controlled by the state. I don't think it's fair to just put it all down to interest rates and federal stuff.
108. Indeed. Telling people their personal experience didn't happen means that person will not vote for you. You obviously will not help them with their problem because you told them it's not real or called them names. Welcome to opposition Life. It ends when you stop insulting potential supporters
109. There is a big problem I have with that though: LNP’s whole campaign is “Adult Crime, Adult Time”. Alright, please define “Adult” in both those places. While I heard an LNP volunteer try to do so at a polling place, and good on him for trying to do that, the issue is that at the policy platform level, it’s a questionmark. Well, really, that’s the entire LNP policy platform. I don’t like the LNP. I put them last. But I would be a lot more comfortable (though I recognise others wouldn’t be) if they were just honest and transparent. This campaign, my feeling is they have not been. The whole pitch was “we’re not Labor” - precisely so these slogans can be interpreted however the reader wants, regardless of reality. You’ve also talked about “victims of crime”. You do realise how nebulous that is, right? And how even you did not say “victims of _youth_ crime?”
110. Well I can't imagine crime getting any better if the LNP repeat history and sack thousands of public servants including police. No policies to address the root issues, and planned decisions to scrap services that would have a direct and long lasting reduction on crime. What a shame. I hope QLD voters who voted the LNP enjoy higher crime rates, higher taxes, less public services, longer waits in hospitals, paying for ambulances and more cars on the road (last one also comes with increased demand and cost for fuel too!)
