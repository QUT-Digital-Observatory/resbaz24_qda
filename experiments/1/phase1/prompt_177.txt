Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Ha! Watch lnp not spend in rural areas because they've got an Olympics to deliver
2. Fair comment I suppose. Whether I agree with the result or not is irrelevant. People outside the cities are feeling left out and have voted for a change of government accordingly. It's just disappointing that some of the more progressive policies will be shelved but in a lot of rural areas no one gives a shit about 50 cent fares when there's no public transport and you feel you need to lock your house now.
3. Yeah, I used ADHD and ASD as mine. Worked well. Good luck!
4. None of the articles say hot lunches. It just says lunches. Can you link me to the policy that specifically says hot lunches? I worked in a tuckshop in the 00s. We easily provided 200+ exclusively hot meals a day for a school of 800 with only 3 people and were open 5 days a week. We also took lunchtime orders, at the same time - Hot food could only be pre-ordered via paper bag order. Now most tuckshops just take pre-orders that have to be in before the first bell. They also don't solely rely on volunteers any more. Children being fed is important infrastructure. I can deal with a kid being slightly less educated in math than underfed and suffering across the board. Obviously you can't and prioritise differently, that's fine. Edit: The QLD government already provides food support programs for school. My nieces school applied for it and they were able to source free food provided by the local Woolworths to give free fruit to the kids. Yay!
5. By propping up non-issues as justification for being against it... that's where I get it from. Your problems have easy solutions, but instead you're just sitting there having a tanty saying "We've tried nothing and we're all out of options!" Rural schools are NOT the majority. Not to be harsh, but they are not the priority. Feeding 90% of kids is better than feeding none because we can't cater to the few. Extra funding can be provided on a needs basis for those *niche* issues, that is extremely common and *normal* for legislation like this. Kelvin Grove only has 967 primary school students. Not sure where you got the 1,500 from. It also appears they have a fantastic tuckshop system to cater to those large amount of students! Wow, who would've thought! Edit: Did you know they have a junior school tuckshop and a senior school tuckshop? Crazy two tuckshops. Mind blowing. They also *pay* people to work there already - Above award rates too! Looks like they've solved your problems themselves before free lunches were even a thing! I've actually volunteered at a school tuckshop. It took us about 20-30 minutes to cook (As in hot food) about 200 meals... because it's not done with a tiny easy bake oven - So even the most basic tuckshop oven will easily cater to those regional schools that average 200 students. Easily funded and installed! To be fair, that was also the average orders we got and we usually had plenty of free time to just sit around and most shelves in the ovens weren't used. There were only ever 3 or less people doing this. You put the hot food in, you set the timer. Done. You take it out. Put the next lot in. Done. Another 30 minutes. Most likely the free food will not be hot food either. Especially since the 'healthy eating' options became a thing in the late 00s. Another edit: Tuckshop orders are also streamlined now. For my niblings, I just use Qkr! and place the order through there and it's ready for them at lunch. Though they can also put an order in before first bell. No orders happen during the lunch break any more. These things get worked out *after* they're proposed. Welcome to the political process, always good to see new faces.
6. That's my MIL, she tells us all the time she doesn't understand how we live in our suburb cause of all the break ins, youth crime and robberies happening (hint it's not happening) yet looking at stats online she lives in the most crime ridden suburb on the GC which is on the southern end. The propaganda is strong here unfortunately.
7. Sounds like you'd like to start a cult and be the thought police? Will you chant "INGSOC" together? It's funny how the people who claim to be more "progressive" are the first ones to come up with these kinds of statements or talk about how much they despise other people.
8. Oh so it's ok to trespass then because the door wasn't shit correctly? Is that your argument?
9. Look at the state election map, blue except for the red Brisbane city cesspool. Why would they shoot themselves in the foot by neglecting their own seats in favour for labor electorates? Rural hold parties to account as we have just witnessed, I think LNP will be a bit smarter than labor.
10. Again, who says I’m against providing school lunches? pointing out that the proposed policy was poorly thought out, didn’t take into account the realities of many schools in QLD, and was not staffed adequately nor was infrastructure thought about in the timelines is legitimate criticism. Are we not allowed to criticise the problematic parts of good ideas?
11. Yeah, they tried HARD in Gaven, and failed luckily.
12. Honestly, just because it's not happening on your street or to you doesn't mean its not happening at all. What are the actual figures? Do you have a big dog? That could be a deterrent. You clearly hate your neighbours so you probably don't talk to them about whether they've had any issues. Drive around late at night afew nights just randomly. Might change your perception. Ignorance is bliss.
13. No I’m saying it’s not breaking in if the doors open it’s trespassing and if you leave your door open that’s plain stupidity. Also comparing stealing to rape is outrageous
14. Because they are cutting mining royalties, so less money to go around, and they still have an Olympics to deliver. And if you looked at the LNPbudget (as vague as it was) they were already spending less in regional areas. Maybe we'll get a kiddy prison for all the under aged criminals .. that'll be good for the economy
15. Because again... you misunderstanding the political process doesn't mean it's poorly thought out. 😂🤣 They've proposed a school lunch initiative. That will then go to legislative process. Which will then be debated and changed in parliament to consider all these things. That. Is. How. Government. Works. It doesn't happen at the start. They don't submit fully organised proposals! It's a process where ALL of this is sorted out. Bloody hell, talk about wanting instant gratification. What is this timeline you're talking about? They made a proposal! There wasn't even legislation yet, which wouldn't have happened until the New Year. Wait... do you think legislation proposals are instant? Like a government proposes something and it's done instantly? It has to go through the political process before it even starts being implemented. It wouldn't even begin for probably a year after that so schools can be upgraded. Have you been thinking this whole time that even when legislation is passed that it begins... immediately? 😐
16. Saw that in the results! All other areas of the GC were blue and they were red. Go on Gaven
17. Looking at actual figures..... Didn't I just say looking at the statistics online..... Because of one comment you assume I hate my neighbours, might have a dog, don't drive around or at night etc etc? Southern GC resident getting pissy as per usual, you know cause we're assuming now. Such big brain over here, ignorance is definitely bliss in your world ✌🏽
18. His press releases and announcements said start of Term 1 2025. His own announcements. That’s the timeline I’m talking about. So by your own admission, he was lying to the electorate, since his promise couldn’t be achieved.
19. >Yup unfortunately my area now. Live in a suburb that was full of young families, young couples and single people years ago and is now overrun with boomers, who vote LNP (and was proven in the results) I hate it here Uhhh??? ^ that's one of your comments. It kinda of implies you hate your neighbours.
20. Also what I meant by actual figure vs stats is, for example, 1 in 10 properties are broken into in this whole suburb. Therefore, this is a high crime area or a red zone. They may say crime has risen by 50% or something like that. However, that data doesn't account for one street being much higher crime than the rest due to things like an abundance of low income housing or high density housing or access to a main road. It doesn't always specify between residential and business break ins either. You can usually get that more specific information from your local neighbourhood watch group if you're interested (if you have one).
21. So here as in the area cause if price gouging on houses and other things, influx of traffic, means I hate my neighbours ..... Ok buddy 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 I hate my neighbours specifically 🙄🙄. That's what you wanna take away from my comment, instead of the influx of propaganda that is getting into people's lives especially the older generation/boomers, you do that
22. My dad and step fil are both ex high up-police, I can get actual statistics and can research it just fine thank you. Stop making assumptions on people from one comment when you don't know shit
23. Yeah you never said anything about any of those other things...You want me to read your mind? I don't have super powers. There has always/will always be propaganda from all sides. It's what politicians do. Boomers aren't falling any harder for the politicians than the young who think they know better but don't necessarily have the wisdom/intelligence they think they have. Youth is arrogant.
24. So you have family in the police force but crime isn't a problem???? Wow. And now I think I've heard it all. Yeah. Goodnight.
25. The real power is with people and that’s what people have decided. If anything Labor & Green want to learn, they must learn why it went south on them and maybe come back with something better for the next time but in the end we must remember it’s the people who have chosen and I just hope they attain what they chose the present government for.
26. [removed]
27. Thank god they’re so incompetent it’ll be easy fixing in 28 for the return
28. You’re in a better position than most other states. I can’t believe it took this long to be honest
29. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😥😢😥😫😫💤💤💤💤
30. Labour got what they deserved. Will the liberal be any better? Yeah, we'll see in 4 years.
31. Ahh Reddit, the whinging post for disappointed lefties…..
32. Damn looks like buying a abandoned house in Japan is happening sooner then I thought won’t be able to afford rent now come next week
33. I'll need to learn Russian because Crisafulli would sell our state to the Russian interests sooner or later. It'll come handy.
34. I’m a Laborite all the way, but even I’m getting the popcorn out.
35. keep em coming.
36. This, I hate the result, I live in NQ, but this is democracy. We are the only state that has more population living outside the capital then within it, the regions hold power and they are swing seats now. Towns turned Blue that didn't even go in the Newman landslide, this is a very big lesson that ALP should take a lot of notes on.
37. This is an all too reasonable reply which doesn’t fit here. The campaigning on these pages has been an embarrassment with foot soldiers making any discussion impossible. Hoping things get a bit more reasonable. No matter the colour of the party, a decade is long enough. Unfortunately scare campaigns are now the standard - so much so that people believe them because they are repeated enough
38. 100% correct answer. The people here complaining about the end of the world don’t seem to realise there were a bunch of people who felt the same way last time Labor won. Both groups are guilty of catastrophising.
39. That's a disgusting way to think
40. 🫡
41. Yes but can we all survive that long? And if we manage to, how long will it take to recover?
42. Pretty much. Once Dave's on TV and we'll known, he will be hated a lot more. There's a lot of reasons why they played a small campaign.
43. Inevitable. But, alas. Not as bad a loss as expected a month ago, and people will hate Dave I reckon pretty darn quickly.
44. Curious, deserved? Why? Honestly, we had a government that did a steady run of policies to tackle the cost of living crisis in a manner that didnt drive up inflation (cutting costs of things like energy, transport, rego, could have been free school lunchs that would pull a ton of kids out of poverty and allow them to be far more productive citizens as they grow up, etc) rather than just throwing money as a stimulus, and seemed to make all the right moves other than not owning a media monopoly and liquifying any suspicious looking youths on sight. It was expected they would lose, but not really a good reason for them other than vibes.
45. Not even a leftie, voted LNP my whole life until Campbell Newman fucked the state. Labor are the most centrist and balanced party. Greens voters are what I would consider “lefties”
46. the explosion of the housing market happened entirely under the labor government...
47. It's all entertaining watching people cope about things they care about. But the knowledge that people will unnecessarily suffer, die, and we will atrophy as a state and not have nice things, is a bitter pill to swallow. Politics matters and there's a lot of reasons people care about it. Which includes general empathy for others, and understanding what you get from a decent government. Personally making/saving an extra 3 to 4 this year because of ALP policies, massive reduction to public transport costs, not paying power for months, tax cuts, and pay raises to help catch up with inflation. Not to mention a job that almost tripled my income because of their policies. (And put me in an amazing workplace, and able to be a lot more social now). Compared to the LNP, when we almost lost everything as a family because of their cuts.
48. I really hope they do learn from this. There were just swings everywhere. It was really not the question of who of the two was better really but ALP campaigning wasn’t any better. If anything they sounded more fear mongers than their counter parts. At least they stopped bringing Russell’s story as campaign material. I wasn’t seeing in my YouTube ad from last couple of weeks or so. It was that crying woman which tbh wasn’t an easy on ears as well but yeah at least it wasn’t as uncomfortable and the person was still alive. My heart breaks every time I’m thinking of the man and what happened to his son and his family. Anyway, not seeing much getting changed but at least a reminder the world is for people and people living in it. If you cannot calm a common person’s concerns, someone who sells better would do that. Whether they do anything effective or not, it’s a separate debate and only time can tell.
49. Yeah I was really embarrassed and quite annoyed at the scare campaign ads from both sides. Far out every new YouTube video can’t be started without the ads. I’m glad the ads would be gone at least now.
50. Yeah it won’t be ideal, I bet Coles and Woolies will lower prices now making people think lnp is doing it, just so they get more tax cuts and remain a duopoly
51. They failed to properly communicate exactly how they were going to deal with many tough issues and after Palascuk flatly abandoned them, Miles' bribery campaign is too little and too late. People must be asking why now? They see a fractured, stale and indecisive party and the conservatives flatly exploited that. It's too little too late for them. As someone that's firmly planted far left, they've done nothing but piss me off. As for youth crime, the system is in much worse shape than we are led to believe publicly (not just talking about crime). None of them, including federally, are doing what's necessary on that front. And now over the next 4 years we can enjoy the fostering of a generation of career criminals and more serious crime in the years to come. Labour deserved to lose because they have failed real progressives and now everyone will be reminded of what that looks like. Federal labour is no better right now either. We live in tough times, incrementalism is not what people want to see. They want wholesale approaches. People think they are going to get that changing parties. Good luck with that.
52. Shhhhhh none of that logic around here!!
53. I’m more getting at that it doesn’t matter who is in charge none of them will do a thing to benefit anyone but themselves
54. Which was massively set in motion by policy's pushed under Howard. And repeatedly hindered by cuts to things like Taff, which broke the pipeline of tradies that would reduce costs of construction and address a limiting factor in all state construction. We need people who can build shit. Government actions can take decades to really take effect, but its snowballed since then. Just like a lot of issues in the western world stems from the 80s when we fucked up our tax systems for rich people.
55. Bro, that's the dumbest take I've seen today. How does state LNP affect national tax? Why would Colesworths even bother lowering prices when they could just their buddies in the media to just skew the stats to suit the LNP?
56. It’ll effect public perception giving the news bs to report while they ignore the inadequacies of the lnp
57. Fooled me once, shame on you.... Fooled me twice....? Let's see what happens now. Are we going to see a Newman 2.0?
58. Well a fair amount of us in the health industry that aren't full time and contracted should be really worried right about now. The irony of all of the country people who contribute SFA tax wise,who are flown down at astronomical cost through RFDS etc fucking us is not lost on me
59. Fuck me dead. We are in for an absolute treat with this one.
60. I don’t know how anyone looks at the LNP and thinks, that’s the party that represents me and my values. The only thing I can think of is “ I have what’s mine and I don’t care” it’s apathy as long as it doesn’t affect me.
61. I'm just thankful that I was able to have an abortion 20 years ago. I fear for the women of today.
62. So another public service sector culling ? Followed by contract employment of government jobs by crappy recruitment agencies.
63. This election has actually enraged me I have never been this pissed off before about an election like this Queensland just let a slimy short greasy Italian version of Newman into power say good bye to the surplus we are in and the current plans for greener Queensland you may as well just send him your money now
64. honestly devastating as im going into uni for nursing and paramedicine after school next year
65. Given that entities with connections to Russian state apparatus have donated to Crisafulli's campaign, one with Putin instead of Newman is also applicable.
66. At least we know that Queenslanders will kick them out on their arse if they do it again.
67. I want my $1000 electricity royalty cash taken from the boomer aged pension to pay me seeing they wanted the coal companies to have it instead
68. Well the next four years are going to be tough. Just hope they get the venue for the Olympics right. Because the current plan of using Ballsac stadium will be an international embarrassment. Sure, give ball sac a coat of paint and a minor uplift, it’ll be a good venue for training before the event, but as the home of the athletics, it’s a terrible option.
69. This is why we can't have nice things
70. Hope so
71. I’m from Sydney. I can’t for the life of me, understand why Queensland voted this piece of shit in. Hopefully he sends a message to the rest of Australia, reminding them of the reasons not to vote for the LNP in the federal election.
72. Lol the insanity in these posts today. No wonder you lose elections if this is the mentality of the voter base
73. Crisafooli me once shame on you, Chrisafooli me twice shame on me.
74. If the LNP does make awful decisions would it be possible for the federal government to possibly force us into another election?
75. How is Reddit so jammed with Left wing loonies. The sweetest victory is seeing the greens get 0 seats and all the tears on reddit. Just amazing
76. Queensland morons strike again
77. You are mixing two shows together just like the Meme
78. As someone who supports labor, im surprised how we behave like Liberals when we lose. Accept defeat gracefully and focus on being a good opposition. Don’t let your personal beliefs, egos and opinions get in the way. Grow up.
79. How's your basement tonight? Salty?
80. Fuk Labor!!! 😂😂
81. Really see that labor voters taking the democratic election loss well.
82. I can only get so erect. Don't tease me
83. Give him a chance. Most of you were in primary school when Newman was in. Stop following reddit and your your own brains
84. ALP shocked that repeating “Campbell Newman” like a stunned parrot for months didn’t distract from their miserable term in government.
85. I wish
86. Its all one One big scam anyhow. Fake jobs all of them. Unlucky if u work for state , grab that lawnmower and start mowing lawns.
87. The only thing I can be thankful for is not working in the public sector but this is definitely horrendous news.
88. They see Brisbanites having affordable public transport and think they deserve a six lane highway to their front door in bumfucknowhere
89. Preach, colleague. I work in a large Brisbane public hospital and this describes so many of the regional and rural patients (and their visiting families) that I meet on the wards. Really lovely people on a personal basis 90% of the time, charming to interact with, usually full of impressed praise at the level, quality and compassion of care they receive and awed at the medical resources that get deployed on their behalf - and so often with a bone deep hostility to Labor and a baffling paradoxical commitment to bringing in an LNP government that would at best severely neglect, and at worst badly gut, the very system that's helping them. So goddamn frustrating.
90. That is a perfectly valid point I had completely missed.
91. From working in polling, LNP voters are mostly old people who shout racist abuse to Asian polling staff, and immigrants who barely speak English who take their political advice from ACA.
92. That’s exactly what it is. People like my father who claim “I’m retired so I get free fares so 50c fares don’t affect me” $1000 energy rebate? He couldn’t even tell you his last 20 energy bills. They just get direct debited as he has more than enough money in retirement it doesn’t concern him. Same with the rego discount. “Free school lunches? Why would I vote for that that doesn’t affect me?”. He’s built a life for himself and been successful in the military and property investment and now he’s retired with more than enough money to last generations. None of the policies affect him. So he doesn’t care and just votes for who he’s always voted for. LNP
93. Compared to the disaster that was ALP? Easy choice.
94. Or someone who served his country and now works on our family farm near Roma. The liberal party can get in the bin, but the nationals have always represented me and my values. It's easy to just throw hate, but you have no idea the absolute havoc this shit labor government has caused for myself and my family out here. You talk about apathy? How about some for us out west.
95. If only Amanda Stoker's mother did the same.
96. Contract employment through crappy recruitment agencies has been happening for years now. Nothing new
97. Punctuation? Come out west and see the shit that labor had caused. The bullshit beaucracy has caused havoc on our farm and many just like it. Fucking loved seeing Miles put on his ass tonight.
98. Fuck off city slickers of Brisbane. All might be nice and well in Brisbane but up North it’s a shit show. Let’s go LNP
99. And in 4 years, you might graduate under a different government. Don't let it get you down. Your career will withstand many changes in government.
100. As someone about to graduate from paramed stuck to nursing way easier to find work way more grads then jobs for paramedics and I don't expect QAS to be having massive hiring sprees soon
101. You’ll be fine. You don’t have to stay in QLD. You’ll be able to live and work anywhere.
102. You do the national registration after you finish paramedicine and can work in any state
103. Don’t postpone your life due to reddit Chicken Littles. The world will still be turning after your degree and you’ll be in a much better spot.
