Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. When was the last time you were homeless? What specific difficulties in your life made you vulnerable to homelessness? Do you have any idea what it's like?
2. That isn't the problem the guy i'm replying to is worried about.
3. I’ve written about providing different tiers of housing for homeless people. 1. Provide safe, secure campsites with ammenities, similar to commercial camping grounds. 2. Provide more secure temporary accommodation similar to the ones provided to FIFO workers at camp sites. 3.Provide low-cost permanent social housing in already established areas, close to public transport and support services. In my enquires I’ve been informed that there a factory in CQ turning out prefab houses. I don’t know what the numbers are or if it’s just a trial. We need to do more. We can do more. We can do better.
4. And you're going to use the actions of the most desperate to justify cruelty without a transitional support plan? I think thats way out of line by schrinner and anybody who supports his actions here.
5. I'm not saying its up to BCC to fix the nation's housing issues, I'm referring to infrastructure and programs to support the Brisbane homeless population specifically, things the BCC already do, but clearly have a need for more of Tbf I live near Musgrave park and don't want the homeless community there either, but I'm not in the position to do something about it. I feel that simply shutting off the power and leaving them high and dry just makes things worse. If it's the same for the other parks then what's to stop them from trying to hijack power from a random business/ home
6. Housing is the responsibility of all levels of government as all levels contribute to the problem. You write about social contract. Well the council is at the coalface of the community-government point of contact. They receive funds from the State Government and they are able to raise funds directly via rates and fees. They in the ideal position to help the homeless. The fact they don’t, either unilaterally or in cooperation with the other tiers of government is a sad indictment of our communities. By. The way, councils do contribute to the problem. They choose to charge higher rates for rental properties., thus contributing to cost increase pressures on landlords. State Governments do the same thing by charging ever-increasing Land Tax and Stamp duties.
7. Cool story. I replied to basically the same thing here: https://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/1garr1b/comment/ltgaqqf/ Still yet to hear from anybody in this post about how disconnecting power and stopping them from cooking food helps anybody. Parks and zoning is absolutely in the local councils wheelhouse. They do have some responsibility here, there’s no easy solution… but being cruel isn’t it.
8. Not a fucking shred of empathy. Could have been a myriad of other solutions - here's one that doesn't involve removing an essential from a group of people already well under the bottom line and trying to survive: the BCC Critical Response Teams working with local community groups to provide these people with outdoor-rated extension leads and power boards (which are cents and pennies to BCC). But nah, let's just go straight for the artery and remove another thing that these people so desperately need in a first world country. Really, really, really bad take man. I hope you never have to experience what extended homelessness is like.
9. [removed]
10. All good, I was busy [glorying homeless people](https://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/1garr1b/comment/ltgsmqr/) as you say 🙄
11. Social housing is a Government responsibility !! Therefore instead of blaming the LNP, go shove it to the ALP or does that not suit your viewpoint
12. Do you ?
13. I follow a person who does a lot to help the homeless of Brisbane and get them into this sort of shelter. He says that a lot of the people are musgrave have been offered hotel rooms etc but don’t want to abide by the rules so they go back there.
14. Why should Council reward bad behaviour
15. > Still yet to hear from anybody in this post about how disconnecting power and stopping them from cooking food helps anybody They disconnected the power as they were overloading the power in the bbq and causing fires, did you even read the article? "The council said a secure door underneath the barbecue had been broken into and people were using the power outlets inside to charge their phones and other devices. A council spokesperson said two recent fires in Musgrave Park had been caused by the outlets being overloaded, sparking safety concerns."
16. Council has defined powers and responsibilities, you don’t get to pick where your individual rates go. You get to vote & then the council gets to spend those rates within the bounds of their duties and the local government act.
17. Comment respectfully. Continued harassment may result in you being banned.
18. And attacking me personally somehow makes you better?
19. Uh... Council. The ALP isn't local government right now. However as the state government they ARE building social housing. It just took them forcing it through and overriding local government restrictions.
20. Yes, and the council is the local arm of the government which has presided over this power cut. Social housing is on them as much as atate and federal or did you just suddenly forget that the council is capable or doing something?
21. I understand that. In some cases people find themselves in that situation because of mental health issues and living in a hotel environment is probably not what they want or need. It can be very isolating and daunting with the rules of daily living.
22. Well, its clear either you were not born with the ability for perspective, compassion or empathy, regardless of what you keep telling yourself.
23. Yep. Cutting it off isn’t the solution. Recreational campsites can have outdoor outlets, done right they should have overload protection. Cutting them off means they can’t charge phones. Arranging appointments, getting support, contacting family and friends, job interviews, Centrelink support… all gets *really difficult* without a phone these days. This solution is lazy and cruel. I’m still yet to hear how cutting it off completely helps anybody.
24. No shit. I want homeless people supported, not inhumanly treated.
25. Not exactly true. Council has the ability to include ‘funding homelessness programmes’ if they so choose, in the same way they assist with street fairs and other entertainment activities. To keep the parks clean they could provide more bins emptied daily. They could provide portable toilets, portable showers, more power outlets, daily cleaning services. More can be done. It just requires coordination between different departments within council and State government.
26. [removed]
27. Local government does not and has never provided social housing. It's 100% a state government responsibility.
28. Not forgetting at all, just pointing out that your thinking is politically skewed is all. Maybe you should push another agenda
29. oh well, if that's the best retort you can come up with ........ enjoy your weekend. Maybe you can go visit the Campers and have a discussion with some of them like I have. I can assure you, your eyes will be opened by the hardship, sad tales and the absolute gall of some who feel they deserve to get everything and give nothing in return.
30. It is the correct safety solution from a legislative duty of care position. Otherwise someone will get hurt. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
31. And voter and rate payer support. Representative democracy. One of the primary drivers behind having a LNP dominated council is that ratepayers want council money spent in their divisions, on themselves, not collecting their money and spending it on things like this, for non ratepayers. Most of the people in Musgrave have been offered shelter and short term accom at this point, but cannot stay because of drug and violence issues. Infinite chances does not scale with large populations. realistically many of them are now going to eventually end up in forced drug detox programs via prison. There are a few greens divisions that are more open to more of this type of spending, but if you’re the councillor for paddington, you still have to deal with the reality that you have two seats in council, nowhere near a majority, control none of the council chairs & while their division are supportive in theory, in reality they are still NIMBYs. Musgrave park is in Trina Massey’s division, who is a greens councillor. Trina is on the parks committee. Trina has plenty of recent pro Palestine posts, yet nothing about musgrave park. Because voters don’t want it. The hard left will continue to chant “we must do more, we must do more” for the rest of eternity, but realistically there are support services available, these are people intentionally choosing to live on the fringe.
32. Comment respectfully. Continued harassment may result in you being banned.
33. Haha yeah now I see why you can’t look up sources. You’re one of the people that says to do your own research and then types “why are the left so mean to me” in chatGPT.
34. It seems like you're dismissing my perspective by labeling it as politically skewed without addressing the actual points I’ve made. I’m open to hearing your reasoning, but it would be more constructive if we discuss the specifics instead of assuming agendas or biases.
35. [removed]
36. It’s the easy/cheap solution. God forbid we aim above the bare fucking minimum for other humans.
37. Whether they are forced to live on the fringe or whether they choose their needs are the same; safe, secure accommodation with appropriate in place.probably more support for those choosing to live on the fringe.
38. Projecting isnt going to fix your lack of evidence dumbass.
39. Oh, now you have turned nasty, like a kindergarten kid that does not get their own way !!! Hahahha !!! and no, I don't believe you have spoken with them at all.
40. How do you provide safe, secure accommodation to people who make the accomodation unsafe due to their own mental health, drug and alcohol issues? You can’t cure these issues overnight. Many are probably generational trauma related and realistically are something that can be hopefully managed, not cured. You can’t just ignore it, then they infringe on the safety and peace for the other guests and employees of the shelters and hotels. Becomes an uninsurable nightmare. It’s also a great way to cause a UK style generational welfare trap, where you have 20%+ of London now council housing, that rapidly become slums & you punish people for trying or they will lose their council house. Jailing them seems like a terrible idea. Might detox from the drugs but creates new trauma. So what do you do? Let’s say I’m an active amphetamine user with a history of getting kicked out of shelters for stealing and violent outbursts. Where are you going to house me? I also refuse to not continue to use amphetamines, you can make it a condition that I can’t use them, but I have a long term addiction. I’m going to ride that glass Harley again, soon.
41. Well, continue your deflective rhetoric, I know you for the lazy slob you are. You won't change, you won't actually meet any of my points with anything cause you know, you have always had nothing. Sad. But true.
42. I’ve written and voiced my idea to provide safe and secure camping areas for those who want/ need that type of accommodation. For those who are able to live within a more formal setting, accommodation similar to the type provided at mining and other work camps would fit the bill ; that is Dongas that are fully self-contained or have shared laundry/toilet and kitchen facilities, or anything in between. The important thing is for the people to have their own safe sleeping and private space. The aim is to house the homeless until social housing numbers are sufficient to meet the needs of the community. However it needs to be a nationwide project otherwise people will just relocate to the state/s which provide the service.
43. I really don't understand your rambling ...... and continuing with nasty comments does nothing to promote anything you have to say. Lazy slob !! I have nothing !! what foolish words as you do not know me !! Best you go and have a nice night !
44. Ok so I come into your camp. Day one, I smoke up, smash my room to pieces and threaten to murder the guy next door while he sleeps for shouting at to shut up when I’m screaming my drug induced psychosis rant at 3am. It’s now 8am, you’ve turned up to work for the day. I’m only on day 2 of a binge, so I’m still in full fight mode. What happens now?
45. So, deflective. To the end. You had nothing. Wow. I knew it. It wouldn't matter if I did or didn't get emotional with the way you've been talking. Personal experiences do suck sometimes, such as being homeless. And for your information, I have been homeless before. I climbed the fuck out. But I know just how hard it can be, so don't service me with your empty platitudes "Uncle2Bart". Seriously, I can't stand your rhetoric. You're absolutely cunning about it too. I fucking hate dismissive douchebags like you.
46. What would have happened if what you’ve just outlined happened in a block of units or a regular suburban street or a hotel? I’m guessing someone would have called the police. The person would have been arrested and either taken to the watch house or to ED. Anyway what’s that got to do with providing safe accommodation for homeless people?
47. Because we have safe housing and the government and charities are fairly good at getting people into it. What they are not good at, is housing people with drug and mental health issues. We used to lock them up in asylums. Which was also a fairly terrible solution. Now they bounce between prison and Musgrave park until they do something to warrant long term incarceration. So roleplay it out. I get take to emergency. They will bounce me. Now do I go back to the shelter where I just threatened to murder someone and smashed up the place? You’re living in a fantasy land where this is an easily solvable problem, “just give them a bed to sleep in”. When it’s nowhere near that simple. The housing status is almost always a symptom of a much more complex issue to solve. Which is the same reason why they can’t stay with friends, family, etc. because guess what… when you’re a violent drug addict, people tend to not want you in their homes and you burn through all your relationships fast.
48. I agree with much of what you’ve written, I don’t live in a fantasy world. Far from it. You sound like someone who has either worked or known people with serious mental health issues. I’ve had / have close family members like that. One ended up living with my mother (another country). They made life hell for her last 20 years. Others caused marriage and family breakdowns. I’ve worked with people with serious mental health issues and understand the complexities. However NOT all homeless people fall into that category. Some are homeless for reasons other than their mental health, though long-term homelessness is a big factor in developing serious mental health issue’s. Yes the government and charities do have access to safe housing, but there’s enough to go around. It’s not just the obvious homeless in parks and under bridges, there’s the invisible ones couch surfing, living in cars or staying in emergency accommodation. Now that there’s a new state government that’s looking at making monetary savings I hope things don’t go backwards. The LNP are not known for their social justice programs. Just because the solution is hard it doesn’t mean that we stop trying.
49. Absolutely. And PSA: if you go to hospital we have a triage system which isn't a first come first serve situation. If you urgently need help, you'll get it.
50. If this is a government IT project it won’t even be done before the next election.
51. I mean, I actually think there are multiple solutions to emergency department wait times that would take strain off the emergency system overall in non life threatening situations. Non emergency 24/7 clinics, school district nurses, company based medical officers in large scale operations etc.
52. I have spent many years working in Emergency Departments and the ramping issue is many layered and complex. The first issue is that ED is a funnel , building bigger EDs' does not fix the problem, its like making the mouth of the funnel wider whilst the spout remains the same size. What is actually needed is more medical / surgical beds in the wards, better post discharge services such as Hospital in the Home. Additionally, more aged care beds are required as patients awaiting aged care placement take up acute beds while waiting for a position to become available in the age care system. Colocating bulk billing 16 hour GP services within a reasonable proximity of EDs' would allow for non urgent cases to be moved through a GP clinic and free up ED beds for those people needing the higher level of care. Many approaches have been tried over the years and have not been successful as they potentially could have been due to Q Health and the Government of the day ( both parties) not providing ongoing funding or not providing adequate staff and dooming the projects to failure. For example an ED opened in Qld . The new department was twice the size of the old department however it was not funded for additional staff and ran with the same number of staff as had previously been in the old department. Consequently, although the public saw a new massive department and had an expectation that the waiting times would be less. In reality it was just a shiny new box with the same old insides. A large number of cases also come in from aged care for routine issues that should of been handled at an aged care facility but as many aged care facilities only employ a single registered nurse , often very junior and inexperienced they have inadequate resources to deal with patients who may been easily managed had the facility had more adequate resources. Apart form filling an ED bed with a patient who needed relatively minor interventions but must occupy a bed either through comorbidities or because of altered mental states (dementia etc) they usually require QAS transport to and from the nursing home thus removing an ambulance form the available pool to respond to the wider general public. Capital investment in infrastructure needs to be sped up to meet the increasing demand for services, for example the new Bundaberg Hospital will open in 2027 providing it opens on schedule but is likely to be over time and over budget . The planning and contract negotiations for this hospital started in 2017/ 2018 so from initial design to opening will be around a decade and if it comes in on budget about 1.2 billion dollars I understand that people want world class medical care and they should have it but there is a limit as to what can be provided with current budgets. So many people complain when they are asked to contribute more to support the system and it is understandable that with spiraling cost it is a difficult ask but without adequate budgets and capital works investment the public healthcare sector will continue to fail.
53. Satellite hospitals are a great thing to have around. My mother had to take my sister into the one at Ripley after she'd been off for a few days and only mentioned a head knock to her after a few days worth of symptoms. Took her into the Ripley satellite hospital, in and out within 2 hours, excellent care, and got what she needed from it. Doctor figured it was post concussion syndrome and sent her off with what she needed, plus it saved a bunch of time that wouldn't been wasted waiting in the ED of a bigger hospital.
54. Can't run a hospital like it's a fucking drive through window with nurses and doctors under even more pressure to get wait times down. Not everything needs to be treated like a business.
55. This is a horrific idea. Do they even consult medical professionals for these rogue plans?
56. The LNP don’t “ get “ anything about the public health system. If they thought they could get away with dismantling it they would.
57. I agree. The ED is something you either need or you don't. It's not a wait dependent thing. If it is, go to an urgent care or see a GP or dial a doctor.
58. It's a moronic idea that won't change anything - if my experience from ambulance (including clinical opcen work) is anything to go by, it's still unlikely to influence decisions to go (especially from inappropriate users who literally don't care). It'll just dissuade people who probably need to be there from seeking help. The bandaid is to expand the hospitals - more beds to fix bed block to allow EDs to cycle patients more quickly. We also need to accept that telehealth can only go so far, and sometimes we just need to assess people in-person. That means having capacity to do so. That said - the satellite hospitals need to be reworked. They're *not hospitals* and should never have been called hospitals. They're Minor Injury and Illness Clinics. As a paramedic I find them somewhat frustrating because it's sometimes hard to refer patients here with apparently arbitrary refusals (one day x is fine - the next it isn't). They should be utilised much more and we should have better guidance on what can be *reliably referred*. The actual *fix* though - people need to get used to getting the care they *need* and not necessarily what they *want*. That's a big attitude shift that we're going to have to push, because as much as throwing extra beds helps for a bit, it quickly becomes overwhelmed. There's an entire set of systemic failures at multiple points putting pressure on EDs and wards - and things like nursing homes/CAREPACT and RADAR, GP clinics/bulk billing issues, hospital@home programs, and paramedic referral pathways need to evolve to reduce presentations where possible.
59. The NHS in the UK publishes this information live - E.g. https://aeinfo.nhs.wales/
60. Just a reminder to people on here that QLD health also has a Virtual Emergency Department where you can speak to Emergency Nurses and Doctors for minor (and some more complex issues). They can organize pathology, Xrays, CT's etc and provide followup for all testing. It's a great service with good wait times (and even if you are waiting a bit, wouldn't you rather do it at home?) And if they think you need to be seen in a physical ED they will refer you to one. Advertising wait times in ED'S won't fix any of the problems we have in healthcare atm.
61. This is CLASSIC LNP blaming frontline staff and hospitals for a system that could probably be doubled and still not meet needs of the community This is how they started last time , then they slashed healthcare to absolutely fucking dangerous levels
62. These cunts really do not have any good ideas. This is what I was saying to my husband, the Abortion stance is already bad enough, but we're also not paying enough attention to their other terrible ideas.
63. People already self-triage now. I calculate wait times in my head before deciding to ride it out or wait 8-12 hours to get care. My husband took my daughter to a local for whooping cough symptoms and turned back for home when he saw the wait lines. Infantilising people by hiding numbers isn’t going to change that. And it’s worse trying to see a Dr by appointment.
64. So it's about putting pressure on the existing staff and not expanding the services to meet. I can already hear supposed Health Minister Ros Bates screeching "your simply not hitting your kpi's!". When will people realised that not only do the LNP not care they are such a shallow pool of real world experience they haven't a bloody clue.
65. so what will fix ALP's ambulance ramping disaster?
66. I get how this can turn dangerous, but in fairness, I have called ahead at the ED to ask “is it super busy” - because sometimes it’s worth copping the private ED fee to avoid a wait (and it takes strain off the public one too).
67. I can't say how this would impact, all I know is last time we had an LNP government I was in and out of the ED in less time that I have since had to wait to have my children seen for very similar, sometimes worse things. I've also had a the ED door bitch basically tell me to f\*\*\* off and intimate that I was a drug addict seeking medication for wanting to have a broken bone assessed. And there are other things that I don't really want to share either. But I'm open to anything that changes the way EDs operate, because at the moment they're failing hard (and that is not a reflection of the work of the individuals my child or I have been treated by, once you see someone they're usually very good).
68. Took my son to the ED last night. He stacked it on the scooter. A few cuts and bruises but his arm appeared to be fractured. They took him in immediately. I’ve also been to that same ED and waited 4 hours for a crazy deep cut on my arm that needed stitches… happened at night or I’d have gone elsewhere and I didn’t complain once. This is ridiculous
69. As others have said, this is useless because of the triage system emergency rooms rightly have. Qld Health actually leads the world in the public reporting of hospital information that matters (google inform my care), including for private hospitals. This is at risk if the LNP are elected & bow to their private health donors.
70. More Labor lies
