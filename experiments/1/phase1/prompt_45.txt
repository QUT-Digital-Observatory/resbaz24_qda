Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. abortion was horribly weaponised when no change was on the table. the Labor Law was done on a conscience vote for Labor and Liberal as it should be. Now all of a sudden Labor, with no actual record to run on , used it as a wedge. As for the debate, I cant see any reasonable person could refuse the Babies Born Alive Bill, we are talking clear infanticide. and having Abortion up until birth is one of the most extreme laws in the world. whether it should be illegal is another debate. the best of both sides of the issue are trying to adopt a caring attitude, albeit selectively.
2. Katter went from 4 seats to 1 seat. Surely that tells you all you need to know? + The LNP have NEVER said they would seek to change Abortion or VAD laws. Opposite. They gave clearly stated they are not interested. This issue is a storm in a teacup. Clung onto by the ALP to frighten people. Stop being so silly. What a gullible lot so many if you are
3. The abortion topic was likely just a scare tactic with misinformation from Labor, LNP have said numerous times now that they won’t be touching abortion laws or women’s rights. The only reason they haven’t answered it with a more direct answer is for the obvious reason of not wanting to upset their religious base/affiliates. I would be very surprised if anything changes on the abortion front over these next 4 years. If it does then I would (un)happily eat my words.
4. Largely, protesting is illegal, and also deliberately impossible such that it effects politicians.
5. Crisafaulli has clearly stated that they aren't looking at it.
6. The greens are gone which was just the icing on the cake.
7. I am pretty excited to see what LNP can offer
8. ALP has run the state 30 of the last 35 years. Campbell Newman being the exception. I think there is a general distain for Crisafulli right now due to a range of factors. Have to see what he does in the position before he can be criticised as premier.
9. is reddit a left-wing echo chamber? how come everytime politics is discussed, left-wing always wins. goes to show you folks are the vocal minority haha
10. guys everyone chill, even though i voted for labor i dont care that LNP won. nothings bad going to happen, we are still australia, can we not let politics become divisive like it is in america? ur all over-reacting like typical liberals on reddit. be happy it was resulted fair and square yeah? take a chill pill
11. The fear mongering on this sub has been crazy, really sad to see. Here's hoping Amy MacMahon can still somehow come out in top for south Brisbane and not Labors terrible option.
12. I can’t forgot what Labor did when keeping family members out from seeing dying relatives during COVID and the cruelty around that. Happy we have a fresh start 💙
13. Isn't it as simple as having a [Referendum](https://documents.parliament.qld.gov.au/explore/education/factsheets/factsheet_6.2_referendums.pdf) for stuff like this?
14. Crime is out of control under the LNP now if their stats are correct surely
15. Democracy won, your personal vote lost. That’s how it works in the real world and this experience will better you for when you eventually head out into yourself.
16. [removed]
17. It's a distraction. Stop getting distracted.
18. Knowing many typically conservative voters, I dont know a single person who wants abortion laws changed. It wasn't even on the table.. it was a last ditch effort to try and fear monger voters away from the LNP. So who exactly do you propose protesting to?? I for one am sick and tired of all these irrelevant protests in our city. I'll add this to the list until it actually becomes an issue.
19. Can someone summarise for me, why (except in extreme circumstances e.g rape) stricter abortion laws is very bad? With the use of contraceptives (Condom + birth control etc), isn’t the potential of bearing a child so low?
20. I’m 50 and girls were having abortions without trouble when I was 15. I can’t see that changing.
21. [deleted]
22. Baby killers seeth.
23. I'm sorry but In no world in mass infanticide a good thing. If you think it is you really should take a look at the state of yourself and your community.
24. so here are the countries than ban abortion - commenting on the USA is unfair and demonstrates a certain bias.

25. only time abortion should be legal is for rape cases. Can’t just have 16 year old Susie getting run thru weekly and killing a few babies a year
26. Why are we even talking about abortion in a state where women are murdered daily by their male family members ?
27. [removed]
28. so here are the countries than ban abortion - commenting on the USA is unfair and demonstrates a certain bias. Andorra, Aruba, the Dominican Republic, Laos, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Iraq, Jamaica, Madagascar, Malta, Mauritania, Nicaragua, Palau, Suriname, the Philippines, the Republic of the Congo, San Marino, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Tongo have completely outlawed abortion.

29. Ah, already taking the views of her constituents into consideration 😵‍💫
30. It's gone. I mean, not answering 120+ times and you think "oh you know, it might just all work out in the end". They're gone. They will try to use Katter as a scapegoat but you all know they're all gonna Mario twist spin like a fucking comet down on that "FUCKING SEEYAAAA" button when they're sworn in. Lol I know it isn't directed specifically at you. But I can't believe how much of an "oh, well um.. I guess I hope everything works out after this...." from people I am seeing. Chickens voting for Steggals
31. Keep up the pressure. She's a moderate I'm pretty sure. 3 moderates voted with Labor to decriminalisation abortion and they might be our only shot at keeping it that way. She can't block your emails and phone calls.
32. lmao thats unreal.
33. Write a registered letter. Publish the reply.
34. She did that to me too. There goes the area.
35. Sounds like she really cares about the people she is supposed to be serving. /s Do politicians forget that it is the public that they are supposed to be serving and that's literally the whole point of their job as public servants. I think they need a good reminding of that fact.
36. Also in Aspley and I may just be optimistic but I'm holding out hope Bart Mellish gets through in the official count. Last night, the LNP had a pretty convincing win over the first preferences but the ABC's projection of the final count is quite close (50.7% LNP vs 49.3% ALP). Not sure what the error margins are on that projection but should be interesting nonetheless.
37. Of course ALL LNP members would have been directed to just not "go there" on this one. It needs to be firmly shut down. Best to just not talk about it at all. I agree with their approach
38. Mansfield MP Corrine McMillan labour block few people from block few residents from Mansfield, Mt Gravatt, Mt Gravatt East and Upper Mt Gravatt regarding about roads issues.
39. It's okay. They won't take away your ability to kill unborn humans.
40. Robbie Katter on election coverage live last night said he would still “test the parliament” on abortion rights, whatever that means. So it’s coming. Let’s see is David will keep his promise, or resign also as promised.
41. Can't imagine Amanda Stoker is capable of keeping her mouth shut about it for very long.
42. What's fucking wild to me is that the kids that don't get aborted are probably going to be the ones doing 'youth crime' in 10-15 years, so why the fuck would you get rid of it?
43. When would be tomorrow, if they could.
44. and as a member they're perfectly entitled to. This the democracy we live in Whether or not it gets up in another question. and if it gets up (which I highly doubt it will) the next Labor lead govt will undoubtably sort that out.
45. Welcome to Little Texas boys and girls! Hold on to yer britches coz we gonna go real fast on this here downhill...til we hit the bottom that is.
46. Can't wait.
47. when he rolled his eyes and said "I guess I'll answer this for the hundredth time..." and then gave a waffling vague answer... wanker
48. I can’t believe it’s up for discussion again, surely it was debated intensely when it was legalised years ago!
49. If I need an abortion and this fuck head stops me I'm giving birth to that thing in his yard and leaving it in the mailbox. If he wants it he can have it.
50. Can we still pop over to nsw to abort?
51. Ironically, an LNP majority might turn out to be a saving grace here if the libs don't need to entertain Katter to get other stuff over the line. Depends what their focus groups tell them I suppose
52. Except in his answer he literally said its a low priority for him. He listed all of the constructive things he planned on pushing for agrarian North Queensland, and then said "I've said I'll test the parliament on abortion, so I'll do that. I don't know what that might look like, I haven't thought about it or even planned on it for this election, it just came up. It's not a priority, getting dams built so farmers don't run out of water, and fixing roads so people aren't cut off for 4 months of the year is my priority".
53. Then the LNP will botch the Olympic planning, lose the next election and blame Alp for a poorly funded Olympics. Edit: And people will be too fucking stupid to realise why.
54. State is gonna end up in debt for the first time in yonks and LNP will spend their next stint in opposition blaming Labor for it yet again.
55. [Economic and Fiscal Overview - Queensland Budget 2024-25](https://budget.qld.gov.au/overview/economic-and-fiscal-overview/#:~:text=RESPONSIBLE%20BUDGET%20MANAGEMENT%20%E2%80%93%20FISCAL%20OVERVIEW&text=A%20strong%20net%20operating%20surplus,in%20the%202023%E2%80%9324%20Budget.) \- from the second paragraph: >**A strong net operating surplus of $564 million is expected for 2023–24 compared to the deficit of $2.182 billion estimated in the 2023–24 Budget**. This estimated outcome is the r**esult of careful management of revenue improvements, including royalties and taxes**, so that a surplus has been achieved at the same time as providing additional electricity bill support for Queensland households and small businesses in 2024–25. The 2023–24 estimated actual represents the third consecutive operating surplus of this term of government and follows a record surplus of $13.9 billion in 2022–23.
56. supply-side jesus says that the profits will trickle down eventually, and the royalties will stop this from happening. also, jobs will evaporate if the royalties continue. the companies will take their business offshore, which is a pretty amazing feat, given that the shore and land it's attached to is the entire focus of that business.
57. We missed the opportunity of the decade by electing SlimySafulli. They'll ditch the royalities, sell off public assets, fire healthcare workers, ditch the 50c fares and hike the prices back up... meanwhile Steven was promising to make a public energy company, was going to keep cheap fares, and continue looking out for the average QLDer 😥 I'm actually guttered that the majority of QLD fell for the LNP lies, people consume way too much mainstream media and believe whatever Daddy Murdoch tells them.
58. > For context, in the 2021–2022 financial year, Queensland received approximately $7.3 billion in mining royalties. Retaining even a portion of these funds could have substantial implications for public infrastructure and services. Are you saying the LNP are getting rid of all coal royalties? I know there was opposition to the last increase in coal royalties, but I haven’t seen anywhere that they’re getting rid of the royalties completely. There’s been royalties charged on coal in Queensland since forever, it would be a big deal for someone to get rid of them entirely. Have I missed something here?
59. You use afterpay don’t you
60. That’s the one. Gonna be “fun” so I do hope that if this comes to pass, those who voted for this stand by it and don’t complain as their cost of living spiral even higher.
61. 5) Oh we're really sorry about all that environmental protection that happened, here's a boom goes the dynamite to all of that. Get going BHP, fire that ass up
62. Hopefully no schoolies attendees will die from drug overdose but if any do, their parents should sue the Qld government and whatever muppet they appointed as “Health” “Minister” in their personal capacity. Pill testing is documented and proven to save lives. I mean, it’s obvious that it does but there is actual proof for it too. Canceling it would be a decision made out of actual malice towards the people affected, in order to intentionally cause them foreseeable harm. For a government minister to act with actual malice, is clearly outside of their official duties.
63. !Remindme 1 year I feel naive hoping they don't sell off our energy assets. That's generations of impact, just to benefit their buddies' pockets. Fuck. Oh also: Does transphobia feature in their reign?
64. > 4) Due to 1), LNP will falsely claim that ALP has been recklessly overspending and putting QLD into significant debt that they have to unfortunately cut a few things. These will be, Education, healthcare, 50c fares, energy rebate, rego discount. plebs like you and I just don't understand the economics of “we can’t afford these things now that we scrapped revenue from our donors”
65. Remindme!in 1 year
66. What's a consensus vote?
67. They’ll gut the NDIA too.
68. RemindMe! 1 year
69. RemindMe! 1 year
70. I have been in health for the better part of 14 years (admin stream) mostly temp contracts and temp again now. Within days/weeks of LNP getting in, I lost my job along with thousands of others. It took me 3 months to get back in and only survived financially because I was married at the time. I'm terrified what could happen over the next 4 years.
71. Public servants lost their jobs; health care cuts (we lost our local hospital that was lobbied for and staffed by GPs at the start, lost our aged care nursing home); rampant environmental destruction; jobs for the incompetent boys (and some girls); property developers did whatever; public education not resourced (think it’s bad now, watch for later); extraordinary powers for police (we do need them, they do need resources but with checks and balances that have been sadly lacking). Am really surprised they still don’t require police and credit checks to be openly displayed with voting materials (for all parties).
72. Ohhhh, I'm sorry my human. You're in for a rough time, keep that chin up. Remember, you're all in it together and you're stronger together than apart. If you worked through the pandemic, I also thank you so much for all of your efforts.
73. It was a slightly different climate back then. ALP were almost completely wiped out. I think there were only two or three left in parliament. I worked for qld health and a large number of us were on temp contracts. I saw the writing in the wall and got a job in a private company and then everyone got fired at my old job a few weeks later. We weren't patient facing, and in my specific place of work we spent a lot of time standing around doing nothing because there wasn't enough work, and too many employees. It was absolutely laughable. I know that wasn't the case throughout qld health though. Just my specific workplace (I hope).
74. If you’re able to go private, you’ll probably notice a take home increase, either through more private referrals or contracted inter-state offers. This isn’t a good thing for Queensland, or the profession - since long term it will obviously result in a worse system of care, but short term if you can adapt, it’s an individual boon. What really sucked is the loss of experienced consultants for new grads, reduced public hospital spending really reduces the access to learning for new doctor, since all the experienced consultants tend to go private. In things like Psychology you’re also going to probably see more of a focus on private practice, which once more changes the type of training new grads will get (less acute, out patient care). But yeah, I guess main optimistic bright side is that in the end if you’re in healthcare, your skills are needed more than ever , and you can leverage that if you’re willing to move.
75. What other kind of party is going to be able to compete with the millions of dollars that the Nationals get from mining companies?
76. rupert murdoch
77. Meanwhile, cost of living is actually a massive problem for Debbie. And i honestly didn't see any LNP cost of living policies - did they have any? Any reduction in mining royalties is gonna cripple their ability to roll out more.
78. Personally, I think the solution lies in spending far more money on social services for youths in these areas, most of them come from shit homes where their parents are alcoholics, drug addicts or abuse them. I wouldn't want to be at home at night either when mum and dad have had a few drinks. Build a bunch of social centres open 24/7. Sports facilities, social workers, teachers, beds, washing machines, playstations, whatever. Combine that with changes to legislation giving docs more power to take kids away from homes like these and more personnel. Unfortunately, some of the policies that could make some real difference to kids in these situations have been shot down by noisy left leaning people as discrimination, chief amongst them, the cashless welfare card. The cashless welfare trial was the only time I saw trolleys full of food in the supermarkets in these communities in the NT.
79. I think the problem is this sort of talking down to people like you’re their moral superior. Look at what happened to the Kefus, and realise that multiple people in the same street and suburb have had their car stolen and make a direct connection “that could have happened to me”. That is a perfectly rational reaction for people to be scared in that situation and want the government to do something about it. If Labor had connected a solution that recognised and addressed the immediate problem, and then also the longer term poverty, people would have been more inclined to follow them. You want everyone to check their privilege that they didn’t grow up poor, maybe you’d communicate better if your checked your own privilege too - you’re not going to win points telling people that crime ‘is not that bad’ and calling people stupid, if you’re lucky enough not to be the one suffering it
80. Meanwhile Debbie won’t be there to hold the child’s hand when they’re raped. But will support programs that are anti child abuse without the fucking wherewithal to realise she voted it in.
81. I'm convinced that the it's just a belief of the ruling class that a country needs plentiful struggling workers. You can grow your own or import them. Banning abortion just fattens the struggling class. The scary thing is that I wonder if it hasn't always been this way, you just can't say it out loud. World marvels were seemingly always built by cheap or free (slave) labour. America was built by the 'give us your tired and poor'.. It might be that a country simply can't be all upper middle class but those in power could never say that publicly. So the elephant in the room is a country needs a full cross section of affluence. Don't down vote me because I don't think this is a good thing, I just wonder why as a rich country we can't do better. Obviously the issue that can be tackled is concentration of wealth, that should be top priority. Hypothetically a country of entirely middle class could only occur if you effectively 'exported' the shit jobs to cheap offshore labour, at which point you've abandoned broad humanity benefits in favour of parochial national indulgences.. it's OK for someone to do shit jobs as long as they aren't Australian.. For all of us that think billionaires should do more for us, but then happily go to South East Asia for daily massages and a general sense of 'wealthiness', we are possibly no better..
82. I just don't get why they can't be angry about shit that matters.
83. Just because someone is born in poverty and crime doesn't mean they automatically turn into criminals. There's plenty of people out there born into a situation like above but made their lives meaningful and actually contributed to society and have never committed a crime. Stop making excuses for criminals. These kids know what they are doing
84. What do you say about the gang of young Africans who stabbed a grandmother to death at a Redbank Plains shopping centre and stole her car? The mum stabbed to death in North Lakes at the front yard of her home on Boxing Day? There was Totai Kefu stabbed in his home in Camp Hill last year who didn't serve any time Or the gang who stabbed three randoms in the Vally last year at 3 am as some sort of initiation? The youth crime spree is real, even if rates of crime are lower than a year or five. And that's just Brisbane. Its far worse in other pockets of the state Innocent people are being placed in danger by multiple groups of young kids, and mainstream people had enough
85. you say that, but ipswich and logan voted labor. townsville did vote lnp and i can empathise with them. if fares were 50c in all of qld, we might have had a different outcome
86. Debbie will have to sell her car to make rent, so I guess kids stealing it won’t be an issue for her any more!
87. You yourself sound quite emotional.
88. I think Debbie is smart. Why shouldn't she look out for herself? Why would she want children breaking into her car and that being the new normal? I would vote for Debbie before I would vote for you, that's for sure.
89. To be fair, that is what I voted for
90. Lol but this subreddit was saying people like Debbie didn’t exist and that it was all media hysteria. And now that LNP have won, your comment is top voted hahahaha. So much cope
91. yeah i feel you. i live in north qld, the medical system up here is already overwhelmed. my mil has super advanced dementia and is under 65. the public memory ward has a 5yr wait, the private has 2. the ndis gateway places are fucking useless and only want to help children gain access. i can’t imagine any of that getting better. sigh. i still love you steven miles!!!
92. I work in public mental health in Logan region and I’m scared too. We are already understaffed of clinicians psychiatrist. I’m scared what is going to happen.
93. It is unfortunate, but after the stellar job the healthcare service has done after the COVID pandemic the response from the public is largely a big fist in the oouse. It is again, unfortunate what they think of them. You just have to shrug your shoulders, shake your head and walk away.
94. You're concerned about changing from the government that is currently presiding over 'dismal' system and has for the past decade?
95. You’ve clearly forgotten that Laurence Springborg, as health minister, for the LNP, almost eliminated ramping and had the waitlists on most surgeries down to where they should be. He was the best health minister we’ve had in the 24 years I’ve lived in this state. Meanwhile, labor just keeps spending more money and the problems get worse.
96. After the damage is already done …
97. We are on track to start lowering interest rates and possibly stabilising the cost of living rises. Of course, the LNP will take all the credit after Labor did the hard work. *Before anyone comments, yes I know this is a federal issue. LNP voters will not know the difference.
98. Like I said in another thread, unfortunately there is a large percentage of QLD voters who need to lick the shit flavoured ice-cream now and then to remind them that vanilla actually isn't all that bad.
99. It just seems so irrational to me that as an electorate we need to ‘try’ the obviously worse option every few cycles when everyone can tell you they’ll fuck everything up and get booted anyway
100. It is a tale as old as time and why QLD is known as the *dumb state*. They get all the things that they vote a labor government in for, they get bored. They vote the LNP in and then they demolish everything, they go "fuck what have we done" and vote them out again. The Joh era though.. fuck me. You can't really uncement yourself from the *dumbest state* moniker after that debacle 🤣
101. I feel like it’s too late at that point. A lot of the changes are really tough to reverse. Newman basically caused a lot of consultants to leave public hospitals and go private. My experience was that a lot of those people were very happy working public but it’s much harder to justify going back when you know it’s a pay cut and worse hours (it has benefits but it isn’t as good). I remember my parents leaving public under Newman and I’m so find it strange that my wife and I could end up leaving as well for the same reason.
102. And then they will blame the mess on Labor
