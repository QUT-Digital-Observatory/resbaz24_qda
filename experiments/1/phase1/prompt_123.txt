Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Are you planning on being personally responsible enough to have yourself euthanised when your age makes you a drain on the health system? It's a matter of taking care of yourself so nobody else has to look after you or feed you or bath you, eg.
2. Maybe because they don't want to be made into a political prisoner because of some anachronistic liberal drug policy.
3. Well it's About time they start doing something useful here instead of worrying about middle east and it's terrorists

5. If you took the time to read the very first sentence of my post you’d understand. This post in no way shape or form reflects my political alliance with any party. I am not ‘sooking’ about who won or lost. I am expressing a very legitimate concern for young Queenslanders, specifically children who are going to be made even more vulnerable than they already are. This comes after one of the most progressive policies to be introduced in Queensland that will save lives. I incubated a debate to see how other people felt about the topic. Like you said ‘we get on with the job’. To that, I am. The LNP have made it clear they wish to reform and improve our healthcare system, taking the pressure off an already over worked system. Which is slightly ironic given that they are trying to remove a service that would ultimately remove the need for a hospital in this case. If you can prevent the cause, there’s no need for a solution. That being if they can test the drugs and remove them if they are going to pose serious risk, then the hospital trip won’t be required in 3 hours time for that person. Simply put but I hope you understand where I’m coming from now.
6. The thing is, Queensland state schools are required to provide health and wellbeing education including Alcohol and other drugs as part of that program. Obviously teens are educated and encouraged not to take illicit substances, as it is the easiest legislation to put in place discouraging the consumption of illicit substances. I agree teens should be more hesitant to buy these substances, but the fact is for whatever reason, it **will** happen. People's environment and surroundings, their personalities and beliefs affect their perception of this topic and you can't say that the bottom line is that "people should be more knowledgeable/educated" because for those people, it won't make such an impact.
7. If [young teen] blows a week's worth of McDonald's wages on 'fake' drugs they are less likely to go back to that dealer BUT only if they know the pills they bought were bad or 99.9% sugar or some other waste of money or potential threat to life. It's easy to blame poor outcomes on drink spiking or inexperience and be none-the-wiser. An inexperienced teen who took 2 80% sugar pills thinking it was high quality molly might take 4 next time for an even better effect. And next time it could indeed be a high quality product... or it could be chalk or rat poison or sugar. The whole issue would be somewhat mitigated by removing the criminal element. The only truly effective way to do that is to decriminalise drug use. The only way to stop illicit drug dealers getting rich is to remove the need for a black market.
8. To your second point I say that while we may all dispute the safety of certain substances, he is right in saying that the hardline banning of drugs was touted for political purposes, and it demonised and stigmatised drug use. If harm reduction really mattered to politicians, the extremely harmful and widespread substances to our society (such as sugar, some fats, tobacco to an extent and alcohol) would be controlled in a fashion which drugs have.
9. About the first point you made, Beelze is trying to make the point that these are relatively safe if used correctly (as his example of the therapeutic use of the substances)
10. I appreciate this comment a ton, you give a great proposal for how pill testing can be used in managing the circulation of illicit substances, also highlighting the important next steps we need to take by disincentivising the dispersion of harmful drugs
11. You’re in /r/queensland talking about how rolling back *life-saving policies* might be for the greater good. It’s a very sensitive topic, and it’s only been two days since the election. So I suspect you’re not going to get a lot of agreement around here.
12. Millions here are paying attention and worried about the LNP, honestly the lies and manipulation are very obvious but I could also see it happening federally. Everyone I have talked to that voted LNP thought labor was terrible and mismanaging everything making the cost of living rise, it’s not a facts based argument at all, They all consume the same garbage media, that media is also nationwide. I’m scared for the federal election.
13. I agree there are cohorts of young people that shun education for sure, but as a whole, by growing up with the internet, young people generally have a more balanced wider viewpoint that usually has a more science based, less religious based set of values.
14. If it wasn't obvious (and I guess without a science focused viewpoint it might not be), when I said science I meant harm minimisation using modern approaches such as pill testing, injection rooms, legislation, etc.
15. Spoken with the wisdom of someone who was 17 a couple of years ago
16. Showing your age for sure there.
17. How do you mean stop safeguarding drug use? I believe the impacts of both drugs and alcohol can be absolutely devastating. I have watched it unfold before my eyes and it’s the saddest thing you will ever see particularly with someone you love.
18. It's quite obvious people vote against their own best interests.
19. I think you know the answer
20. [deleted]
21. Actually one of the PHON people in Queensland did come out and say medicinal users should be able to *grow their own* medication. It may even have been pants on herself.
22. They were doing this before the war in Gaza. Are you not concerned about the terrorism being done by Israel upon the people of Lebanon and Palestine? It is possible to do more than one thing at once.
23. Pfft they're kids. Stop beating your chest and protect kids
24. Would definitely agree that if we got rid of the taxes our governments are addicted to on alcohol and tobacco, we would be in a much better place to argue for some consistent standards.
25. Thank you for taking the time to explain your side too. I learnt some things too. Conservatively minded voters like me do care about people and about addressing these problems. We just have a different perspective sometimes. If more of us did what we've just done, we might stand a chance of putting forward ideas that solve the problem.
26. I think you are missing the point…
27. Sort of an aside, there are very interesting discussions happening in the philosophy space. New atheism isn't as in vogue and people are being more charitable around some values that are grounded in religion based on their social function rather than purely the truth proposition. Can be challenging at first if you grew up with new atheism like most millennials and zoomers.
28. Which is it ageing fuckers forcing there beliefs on others or young people who are stupid. Or is it just majority of the state and the public don’t have empathy for junkies.
29. Right. So it’s gone from older people forcing there beliefs on others to young people showing there age. Almost like it’s a wide array of ages and backgrounds that make up the majority of the state.
30. I’m still waiting for the explanation as to why you vote for PHON…
31. Why is it australias issue? Why should Australia have to do anything for this issue? Why are australians forced to put up with useless protests in George street? We are letting people in from war torn countries by the thousands, what more do we have to do? Im more concerned about living costs, housing crisis etc. once that gets solved then we can go down the list of other problems
32. You said it. Kids. Kids doing drugs...... Now listen to yourselves 🤣🤣🤣 growing brains taking illicit substances should not be acceptable.
33. People taking drugs from time to time are very different from hard core drug addicts. Having such a narrow view of drugs and their place in society shows both how young you are and how little you know about the history of drugs and the steps that led to criminalisation. But you make sure you stay on your high horse or just keep your head buried in the arse of said horse..
34. Your use of the term junkies in this case is pretty funny to read honestly. You sound like a pearl clutching grandparent talking about how many marijuanas the teens at the skate park have been injecting. Just yesterday in a post about youth crime you wrote "No one is caring if a kid has a bit of weed or steals a can of coke", but now 17yos at Schoolies having their first cap are junkies so fuck em? You have a seriously small minded view of the world.
35. You have an incredibly juvenile and self-centred opinion. You'll grow out of it. Emphasis on grow.
36. I don't think it's much of a QLD issue but foreign policy is certainly a Australian issue. Australia votes at the UN, has bilateral relationships with Israel and Lebanon and an alliance with the USA, things we can attempt to influence and leverage. Getting back home, the Greens were not in a position in QLD to change ALP policy through parliamentary numbers but the last 10 months of the ALP administration, Labor has been dipping all into the Greens 2020 policy for cost of living relief. I think Labor was able to save up to 15 seats with the changes Steven Miles did and the Greens should get a little credit. [The Greens have been extremely active on the housing crisis from literally feeding the homeless to arguing in all parliaments for rent caps, negative gearing / capital gains tax reform, asking for actual public housing not this social/ affordable housing nonsense, price controls on food, a return to having a public bank, public mining company, etc.](https://greens.org.au/qld/plan) I think the housing, inflation issue is of the highest priority but no one except the Greens have the policies that would actually fix the issues.
37. Ok, but just because you don't want them to take drugs doesn't mean they are going to stop. So why make it worse?
38. How are you going to stop them
39. What do you mean keep my head buried? Theres about to be a hard approach on drugs especially with youth criminals abusing them, couldn’t be more excited for it. Keep the junkies and dealers away from me and my family. Throw away the key as far as I’m concerned.
40. Glad I can bring some humour to your life. Yeah, the public doesn’t care if a kid is caught with a bit of weed. That’s been made clear. I do though, I would prefer the book be thrown at people involved with drugs. Thank god the government agree.
41. Yes, hopefully I grow into the older folks who are “forcing there beliefs on others.” I mean I already have those beliefs, so I’m halfway there hey.
42. Well shit, let's buy spray paint for taggers and order an uber for shoplifters whilst we are at it. They're going to do it anyways.... Let's make it easier and encourage kids to break the law......
43. I don’t think the decriminalisation of cannabis has done anything for youth crime other than selling weed being a far less lucrative career option for kids with nothing going for them, but hey don’t let me stop you using critical thinking
44. For any concerns about dangers to your family … it's probably you; you show a remarkable lack of cognitive flexibility, an anankastic disposition, and a lack of empathy. I pity people stuck with you.
45. Being abusive, a bully, a control freak and sounding like a psychopath will do a lot more harm to your family long term than a bit of weed.
46. Would you prefer to see deadly drugs like caffeine made illegal too?
47. Do you have any arguments that aren't strawman arguments? Supplying spray cans isn't preventing death, supplying test kits can prevent death. Big difference. If you took more than 1.3 seconds to use your brain you wouldn't make such stupid remarks.
48. What a bizarre and dramatic thing to say. I guess you think majority of the state are a danger to there family considering this is quite clearly a position majority of the state are holding considering the results and the LNP now running the show. I have a feeling your family feel a particular way about you, and you have a rocky relationship. We won’t get into that though. 😇
49. Nice. Good thing no one in my family is that. 😇. So let’s focus on keeping the junkies at bay now.
50. Yes, actually. I think caffeine anhydrous should be banned for the record.
51. Their* You've made that spelling error so consistently it's obviously not autocorrect doing that. The easiest way to remember the difference is to notice the similarity between 'here' and 'there'. The word 'their' isn't about 'where'. Conservative parties prefer their supporters to be uneducated people who are too lazy to pay attention to trivial things like spelling.
52. Your comments have revealed your propensity for being an abusive, controlling bully. Best way to make your kids into some kind of junkie. It's a real pity that an addiction to controlling other people won't get you a 'junkie' label. See if you can go just one day without needing to exert control over others.
53. There goes a nice refreshing cup of really strong tea with a twist of lemon.
54. Obviously it’s not autocorrect if it’s an error? Do you not understand how autocorrect works? Lmao. English is actually my third language and is a constant work in progress, I make a lot of errors writing it every single day.
55. Don’t worry, my kids won’t be junkies. What are you talking about ? All I’ve said is I want tough government policies to keep criminals and drug users away from me and my family. Which I’m going to get now 😇.
56. Someone doesn’t know what caffeine anhydrous is 💀. You proposed the question so I just assumed you had a braincell
57. Well hopefully I've given you a mnemonic to help with your English.
58. They might become control junkies but you probably either wouldn't notice or would admire them for it. People who grow up in abusive families often develop control issues.
59. We need to ban *all* the caffeines! Just like we banned all the vapes and all the cannabises! Caffeine is deadly! Won't somebody stop 14 year olds from buying deadly energy drinks!1!!1! /s
60. And hopefully I returned the favour explaining to you that autocorrect corrects errors, it doesn’t create them. It’s in the name my friend, autocorrect doesn’t autocorrect things to be wrong..
61. 🚨 THIS JUST IN 🚨 the most reddit take ever has been released: LNP voters are raising children in abusive households. Incredible stuff, this might be the funniest thing to come from the reddit echo chamber meltdown
62. Nice, resorting to a straw man because you didnt know what caffeine anhydrous was 😆. The fact you’re trying to mock the position by jokingly insinuating 14 year olds shouldn’t have energy drinks pains the entire picture, because they shouldn’t.
63. Autocorrect wouldn't have any issue with 'there' because it is a valid, correctly spelled english word. Much like I need to correct it from autocapitalising 'English'.
64. Yes, they really are. People who vote to lock up abused and neglected children for life are abusers. People who vote to deny poor kids one decent meal a day 200 days of the year are abusers. Stricter punishment and control over reproductive rights had enormous appeal to abusers and bullies. LNP voters are abuse junkies.
65. One of my kids knew a perfectly healthy 14 year old who was found dead in his bed from heart failure less than 24 hours after consuming 6 cans of 'Mother' energy drink in the space of a few hours. Caffeine is deadly. At first I was a little astonished that you thought I seriously want to ban caffeine but in retrospect, not so much.
66. It corrects grammar as well blud. At least on my phone, but I write all my comments from a laptop.
67. This is incredible stuff, I am in awe that I am the one who’s blessed to read this amazing position. Labor voters are abuse junkies as well, they don’t care about the most vulnerable in our society feeling more unsafe then ever (disgusting), they don’t care about anyone who doesn’t live in there insulated bubble (as the ballot map shows.) and they’re still mad at the world unable to accept anyone else’s position on policy, which is why they’re being mocked everywhere online and the real world (it’s amazing.)
68. Yeah, it is, 14 year olds shouldn’t be drinking energy drinks. I think to jokingly mock my position with it is gross. Curiously though, I can’t find any evidence of a 14 year old dying from mothers. Can you give a link ? That is something I would like to read about and a rudimentary google doesn’t bring anything up.
69. Not mine. Mine will cheerfully replace 'reconsider' with 'recollection' if it thinks it should. I have to proof read it way more than my own fat fingered tapping. Can't remember the last time I reddited on a PC.
70. It happened in Bundaberg. At least a decade ago iirc. I don't have a link because everything I know came from people who knew the boy personally.
71. I’m a modern caveman still using a laptop for this shit. 🤣 Genuinely, thanks for the correction and explanation.
72. Curious that never made the news. Seems like something that would be public interest, especially since mother has no recordings of every killing anyone. Strange.
73. It did make the news but I just didn't bother to get any information from the news. This is because the Bundaberg News Mail (which would have headlined the story) has been subscription only for quite some time. Murdoch bought it and shut it down and much of the content is now available most readily on microfilm at the local library. I tell you this as a person who has tried to research other front pages from the not-so-distant past and ended up in the archives room. To aid in your search: the boy was 14; he lived in the suburb of kepnock and went to a high school so named. It's been suggested to me that it could have been as long as 15 years ago. It was not long after energy drinks became a major thing. Is 'Mother' still on the market?
74. Murdoch media have run plenty of stories on people dying from energy drinks, do you think Murdoch is in bed with mother?? You would think there would be some internet footprint from this, especially when there’s nothing about anyone ever dying from mother.
75. Has any teenager died from consuming an excess of any kind of energy drink in Bundaberg ever? Do you realise that the detail that it was 'Mother' brand might not have been published? And the only reason I know that specific detail is because one of my kids was friends with his sibling? And that detail never made it to the news and I am oblivious because, as I explained, it was owned by murdoch, only viewable if I gave murdoch money, which means my ethics make viewing it impossible anyway.
76. I don’t know. But there’s no internet footprint of it, at least in my rudimentary searching. Maybe it’s Chinese whispers with your source being local teenagers, since you don’t like to view newspapers. Fascinating curiosity that is
77. I'm from NSW but looking in, those policies Labor started campaigning on right at the end was Both too late and and didn't do enough for regional Queensland. 55% of Queensland lives outside of Brisbane and narratives build around topics such as crime build far quicker and are traumatising to communities. Statistics end up not mattering to people who live through it or no someone who has. They ended up too dismissive of people who were suffering. It's the same thing that happened to Northern Territory Labor except they also got done in by the NT ICAC finding the Labor chief minister corrupt. If they wanted to retain power, they should've immediately started investing into the justice system the moment these stories started to flood the media. Do something flashy, make it look like you're doing something for these people. On the bright side, Western Australia is looking into free school lunches and breakfast which is great.
78. don't bother commenting? why post the first place? you're falling into the non-democratic trap of only my opinion is right. it is done, our horse didn't win but I'm focused already at picking up the pieces and changing what I can change.
79. Just a viewpoint. There seems to be an assumption that people only made their decisions based on the campaign. I think many forget that many people, rightly or wrongly, had probably made up their minds after COVID. Queensland was seen as a fortress that other Australians could not visit because of the government's policy and various antics. Many people see Australia not as the federation of states that it is, but as a single country that should be able to be freely moved about. On one hand you've got a bunch of anti-vax people within Qld getting angry that they're mandated to be vaccinated in order to work. They're likely to be drawn to the far right parties. On the other hand you have a queue of southerners wanting to get into Queensland, either to receive care, visit dying relatives or relocate, which was extraordinarily difficult to do. In particular, many in NSW saw Miles as childish when he tore up that invoice and media coverage there did him no favours. So come election time, I think many of the southern state refugees and anti-vaxxers had it in for the government. Being parochial and protective probably turned out to be a damaging factor for Palaszczuk and Miles. I know many Redditors don't like to hear angles they disagree with, but I seriously think a strategic election blunder was seeded earlier than many realise.
80. Labor lost because they did very little to invest outside of the south east and Brisbane city. Look at the map, Labor will win 2-3 electorates outside Brisbane fringe. Youth crime isn’t a city issue anywhere near the extent it is a regional issue, talk to anyone from Townsville, Cairns, Rockhampton and they will have themselves or know multiple people affected by it, I have and I do. Regional QLD had been getting screwed by labor vilifying mining and farming communities yet using the royalties to give city dwellers cheap fares. Regional voted LNP in and it would be foolish for either party to neglect regional electorates again.
81. It's the Murdoch and Nine media, plus now the ABC (it's headed by Ken Williams, who's worked as Rupert Murdoch's top man in Australia and started Sky News). For a decade they've been screaming Labor bad, LNP good and, recently, about a crime wave that doesn't exist. Repeat a message often enough and it sticks. Give it six months to a year and the electorate will probably be baying for blood, but the lessons of Newman have been forgotten and now must be learned again. On top of that there was an influx of people fleeing to Queensland from Victoria and NSW, cashed up and demographically therefore more likely to vote LNP. There doesn't need to be that many joining an electorate to change its voting profile. Some SEQ electorates grew by 15%.
82. I voted LNP because Labor allowed the Unions, particularly CFMEU to become tyrannical, bringing countless construction companies to their knees and reducing productivity to pathetically slow levels. I voted against Labor because of their footballing of Olympic infrastructure. Palasczuk was too scared. Miles had a chance to show strong leadership when he got in and actually get the stadium ball rolling, instead he was too scared to make a decision and he played the political game and handballs it until after the election, wasting precious time in getting something started. I voted against Labor, for their fear campaign and rather late pie in the sky policies. The huge 'cost of living' handouts that came in recent months that were clearly a lunge for votes. Roll-out of road infrastructure in the last 10 years has been terribly slow, with all decisions taking too long, construction at snails pace and by the time anything is finished, congestion has already started again. Their weak stance on conservation areas. They leased national park land to private companies for rich people to camp on, which should never have happened. They wanted to do it more, but the people pushed back and prevented them from doing too much. Plus still approving large swathes of koala habitat to be obliterated... Miles himself, a deer in headlights, useless as a minister, a puppet as deputy and played way too much politics as premier.
