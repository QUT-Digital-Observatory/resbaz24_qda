Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Perfectly put. This is exactly what the issue is and the KAP "tinkering" with late term abortion laws will allow for more suffering as pointed out now by countless medical professionals. How arrogant to try to write laws against the advice of professionals.
2. So my original point still stands. It is a bill that KAP wants to introduce. KAP are the enemies here so target them. Who knows, they may have shot themselves in the foot and lost votes as a result. If the LNP are allowed a conscience vote, that would mean that not all will vote the same way. So if all the ALP and Greens vote for pro-choice and some LNP members will vote pro-choice also, then the bill may not even pass. So what percentage of LNP members will vote for pro-choice should KAP bring a bill to the table?
3. If the bill is to be introduced by KAP then target them. If there is no bill introduced then there is no issue hey. LNP has stated they support women's rights to choose so why keep banging on about it if only for the fear campaign? Youth crime is an issue in the regions. If these city dwelling ALP stooges had of addressed the concerns of the regions instead of ignoring it, they would be a shoe in to win. Now if they loose they can suck a dick and reflect upon the fact that there is more to Qld then the SE corner. As for your bulk billing, I think you mean the new ALP "Patients Tax" which the LNP has promised to repeal if elected. Again, a city dwelling tax that will detrimentally affect regional services, but hey, it's only the regions so who cares/s.

4. Update: Crisafulli has stated that he will allow a conscience vote. There goes Labor's entire argument in a simple sentence.
5. TIL. *Noted with thanks.*
6. So women in Queensland who have an anti-abortion stance have your support ?
7. Yes I did a fee free TAFE course (animal care) a couple of yrs ago and it got me a job in the industry before I'd even finished the certificate. I was pretty impressed by my TAFE experience compared to the uni degree I'd been previously doing haha
8. That does tend to kill Labor in elections the federal Labor Party won because they weren‚Äôt pushing ambitious policies. Shorten on the other hand offered a large number of changes and they weren‚Äôt even that amazing. Simply put Left wing policies lose elections in Australia
9. You've really bought into the Labor advertising BS, haven't you? Explain how small business will be worse off under LNP. And with small business being better off, so will QLD. Women... I'm not even going there. You're obviously not smart enough to investigate what smears Labor have been putting out there. Public servants: don't really give a toss. They're a minority, and if a government is going to increase public servants simply to better their jobs data, then there comes a time where fiscal responsibility requires a cull.
10. Gotcha!
11. Did you... Champ? I love the finger pointing then the ignorance that follows. Typical leftard.
12. üòÜüòÜüòÜ Keep going. You've offered nothing except a phrase. Please point me to LNP the policy that states that minors will be abused. I want policy, not your deluded interpretation.
13. What bullshit? They have been guns blazing but most of what I've seen seems pretty backed up to me
14. He‚Äôs on record saying he would not prevent a conscience vote. That‚Äôs why this is a very real threat if LNP win the election as they would likely have the numbers if a minor party tabled it even if it‚Äôs not party policy.
15. Are you arguing so what or do you just not understand how landslide wins impact politics?
16. ...but it's women who are impacted by the vote. They have this decision pushed/forced on them. There are more men in the LNP making this decision....about women
17. You do realize a "conscience vote" is by the members, not the fucking public? How many women representatives do you think there are? And then how many not right wing nuts do you think there are? You are delusional. Go back to your swamp
18. That is a really sad and unfortunate story. I am so sorry for the loss of your friend and what they experienced. I have so much love and sympathy for good fathers however my opinion stays the same. Until you are the one forced to birth and deal with all the permanent body changes that go along with it, then sorry but you shouldn't have a say. I wish you nothing but kindness. Your kid is lucky to have you.
19. Because they know people are seriously hurting in the real world and this is an easy one they can promise the world over but when it dosent eventuate, they can rightly point out they don‚Äôt have control over the price settings of private companies. Much like ALP don‚Äôt have the ability to just tell companies to reduce their prices when we are experiencing global inflation. They can only work to control the aspects they have control over (like public services - 50c public transport etc).
20. Well the LNP have basically all voted against access to safe, legal abortion in the past so there‚Äôs a clue for you. Their position on the issue is known, so stop trying to obfuscate the issue.
21. I think you‚Äôre confused‚Ä¶
22. I support their right to oppose abortion, they can choose however they want with regards to their own body. They don‚Äôt get to make choices for other women though. Edited for semantics.
23. I'm so so so happy to hear you took advantage of it and it helped you! Well done for taking the steps and doing the hard work. üëè
24. ALP under Shorten didn't campaign strongly enough, didn't spell out why they wanted the changes and sell to the public the positives they would bring. It was a grab bag of policies that were not sold well nor integrated into a larger vision of where the ALP wanted to take Australia. Shorten himself didn't actually believe in the policies he was championing (he's from the part of the ALP whose main difference with the LNP is being somewhat embarrassed when admitting to sending their children to private school). It's a self-fulfilling prophecy, that the right and "centre" of the ALP love as it gives them the perfect excuse to be a party that does nothing to challenge the current status quo because they benefit from it personally, and they'll be damned if the leave the ladder out to let anyone else experience class mobility (unless its a one-way trip down). And they use it to avoid easy wins, because they disagree with the fundamentals - i.e. championing a resetting of the MBS and indexing it properly would see immediate results in increases in bulk billing, but instead we get "urgent care clinics" and various MBS loadings and incentives to at least get concession card holders bulk billed.
25. Well first off there‚Äôs no money going towards a renewable energy transition which is not either sustainable nor efficient for energy/its prices. The promise to revoke coal royalties means Australia‚Äôs miss out on earning from our resources to multinational companies. Dunno how that‚Äôs good for QLD. lol and it‚Äôs always the small business prerogative with the LNP and u people isn‚Äôt it, a strange pattern. Public servants execute policy. How do you expect anything to be actuated when they get axed again? ‚ÄúBetter their jobs data‚Äù is the most blindly idiotic and ignorant statement ever‚Ä¶clearly you have no clue how the public servant system functions lololol. ‚ÄúThe minority‚Äù yeah thousands of people who will miss out on jobs because the lnp are hijacked by coal and minerals and they don‚Äôt wanna be taxed so let‚Äôs just axe the essential jobs to make some money. Your not going to go to the women abortion discourse because you don‚Äôt want to explore the fact that the opposition leader now favoured to win has avoided questions on abortion conscious voting more then 100 times. If Kater raises his bill I don‚Äôt think anyone expects David to be able to control his party from passing it. And the only people that will be rooting for are complete slimes destroying a women‚Äôs right over her body. Idiot
26. You‚Äôre not very good at this. Take a seat.
27. Your a flog mate. its not that hard to do a quick google search!
28. They also vying to get rid of preferential voting. That will murder labor even more
29. If you point me to a poll which predicts a landslide result that'd be great.
30. Nope . Not true really. Many women truly aren't controlled by this sort of thing at all. You and i might say we are, but its a matter of perspective.
31. Plus some of those women are in favour too. Doesn't affect them?
32. Fair enough. Well I will wait and see. I voted Labor for the federal election but felt it was time for a change.
33. So still on the scare campaign trail....
34. Ok , from the original post you seemed to be of the opinion that women were all aligned regarding abortion. Clearly there are many women who are anti abortion. Its good to see you support the choices of BOTH sides .
35. It's 'you're', not your. And Crisafulli stated, just this week actually, that he has no plans to change the abortion laws and his party will be allowed a conscience vote if the motion is brought by KAP... But I'm sure you've chosen to ignore that part üôâ. And it's Katter, not Kater (but thanks again for pointing out your low IQ)... When the LNP takes a majority Government tomorrow night they will control the narrative and not rely on KAP to maintain their position, but keep lapping up that Labor rhetoric... Idiot. And way to talk up the public service! A whole waste of money on inefficient bureaucracy and meaningless bums of seats which the Labor government loves to promote as jobs creation. If you had any level of fiscal understanding on a macro level then you would know that Australia's population is WAY too small to have three levels of government, so why boost a workforce that creates very little except a hole in the balance sheet. Have a look at the portfolios and understand the horrible performance of pretty much all of them: health, emergency services, the courts, education, transport, infrastructure, the list goes on... Idiot. Renewables... Divulge the renewables you are advocating for. Wind? Bahahahahaha! Solar? Bahahahahahaha! Hydro? Yeah, OK, but where? We don't have the infrastructure to either create or carry the energy from the areas of rainfall to the metro areas. And the Labor government is opposed to nuclear, so tell us more... Idiot Having a grasp on economic stimulus would tell you that if mining companies are passing on leases due to the highest mining royalties in the country, multiple times what the other states are charging, then mines do not go ahead, ala Glencore's decision to withdraw from their plans for a $2b operation. That's thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of $$$ worth of expenditure and therefore investment into the QLD economy evaporated. That one single mine offsets the royalties, plus more, that your buffoons are currently charging. Maybe if the mines went ahead they would have ACTUAL jobs creation data to spruik instead of simply adding to the public service numbers and the all cost, no benefit situation that requires undoing. Also not sure why you're cutting the benefits to Australians (you wrote 'Australia's' and got that wrong, too. Plus no apostrophe required), as this is a QLD issue and a state election, not federal... Idiot
36. Better than you and your blind following of the Labor party... Enjoy the election coverage tomorrow night. I'm looking forward to a very early concession by your Pied Piper üéâüéä
37. *you're, but thanks for highlighting your lack of intellect in addition to your previous comments. A Google search won't show up your delusion. It will only show what has been published. I'm asking you to justify your fantasy, because it doesn't exist in the real world.
38. Yay for taking away rights women have fought for for decades, even longer considering the many ways people used to cause abortions for thousands of years. Guess we are just going to go back to coathangers in a back alley?
39. Yes, but there has to be the ability to choose. Not one side removing that choice from the other.
40. Nice book you should frame it ahahaha This has been fun baby girl xx ü§°
41. What we were discussing is the use of fear based campaigning **in lieu of proper policy positions**. Labor has those. The LNP does not. You brought up abortions ‚Äî the count on Crisafulli dodging the question is over 132. He waited until after the media blackout to release his costings. His main slogan that hints at policy is the inverse of all researched back policy on reducing crime rates. You don‚Äôt even understand the argument you are failing to engage with. If the LNP win tomorrow, which I think is likely, it‚Äôll be bad for both of us. But at least I‚Äôll be cognisant of the reality we live in.
42. no point arguing with ya. bye!
43. Surely you understand the Democratic process ? The majority will decide what is acceptable to society. So its the majority , not "one side" I dont have the right to rob or assault someone just because "my side" thinks its ok. Society has decided that behavior is unacceptable .
44. Shame the level of understanding required was well above your pay grade... Where's your renewables argument gone? ü§∑ Pretty thin from the outset. How embarrassing for you. There will be more fun tomorrow night! And you will be hearing from me when I message you to gloat over the result üí™üí™
45. See, that's what you've missed with your one eye... The LNP has publicised more policy than Labor (and their 'free lunches for schoolkids' brainwave). Small Business, as I own, is on its knees in QLD and the Labor party have shown no desire to assist us here. I have 28 staff who rely on my business to put food on their table. None of us are public servants (which I suspect you are) to guarantee us an income. The whole premise of Labor's late success in shifting the needle in the opinion polls has been the fear they have created about late term abortions. To give them credit, they have been hugely successful in this, but only because the average layperson isn't smart enough to understand the intricacies around this being KAP policy, not LNP, and the other simple fact that a motion like this would NEVER, EVER be passed through any Government in Australia, irrespective of individual politicians' personal or religious beliefs. Yet, you talk about the fear that the LNP is spruiking. Again, pot/kettle. In addition to the above, you are carrying on like your life will be turned upside down when the LNP win tomorrow night. Unless you have a job or a Govt contract that is at risk, it won't make a pinch of shit to the sun rising in the east and setting in the west, and your life will largely be unaffected. Ultimately, same as mine, but I'm just seeking some support by moving away from a Government who has done nothing for me and anyone like me.
46. No point, because you have no argument. So, bye! I'll be sure to message you tomorrow night when Miles concedes.
47. Apologies I'm late getting back to you... I was too busy celebrating such an emphatic win by the LNP! üçæüçæüçæüçæüçæü•Çü•Çü•Çü•Çü•Ç
48. So you‚Äôre saying LNP supporters all oppose abortion? And trying to conflate robbery and assault with a woman‚Äôs right to choose what to do with her body shows your level of understanding in this matter.
49. üé£
50. You‚Äôre not equipped for this. Stop trying.
51. No , I am saying : 1. Not all women are pro abortion 2. The 'right" to an abortion depends on what our society determines is acceptable according to the Democratic process.
52. www.seek.com.au Your public service position will likely come under threat. Start looking for another job, Drop Kick
53. Apologies I'm late getting back to you... I was too busy celebrating such an emphatic win by the LNP! üçæüçæüçæüçæüçæü•Çü•Çü•Çü•Çü•Ç
54. Actually the right to abortion depends on the views of the political party in power. Those views don‚Äôt necessarily reflect the views of the majority of affected people.
55. Mate I live in Melbourne Ahahaha Your so easy to bait
56. ?
57. The "right" to anything depends on the law. We vote for parities that will put laws in place that reflect our values . What is worrying is when some people want to ignore this , claiming there is some "right" that in fact many in society do not agree with. Not everyone agrees that abortion is the womens choice at any time for any reason . Not all women are pro abortion. Queenslanders will vote in the Govt. of their choice and any subsequent Laws will reflect the way Queenslanders think . That is how it should be,
58. Again, it's 'You're' not your. Just how dumb are you? Joke's on you if you live in Melbourne üòÜüòÜüòÜ. You fuck wits voted Dan Andrews back in after COVID. The guy who's just this week been spoken about as the WORST performing Premier in the history of the country! What a great job you and your constituents did at the polls! Another reason why Brisbane and QLD has now leapfrogged Melbourne and Victoria as a desired place to live.
59. I thought I'd be sure to message you to gloat once the MAJORITY of QLDers had their voices heard and the result was clear, not just a few one-eyed Labor die-hards on a leftist social media platform. Surely you didn't expect that you weren't going to hear from me?
60. Ok boomer
61. The finish is back to bite again üé£ü§°
62. I just read your recent comment history‚Ä¶ Drink plenty or water. Maybe call your mum sometime. Be kind to yourself. I‚Äôm about to make a tuna bake. It‚Äôs easy, inexpensive, and a very cozy dish. Would recommend!
63. What does that mean ?
64. Apologies I'm late getting back to you... I was too busy celebrating such an emphatic win by the LNP! üçæüçæüçæüçæüçæü•Çü•Çü•Çü•Çü•Ç
65. That's fuckin gold. Honestly the cardboard cutout probably did a better job at winning votes for the LNP than Bleijie would have.
66. Does anyone need a reminder who Jarrod is? Is it a mystery to the entire state why the Deputy Leader and Newman's henchman is laying low? Pink jumpsuits? What did it solve? Nothing. A reminder it was Labor's cleanup laws that actually made a dent on bikies. This guy was an absolute disaster and nearly none of his work as Attorney General remains. Here we go for Newman 2.0 under the current LNP.
67. That's alright, every question can just be answered with "its (option:not) part of our plan for Qld". The CM won't know how to report the difference.
68. Imagine having to lug that thing around. You wouldn‚Äôt be able to bring it close to a school or any small children.
69. Your annual reminder: "Campbell Newman, Jarrod Bleijie's aborted defamation defence cost Queensland taxpayers thousands" https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-31/campbell-newmans-aborted-defamation-defence-cost-qld-thousands/7798538
70. bloody hilarious
71. Jarrod Bleijie is a perfect example of who to not vote for. He‚Äôs acting like an absolute ass‚Ä¶
72. Great strategy. JB has little recourse at this late stage.
73. Bleijie the little wesel grub.
74. Jarrod Bleijie-Petersen
75. Hahahaha
76. Jarrod Bleijie is electoral poison. We haven't seen him because of the damage he caused last time the LNP was in.
77. He‚Äôs up at Cairns lol I was chatting to the Labor candidate for Buderim (Adrian - great bloke) and I asked why only he was at the only pre-polling booth for Buderim and he told me Mark Mickelberg was in Caloundra (for some reason) and yeah Bleijie is up hiding in Cairns and Fiona just hiding as well. LNP hiding their politicians and just relying on their fear campaign to get votes.
78. Cameron Dick's first best friend.
79. Probably got a lot *more coherent and intelligent responses* from it as well...
80. Double D demonstrating how much of narcissist he is. Truly deserves the moniker of Dick by name, Dick by nature.
81. Probably provided more answers than Bleijie would have too
82. Certainly far less arrogant, and still more progressive.
83. The cardboard has an outline of a ~~man~~ plan.
84. They sent him off to the regions as part of 'Operation Boring' during the 2015 election too because he was such a liability. [https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2015/01/inside-operation-boring-lnps-strategy-reclaim-queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2015/01/inside-operation-boring-lnps-strategy-reclaim-queensland) (paragraph 25) He has improved a little since then - he no longer makes the fashion faux-pas of matching his pocket square with his tie. Other than that, no.
85. This guys was a junior solicitor that become the bloody attorney general
86. Get one of the buttons that say ‚Äúit‚Äôs not part of our plan‚Äù and press it every time they ask a question
87. "acting" you say.....
88. Yes, but unfortunately the LNP rusted-ons in Kawana will re-elect the dropkick.
89. Literally a conveyancing clerk‚Ä¶
90. "Will you have a budget surplus?" "Do you oppose corruption in government?"
91. There might be a change! My Nan lives in that area and used to be friends with him prior to politics through their church. She‚Äôs no longer voting for him and neither are several of her other friends from church. I know that‚Äôs only a couple of people, but it could be a sign of change in Kawana.
92. Never say never.. he‚Äôs an ass and is showing it for everyone to see‚Ä¶
93. Fair dink. I heard the Steven Miles is a union stooge, has only ever worked for trade unions and has never worked in the real world before becoming a professional politician. There are people here that would trust this bloke with our tax money, yet he would not know the value of a dollar? Strange hey.
94. The new Labor candidate is a lifelong local and all-round legend. Won't switch this time but the wheels of motion may be on their way (hopefully).
95. This is 100% code for cutting funding to the NGOs that provide all of Queensland's services.
96. Its good to know that they are planning to do a lot of cuts, Classical position from Ex-newman government politicians I wonder if they will try the privatization strategy like they touted when they were given the boot.
97. Chainsaw consultancy? What a dickhead.
98. How dare Labour get any consultations about complicated matters from anyone outside of the minerals council of Australia. Fucking hippies!!!
99. So the LNP are finally admitting they shouldn‚Äôt have reduced the civil service‚Äôs capacity over the decades, and toning down their rhetoric about how ‚Äúsmall government‚Äù is always ideal? I wish that were true. They‚Äôll probably just stuff the new Consulting Agency full of folks who‚Äôll tell them exactly what they want to hear for a fraction of the price of KPMG.
100. So basically press undo on their 2013 cuts. Good The public service never recovered.
101. $6 billion in savings is laughable.
102. Having worked for Qld Health for a while I can confirm the consultancy bills are outrageous. Delloites provided a "Director" position. Normal Directors are around $150-$160k. He was being paid $300k and his accomodation paid etc. etc. It was a criminal waste of tax payers money.
103. Do we now get shit loads of consultants in so our public servants can do even less? $6.8b is a shit load of dollars. We pay public servants to do this work but looks like they cant be bothered so contract it out to others? I hope if the LNP win they bung some KPI's on the public service to see what sort of efficiency they really work to. In my line of work, if I don't perform and meet production targets, then I will get the arse. The same should be the go for the public service. We would see some budget saving then...
104. [removed]
105. What? Have you seen any of the news regarding the corruption and dishonesty from the big four accounting firms over the past 24 months? Might be time to stop looking at tiktok and wake-up to the real world.
106. unfortunately we all cannot copy the homework of the other party.. someone has to actually look in to the issues that make the decisions.
107. You might want to google ‚ÄúPwC scandal‚Äù‚Ä¶ brace yourself btw.
108. Honestly, if these fuckers get in, I genuinely fear for my job.
109. They won‚Äôt create permanent roles to replace them
110. What like the lnp leader who ran a failed business?
111. Let me dovetail that point then with the deputy Jarrod Bleije. ALL of his Vlad laws were repealed and the bikes were dealt with in quieter and MUCH better ways. Some of his attempts at legislation were stuck down before they could be debated because they were straight up wrong and then we have his attempts at diddling with same sex unions and other anti LGBT community legislation. For all the experience he has, I expect the same level of gross incompetence to drive the "conservative" agenda and put people in stupid pink jump suits. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-06-17/jim-thomas-calls-jarrod-bleijie-removed-attorney-general/5528982
112. Cool story 18 day old account.
113. A quick google will show that Miles was the managing director of a public relations agency and only succeeded in.getting elected in 2015. You can also check on the Deputy leader of the LNP who was elected 3 years after he graduated from university, I would suggest Bleiji has limited real world experience as well, then there is the would be Premier who spent 3 years in the real world before starting to work for the LNP, sorry, forgt to mention the 2 year period after he lost his seat in 2015 when he searched for a safe seat.
