Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. A government that allowed what was described as the biggest criminal forensic lab blunder in human history does not deserve another go.
2. i've been scrolling & reading for a while, have people realised what LNP will be doing??? like holy moly
3. Honestly‚Ä¶ no one I know will own up to voting LNP‚Ä¶ someone had to. And here we fucking are.
4. The labor government Olympics plan was a hunk of shit that they backed themselves into and weren‚Äôt able to back out of it without losing face. That doesn‚Äôt mean lnp will do anything better necessarily, but there is a good chance they will, because qsac is the stupidest idea ever
5. Some bloke very proudly posted on r/Australia that he voted LNP because he was basically taking the risk on a change of government making things better, didn't know about any of the policies and admitted that he knows he's going to be worse off financially with LNP in power, the stupidity is never ending
6. I swing far left and generally vote greens, I think Miles odd a pet good and honest bloke. Many feel in my circles that 10 years is enough for a good democracy. Also Greens only caring about Palestine and marching at CFMEU rallies didn't help.
7. I never vote LNP ever but if there‚Äôs one thing that hope comes out of this is that the ex car dealerships on Anzac Ave in Petrie get something done. They‚Äôve been a fucking eyesore for the entire last Labor government which refused to progress it at all. Genuinely 10 years of arson, vandalism and just bullshit. So it‚Äôd be nice if something happened with it. I‚Äôm sick of fucking looking at it.
8. Was more 100% bulkbilled gp clinics not a good ideaü§î
9. you are all sounding like Americans right now, with the position that you can't even be friends with someone who has a slightly different political perspective to you. It's been the downfall of America with extreme polarisation and echo chamber mentallity. Get a grip
10. I remember last time they got in.. I work in a public hospital. And it was baaaaad with all the cuts of staff.
11. I just wish there was a party that sat in the middle, I like some policies on both sides, and our only choice is to pick the least shit of the two.
12. I had someone tell me that ALP was protecting paedophiles because LNP was bringing forth Daniel's law.
13. I think the answer is people think on balance, the LNP may be better for at least the next term, having regard to what the ALP has been or has not been doing. I think it's lesser of two evils this time. Conventionally, my impression is that the LNP is harsher, so they are good at dealing with problems with harsher measures but people vote the ALP back in once those problems subside and we want a more socially progressive party to equalise the rights of various groups in the community.
14. They won‚Äôt waste $2b+ pa on a misguided ‚Äúschool lunch‚Äù program
15. To all the people saying 14000 healthcare workers lost their jobs last time around, well a lot of these were useless placemats. Clinical vs admin ratio has gotten worse and worse last few years, actually being a doctor and trying to get shit done at places like Ipswich or Logan is next to impossible. LNP might screw up sure, but I‚Äôm willing to give them a chance. Also the abortion thing is pure fear mongering from labour. If libs ever touched it they‚Äôd be voted out in a huge landslide next election. I think Crisafulli actually wants a legacy other than that of a 1 term premier.
16. **Briefly**, Youth Crime. **Longer response (Trigger warning):** Perhaps this sub's main residents are from well-to-do suburbs who have never first-hand faced these issues, but from what I've seen there has been (a) lot of inter-state immigrants, (b) teenagers seem to have crime immunity. Inter-state immigrants change voting demographics. The suburbs have been very closely fought, with ALP wins being with barely 500 to 1000 votes in many places. So, yes ALP has lost more ground than meets the eye. Secondly, there have been quite a few break-ins into logan, GC and other non-core brisbane suburbs by minors. Police don't register cases, and just let the teens go, even if the home residents try to hold them with evidence (like video). Worse, they get threatened/warned for unlawful withholding (like kidnapping) or assault on the youth even if the owners were just trying to defend themselves. Some suburbs like Pallara, the people took it on themselves and patrolled their own streets at night because neither did the police did anything (cos they couldn't due to the deliquents being minors) nor was their any recourse. This did go up on the news a while ago. Yes, there is statistics that this sub loves to quote *"buh buh buh stats says youth cime is reducing! Science no lie!"*. Tell that to the neigbourhood which was affected and maybe never included in the stat due to cops just letting them go without any reports (or as "unknown persons"). There was no politician or politics involved when your neighbourhood was robbed and you learn you are legally powerless. Stats take a back seat when you see a safety issue in your own locale, even if the even was once a year. I am sure no one wants the police to put kids in Jails. Their main hope with change in government is to bring the fear of the law into a demographic (youth), who currently appear to be legally immune. Note: These are votes from people who voted labor for their mayoral/council candidates. P.S: I don't have voting rights in Australia yet, so these are just observations.
17. Dont mind ALP but they seem to be soft as fuck on crime / sentencing minimums / general law and order. Thats only reason i voted LNP
18. I don't think it's too difficult to understand why people voted LNP given the cost of living and housing crisis. It's the same thing that's been seen all over the world when people will vote for someone else no matter how good or bad that other party is.
19. 1) Reduce union influence 2) Reduce number of youth crime victims 3) Reduce ideologically possessed lefties to tears
20. You might hate the LNP but the LNP does get stuff built, in all states and federally, they may run the state into the ground financially but they get the ball rolling. Just look at NSW, the LNP planned and started building a bunch of metro lines, then Labor got into power, saw the projects were bankrupting the state and canned a few of them. The LNP got the first few built. The olympics shenanigans would be more clear under LNP than Labor, probably one of the most promising outcomes of this election. Everything else though, not so much but hey atleast the next election will be a crushing defeat for them considering the LNP track record in QLD time after time again
21. I am passionate about politics, a post graduate economist and a swing voter at the state level. Typically I swing based on specific issues as I find both parties rarely stick to their 'values'. Last election I voted ALP due to assisted dying laws. This time I voted LNP as: 1. Stamp Duty is the most inefficient tax and appears to be the easiest lever to pull to improve housing affordability. LNP are removing it for first buyers of new builds. A step in the right direction but such an awful tax should be eliminated. 2. ALP were proposing price controls on petrol, state owned petrol stations and energy retailers. This is dangerous territory, expanding the role of government significantly out of the bounds of where it should be. The policy intent is a good one but the actual outcomes of these types of policies is the opposite. This announcement made voting LNP a no-brainer for me. I still feel sick voting for a party that had the gall to have a billboard with 'Adult Crime, Adult Time". I have a hope that it is more just fear mongering/vote grabbing rather than a slogan that will convert to actual policy.
22. No friend I have voted LNP
23. CFMEU
24. i cant think of any good reason. maybe they hate women
25. The amount of times I saw street interviews with people saying ‚ÄúI voted liberal because I always have‚Äù or ‚ÄúI voted liberal because my family does‚Äù was infuriating. Having grown up in a family that were purely LNP voters because ‚Äúwe just are‚Äù to the point that anything that was said by Labor was instantly deemed worthless, I had to make the active effort to unlearn these biases and do at least some basic research. Voting because everyone you know voted that way is mob mentality, a concept that has proven incredibly dangerous and counterproductive throughout all of human development (barr the fucken cave men) It‚Äôs the same with all the people I saw voting against Labor because they didn‚Äôt like Miles‚Äô face. Like come ON. We are meant to be adults, that means actually taking responsibility for your actions and decisions. I am worried about losing the cheap public transport and the cost of living relief produced from the mining royalties, but weirdly enough I don‚Äôt really have a right to worry about myself when the election effectively turned into a race to become the US. I am so sorry to everyone that the liberals and the minor parties are going to hurt, and to the women of QLD, I can only hope that Crisafulli turns out to have some integrity and stick by his word that abortion will not actually change in his term. It‚Äôs been a disappointing and infuriating result for quite a lot of us, so all I am holding on to is the possibility that Crisafulli turns out to be a much different person when not in opposition, because his track record in both politics and business seem worrying.
26. Friend of mine today said he voted LNP because he hates unions. That's it. Didn't seem to.know what he'd actually be voted for in terms of policies.
27. Voted LNP to see Reddit go into melt-down. It's as if everyone here lost a personal gaurdian. Surprisingly, only 31% of Qld residents preferenced the ALP, so Reddit really is a weird little ALP enclave.
28. Time for a change if nothing else. The Reddit community ‚Äòbubble‚Äô is obviously overwhelmingly pro Labour, you need to leave the ‚Äòbubble,‚Äô in particular go out to the regions to see some of the issues people are facing outside the SE Qld ‚Äòbubble,‚Äô to get an understanding. Not everyone‚Äôs priority is abortion, and some of the other issues I‚Äôve seen people raging about on this forum, which I suspect reflects the Reddit demographic. You won‚Äôt get much understanding here in the Reddit echo chamber.
29. Brother thought labour was being pretty useless but he wasn't happy when I told him what the party he voted for was actually saying. He just wanted change but didn't actually look.
30. I‚Äôm sorry to be the student here guys but would any one be kind enough to give me a quick run down of what tf is going on in Australian politics lol Appreciate any ones help! (I‚Äôm from the uk)
31. SkY nEwS sAid GoOd So MuSt Be GoOd!
32. "Sometimes you just need to change things up, even if it's not ideal"
33. *I don't hold a plan mate*
34. My friend voted because he saw youth crime. Happen once, and thinks it‚Äôs on the rise and he is aging.
35. As if there's any difference. Both are inept, out of touch and most likely corrupt
36. ‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt stand Steven miles‚Äù
37. I have my fingers crossed we get a kick ass new stadium for the Lions and Olympics. I hope it guarantees test cricket in Brisbane for at least half a century. That would be a decent legacy in itself imo.
38. Can anyone point to the major policies where these two bunch of numptys are any different ??? Like seriously what policy , did you feel truely was different and said I'd vote for you. Same same but different.
39. "Miles gave me the ick, I'd never date him" ü•≤
40. ALP signed up for the Commonwealth games and olympic games. Huge loss leaders. That's why. Billions of dollars lost at each of them when hosted. And everyone's worried about the economy because of LNP....
41. literally the only difference between Labor and liberals is 3 years
42. I think many older persons and those with families are very concerned about youth crime. Crime has also impacted many and people are sick of seeing news stories on it so a change was needed. I don‚Äôt think free lunches got people over the line at all. How many households would that even apply to in the scheme of things.
43. I voted LNP I‚Äôve voted for labour previously. At this point I take the policy out of it as stuff all changes these days. We need to hold both sides accountable for stuff ups that cost us be it LNP or ALP. That‚Äôs how we should all vote‚Ä¶. Too many fk ups and your out. Maybe they‚Äôll learn that way.
44. Nuclear power. That's the only reason I voted for them
45. I have family in Townsville/NQ. They voted liberal primarily because of the youth crime slogan, which tbh I kind of understand. (Even if I don‚Äôt agree with the policies LNP have proposed to achieve this). Youth crime may be dropping state wide but up there it‚Äôs increasing. I have family members with PTSD due to being victims of it. It‚Äôs an issue for many people up there with strong emotions attached to it. Emotions can cloud judgement on the ‚Äúhow‚Äù - they‚Äôre just happy someone has taken a strong stance on something that has terrorised them. But still fuck the LNP.
46. A lot of people I know really didn't like miles idea for QE2 stadium, crime stats and the state budget issues.
47. My local LNP member has actually been fairly proactive in the area over the last 4 years, and managed to retain his seat for the next 4. Does also help that he's the rare breed of politician who *genuinely wants to help his community* and isn't just in the role to benefit his bank account....
48. Easy, because they are both equally incompetant in different ways and the best thing to do is swap them over as often as possible to get the most balanced outcome.
49. I‚Äôm the first to stand up and say I know bugger all about politics and strongly agree with a comment on here about better education on the subject. I voted alp because I have personally felt the hand from labour. Contracts get cancelled, withdrawn when labour is in. And yes it happens midway in government contracts. About thirty of us were laid off because labour got voted in last time and that was just our area it happened to the vast majority of people in the industry. (It‚Äôs a federal contract.). Literally almost overnight we went from having work to no work. I‚Äôm not sure why but when liberal are in people seem to spend money. When labour get in, they stop spending.
50. Most people don't know who the National party is. Never taught in schools. Without the two parties combined both State and Federal would never get a majority on their own right.
51. LoL üòÖ and here I was thinking this wasn't disingenuous... My bad.
52. Yuck. Free Palestine.
53. LNP is more supportive of mining and, like it or not, that‚Äôs where the money comes from to sustain a first world society given the lack of manufacturing as compared to pre-Lima Agreement times.
54. Democracy is not a winner take all event Needs to be deep seated social contract
55. People vote for the LNP for 4 reasons. 1. They hate a group/type of people. 2. They have short term memory issues and no desire to learn anything about politics, Australia and the economy besides what their lord and saviour Rupert Murdoch tells them. 3. They are wealthy and have vested interests in the LNP and can profit from them being in office. 4. That's who their family votes for and politics are boring and it doesn't matter. That's it. No exceptions.
56. Swing voters swung hard. It‚Äôs a cycle.
57. Many people I know who vote LNP have always done so because their wealthy parents have done so. So not really a positive reason, but a reason‚Ä¶
58. As someone who keeps out of politics because of toxic personalities dominating social media, and don't watch tv or listen to the radio. I found there was practically zero reliable information to help me decide. I tried to google LNP policies, ALP policies and just get returned with the same junk, mostly news outlets sprooking their agenda and reddit pages consisting of insufferable people calling anyone who doesn't vote the same way "Idiots". Had there been itemised breakdowns of what is what that showed up after 5 mins of googling, I probably would have voted differently.
59. When will you all wake up and realise you are libertarians?
60. Because Crisafulli looks like he will actually get shit done, unlike Miles who comes across as a spoilt private school prima donna and typical 'public servant' who will talk alot but get nothing done... Also the ALP abortion scare campaign was ridiculous.
61. What the actual misinformation campaign was run in QLD? The answers on this are blowing my mind. It should be a jail-able offence to spread this type of misinformation.
62. Because I chose to vote mainly based on candidates rather than political affiliation, and the LNP candidate for my electorate is a decent person who does lots for the community.
63. To keep crims in prison and reform them , ALP have also over spent, which fuels inflation. There is no such thing as "free"
64. A friend was voting LNP because Labor kept interfering with small-scale(usually recreational, not making enough money to sustain yourself, if any) sapphire mining claims in the gemfields. So they're hoping voting for the LNP will help keep towns running in the gemfields with tourism rather than have to close up shop. Reading the comments, It seems to be a pretty consistant issue for Labor and the greens tbh.. not listening to queenslanders outside the city.. Something for next time.
65. Being concerned about your future because one shit gov replaced a previous shit gov speaks volumes about the lack of self accountability we've developed as Australians. The percentage of your potential linked to a state government is way smaller than the mental energy you all spend worrying about it. Go outside
66. My parents voted LNP because of Labor had been in too long, hated the idea of school kids getting free school lunches (my Mum was a former Teacher and really pissed her off about the school lunch idea), my Dad is a bit conservative and has always hated Palaszczuk and was happy when she quit but also thinks there are too many public servants. Plus they're really concerned about the state economy and massive debt. Plus the Olympics fiasco and how we are going to afford it.
67. Because labour has been in power for 30 of the last 35 years and have been shit.
68. Every time I sit in a traffic jam in or out of Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast (on the Bruce Highway), I know whose eyes I‚Äôm cursing.
69. I didn't vote for the LNP. I voted against the ALP. The unconstitutional attacks on the building unions, the ones that initially founded the Labor party, deserve a total reset of the ALP. The federal branch is next...
70. My local Labor candidate has no political experience and was running on a try something new campaign essentially.
71. The construction unions are out of control. Labor has no solution to address housing shortages. We need the change
72. I have shares in mining companies. Future outlook is positive. /s
73. [deleted]
74. Because their opinion was the LNP was the best for the state for the next 4 years. In their opinion it was the best option. It‚Äôs the reason 99% of people vote for any one. Either that, it‚Äôs because they just randomly did because they liked the colour blue more etc. This is something more prevalent with enforced voting. The old adage, I‚Äôm in the booth, may as well pick someone.
75. All the tolerant left trying their best to insult their own because theyre but hurt their party lost‚Ä¶ badly
76. Of the 5 friends I‚Äôve spoken to, only 1 voted. They‚Äôre all under 30 except for one (and he‚Äôs a die-hard Trump fan who would only care about AusPol if Trump was running). Pretty much sums up why LNP won imo. Not positive per se, just pointing out that Crisafulli likely benefitted from the staggering sense of ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äô coming from people under 30. I think if either party had committed to stable housing or affordable rentals, the impact could have been huge.
77. How I voted my ballot in the Clayfield electorate: 1. LNP 2. ALP 3. One Nation 4. Libertarian 5. Greens A few reasons that influenced my vote: - As a single 29yo I don‚Äôt see too much value in cheap public transport or school lunches I would rather see the government use funds to lower my taxes or improve the services I use. - I did not appreciate the fear campaign by ALP and moreso ABC news ran around abortion policies despite both major parties committing to not making any policy changes in that space early on. - Over the years I have considered many of the ALP policies and decisions irrational . - My landlord is a good man I hold in high regard who promoted LNP for the area he has lived in his entire life. - I saw multiple federal greens member in protest photos where people held signs promoting harm to Jewish people as well as terrorist symbols. I cannot consciously vote for a party or any member in it that share these values or don‚Äôt hold their people accountable for this. What I‚Äôve learned from the election results: - Here in the big country city we are making decisions that negatively influencing rural Queenslanders and we need to be more considerate to their needs. - Reddit seems to blame legacy/murdoch media for the way QLD voted while being blind to their own media bias. As a result they dismiss the QLD voters as uninformed or mislead without putting much more effort in understanding their concerns. Thankyou.
78. In my house it‚Äôs greens last, Labour second last, some other guys next and LNP or Pauline‚Äôs team top 2 in any order.
79. Because people want a change from our government following the lead of Biden et al. Americans will probably get the change they need shortly.
80. This is democracy? Tough luck deal with it or go live in Russia.
81. Rusted on Labor supporters are always a good laugh. Keep it up sooks.
82. I voted Labour. I‚Äôm not upset that LNP got in. Changing of the guard every few years encourages fresh ideas and fresh approaches - not only for the new incumbents but for Labour too.
83. Ultimately, I vote for the canidate in my electorate that best represents me. They are LNP. In the past I've voted red. In addition: 1. Labor havn't been great with the economy. 2. Labor have treated the business community with disdain. Consultation doesn't happen, silly decisions. 3. I don't think they've taken crime seriously
84. Because Steven miles is a slimey weasel
85. You're only concerned because you want to see the country go down the toilet. Wake up to yourself!!
86. Because they support small business
87. If you find any actual positive reasons, I'd like to know. LNP are great at shit taking labour, not very good at getting anything useful done for the average Joe. If you're a big corporation though, I'm sure you'll be getting some tax breaks soon.
88. I don't know any fuckwits that vote LNP or NO on the Voice referendum or read or listen to Murdoch news or Facebook or Twitter because I and my friends aren't gullible mouth breathing fuckwits!
89. A consistent concerted attack for 4 years proving that DC is able to take the helm and with a strong message on items Labor didn't really want to touch, ultimately turned into a smeer campaign from Labor, we are all over Youth Crime/Crime, we are over the corruption that Labor did consistently and without being held really accountable and the handling of COVID definately affected way too many people for many reasons - the Olympics handling is a shitshow - plus I voted for LNP to do a reset as no one in the Labor party front bench has Oppostion experience so will allow the LNP to go free for all and get things into line again for Labor to eventually take over again.... LNP winning is a good thing to all those Labor voters, but we all need to hold LNP accountable for the promises , i.e reduce Ramping Times was one that stands out as a hard metric and clearly the prmises coming out today, being help accountable is what makes things work. My 2 cents FWIW. Oh and on the topic of "mum and dad" and "boomer" being the ones only voting LNP it appears there was a strong \~20 year old voting section sick of Labor and Green unrealistic bullshit..... go QLD.
90. Voted liberal because I'm still bitter about the COVID over reaction and border closures. I couldn't see my family for two years and missed my father's funeral because at the time NSW had one COVID case Stuff Labor Plus Miles tried to buy an election by adding more and more to debt that our children will pay for
91. I didn't. I think Steven Mike's was doing a good job.
92. [deleted]
93. I'm not interested in excuses from those self-interested judases
