Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. >I know many women who had to be hospitalised in the lead up to their births for many different reasons, if they hadn’t acted and gotten medical intervention many of those fetus wouldnt have been born. **Highly reliable sourced data set, I'm actually amazed that someone with so much concern about these laws seriously didn't take the fucking time to actually read the explanatory notes of the amendment.** >i were born months premature via C-section as my umbilical cord was wrapped around his throat and he was lacking vital nutrients without that medical intervention we both would have likely died **Whats wild is LNP are actually advocating for** ***people in that situation*** **essentially but instead it would be phrased without the "*****C-section" and with "termination"*****, Unless you think once you were removed from your c-section and needed healthcare but your parent said "nah we not want" you should be excluded health care and left to die.** (again not forcing the life onto a mother... but just providing medical care to a pre mature neonate; like you were once apon a time) *This Guideline stipulates that in instances where a “baby is born with signs of life and survival is determined to be unlikely,” the guidelines state that “active treatment” is not recommended. The Guideline suggests a range of other best practices including the establishment of “local procedures for the management of live birth,” including offering counselling and other services to parents, handling the baby gently and wrapping to provide warmth and offering parents opportunities to engage in care provision such as cuddling/holding. If parents do not wish to be involved in palliative care provision, the Guidelines stipulate that healthcare providers “may provide comfort support strategies”.11* *While the present iteration of the Guideline is an improvement on the previous version which stipulated that “if a live birth occurs…do not provide life-sustaining treatment”, there remain ambiguities which require addressing. First, if a live birth occurs following a termination and the baby has no life-limiting condition and is on the threshold of viability (ie. after 22 weeks and 6 days) or older, it should be clearly stipulated that life-sustaining medical care should be provided to the child irrespective of parents’ wishes.*
2. >a women “keeping herself healthy” is taking action. Nope, it's just staying alive. If that's wasn't the case, then abortion wouldn't even be a thing. A woman who didn't want her baby could just do nothing and it would die. But that's not how it works. As long as the mother is healthy, the baby will be healthy apart from miscarriages. >an elite athlete choosing to have a baby is going to lead a very different lifestyle then she normally does, as would many different women from many different walks of life. my mother took the action to quite smoking when she was pregnant, many women stop drinking, avoid raw fish and certain foods. I know many women who had to be hospitalised in the lead up to their births for many different reasons, if they hadn’t acted and gotten medical intervention many of those fetus wouldnt have been born. There are no elite female athletes. You must mean professional female athlete. Yeah, so a woman's actions is going to affect the baby's health, but you're talking about stuff that damages the woman too. Smoking isn't healthy. Still won't kill the baby though most of the time. And talking about difficult pregnancies isn't relevant either, cuz that's very much the exception. >i’m a twin, my brother and i were born months premature via C-section as my umbilical cord was wrapped around his throat and he was lacking vital nutrients without that medical intervention we both would have likely died Okay, so you're again talking about preventing a miscarriage, not a healthy pregnancy. >shows how very little you know of pregnancy to assume that 100% of women who lead healthy lives give birth to healthy babies I didn't say 100%. Plenty of women have miscarriages. I've read stuff that suggests miscarriage is really common, to the point where early miscarriages often go undetected, since it happens before the woman realises she is pregnant. But for the majority of women, if they do nothing but live healthily, keeping themselves alive, then the baby will be born. It's not a possible baby, it is a definite baby, so you can't escape moral responsibility for abortion that way. >a bundle of cells Haven't heard that excuse for a while. Do you know why no-one is outside dermatologist clinics protesting anyone that goes inside to get a mole removed? Cuz a mole is just a bundle of cells, it's not going to grow and be born. >choosing to have your body ripped apart months early to hopefully save one of your dying fetus That's also not what we're talking about, that's a medical intervention attempting to prevent a miscarriage, not a healthy pregnancy. >i feel sorry for your mother that you seriously think pregnancy is a walk in the park as long as you’re healthy I never said that either. I know pregnancy is an ordeal and it takes a toll on a woman. My mum had 5 of us, and the last one required her to be hospitalised a lot. The doctors told her not to get pregnant again after that, cuz it would probably kill her.
3. You're acting like pregnancy is skydiving without a parachute, rather than a natural and essential process for keeping the species alive. You're not talking about bodily autonomy, you're talking about body destruction, of the baby. It's a big sticking point for the pro-abortion crowd, "My body, my choice." But the body of the baby is what is under discussion. Pretending the baby doesn't exist is insane. Recognising the baby exists and saying you have the right to kill it is insane. The only ways it can be a thing is when the pregnancy was caused by rape, or if there are medical issues. Even then, it's a sad thing, like euthanising a pet. So no, pregnancy healthcare is not complicated by default, anymore than any healthcare is complicated by default. You're hiding behind the problems that a minority of women experience, and also trying to say that only people with medical degrees can talk about the continuation of the species. So yeah, you're really not being honest here.
4. **17% of babies were** ***special care nursery*** **(SCN) or** ***neonatal intensive care unit*** **(NICU)** In 2022, almost 1 in 5 (17%) babies required admission to SCN or NICU. Babies were more likely to require admission if they were born pre-term (77%), First Nations (24%), of low birthweight (74%) or born as a twin (61%). *Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.

5. **The baby is premature. (We know that is certainly not ideal)** *"The QNMU says the study “excludes neonates with major congenital anomalies”. The study found all neonates born at 22 weeks received intensive, invasive medical intervention, a third of which died before the age of 18 months, and of those that did survive, 38.9% showed moderate or severe neurodevelopmental impairment, the union says."* **33% died within 18months. 66% survived with -moderate to severe neurodevelopmental impairment.** So kill 62% because 38% won't make it to two? idk dude i would say we save 66% and grieve 38% rather than just decide that the 62% are too autistic to exist, but i guess we think differently as we are "allowing them to suffer", All the people that are content and live fulfilled lives with neurological developmental disorders i guess are just coping and they deep down wish they were just killed as babies....

7. Can’t help but make lies up when its only a couple of comment ago. Read it slowly it might click . Ill get you some crayons
8. Where in that sentence does it say Im Fantasizing about you being stoned to death. With all due respect I am but I haven’t said that and as I said with all due respect I can say what ever I want
9. are you stupid? a misscarriage is also called a spontaneous abortion, a women choosing to end a pregnancy is an induced abortion. you literally did say 100%, and you seem to be straight up pulling stuff from your arse so you can try to justify why a miscarriage from things like alcoholism or substance abuse just doesn’t count in your book i guess??? i genuinely don’t even know why i’m arguing with someone so incredibly dumb that i almost feel like this has to be bait and i’ve just been played like a fiddle, it genuinely scares me that people like you can vote.
10. Insane how you can't see your hypocrisy at play here... Your own mum, if she had gotten pregnant again, would be one of the many to require an abortion for medical reasons.
11. The terms are irrelevent, whether you call it a choice, an abortion or the killing of a baby, the same thing is happening. It is interesting though. What happens when a couple wants a baby and have a miscarriage, what language do they use? "We lost the baby." But if the couple doesn't want the baby and have an abortion, what language do they use? "We terminated the foetus." Same thing happening, but different language depending on how people feel about it. If it is wanted it is a baby, unwanted then a foetus. >you literally did say 100% "the baby will 100% be born unless there is a miscarriage" A miscarriage happens when the pregnancy is unhealthy in some way. >a misscarriage is also called a spontaneous abortion, a women choosing to end a pregnancy is an induced abortion. When the pregnancy is unhealthy, there can be an induced abortion or an induced miscarriage, the terminology is really at the discretion of the users. >a miscarriage from things like alcoholism or substance abuse just doesn’t count in your book i guess Of course it counts, there are all kinds of damaging things a woman can do to harm her baby. But again, abortion wouldn't be a debate if ending a pregnancy was as guaranteed as simply being a drug addict. There are heroin addicted women who give birth to heroin addicted babies. >i genuinely don’t even know why i’m arguing You are arguing because you are in favour of a terrible position. If you lose the argument, you either have to accept that, or change your position. It's the same reason why anyone argues anything contentious.
12. terms absolutely arnt irrelevent, i don’t have to win an argument with you to know i will always protest for a women’s right to choose, i don’t need your validation in my morals i’ve spent a long time defining them for myself, you’re basing a lot of your argument around colloquial terminology while rejecting laws and biology which to me just makes your argument weak. i still have yet to see any evidence that any of you actually care about children once they’re born (i mean you said yourself you wouldn’t give up a bit of your liver and kidney for one so…) even though you stand on your soap box declaring that women who have abortions are killers and as bad as murders and rapists (something you directly said earlier) i will always say it is a step back for our country, a step back for our healthcare, and a step back for feminism in australia.
13. How do euphemisms change reality? The choice you are fighting for is the choice to kill one's own child in the womb. Hiding behind the word "choice" cannot change that. It is killing. Not as bad as killing, it is killing. No, I wouldn't donate half my liver and one of my kidneys to raise a child. Great argument. I have thought about organ donation over the years. It's quite different from changing nappies and feeding a child, don't you think?
14. why wouldn’t you donate an organ you don’t need to save a life? women who are forced to have babies arnt always the ones to raise them so i have zero clue what nappies have to do with this argument, im not saying you should raise a kid im saying if you’re pro life you should be pro life in every aspect of your life, that includes frequent blood and plasma donation, signing up to see if your a kidney donation match ect. if you value life so highly why would you not give someone the opportunity to live through your own selfishness of your organs you don’t even really need? i’ve seen plenty of pregnancies that have much worse recovery then organ donations so if you’re fine forcing women through that in the name of being pro life i think we should force you to start contributing more to saving people’s lives.
15. What are you even saying lmao? "someone wants your organs u should give your organs to people because you think babies that was planned to be terminated but happened to be born live (pre-mature neonate via fetus outside of mothing in a living state) should be given access to medical care (the same medical care you litterally received as a neonate because of your condition...)" >**Achievement of Policy Objectives** >*The bill will achieve its objective by amending the Termination of Pregnancy Act.* >*A new section 8B is inserted into the Termination of Pregnancy Act.* >*S 8B (1) identifies the section applies when a termination causes a baby to be born.* >*S 8B (2) states that any duty a participant in a person’s birth to provide appropriate care to a baby born as a result of a termination is no different than any duty they would have to a baby born in any other way.* >*S 8B (3) clarifies that the “appropriate care” means medical care and treatment that is (a) clinically safe and (b) appropriate to the baby’s medical condition, while “participant in person’s birth” clarifies that the subjects to whom this section applies are the same as those outlined Termination of Pregnancy Act; that is to say, the registered health practitioner who performed the termination, and any other practitioners, including students, present at the time of birth* Please do show me where any females are forced to birth and restricted abortions; You're hysterical
16. Ahhh yes the classic 'calling women hysterical to try to delegitimise their valid fears' approach. You have no clue what you're talking about, this 'babies born alive' bill has nothing to do with protecting those (non-existent) babies and everything to do with chipping away at abortion rights. It's a tactic straight from the seppo forced-birther playbook, they literally tried it again over there a few years ago and now the christofascist nutters here are giving it a red hot go. The aim is to erode abortion rights through lots of little pieces of legislation that introduce more and more restrictions, whilst intimidating medical professionals out of performing abortions via the threat of legal prosecution. But congrats for falling for the transparent appeal to emotion that the whole bill is designed around. The LNP and their ACL buddies are counting on the Australian public to be as stupid and easily influenced as you so keep up the good work champ! 🙃
17. “females” “hysterical” ok bud i know exactly the type of man you are. any restrictions on abortions is a gateway to much more intense restrictions.
18. I didn't refer to anyone by their gender for 1, for two Legislation is as it is written.... Reading it would make it very clear that concerns raised by the people in this forum are infact nonsense. "the seppo forced-birther playbook" / "christofascist nutters" Do you even know what fascism is lmao? you realise people voted for a state party and above that is a federal party and that we are further apart of the commonwealth... You're so fast to bring into question my intelligence yet you're entire view is one of conspiracy without providing any actual evidence of your claims. "appeal to emotion" - You're angry people care about premature neonates? And even if this party decides to push for more changes in the future you realise that is irrelevent to the current amendment right? you know why they are called amendments right?? You also realise that each amendment is voted in as a separate change right? I would also really encourage you to understand people will have apposing views in a democratic society, I understand you seem to think babies that are alive but were not wanted shouldn't have right, i personally think that baby has the same rights as any other baby. Therefore this amendment doesn't raise any concerns to me. To say Im easily influence and unintelligent for not believing in your tales of "chistofascist nutters" that have sole judgement and hearing over laws but only change a subsection in enforce what was a guideline to the actual bill; But then you act as if they have completely destroyed the previous amendments is very much hysterical and nonsense. When really its you that is easily influenced that a party you disagree with puts an amendment to a bill that involves abortion that you connect them to violent bombings committed by [Eric Rudolph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Rudolph) and the [assassination of George Tiller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_George_Tiller) at his [Wichita, Kansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas) church in 2009, acts which were motivated by Christofascism.
19. You know what, I voted for Labour. Now that I have given my vote and the party didn't win, I will just sit back and watch. If that is what the Queensland people want, then that is fine. If you don't vote or you donkey vote, you have no right to complain.
20. Yep democracy works best when all you do is shout 'adult crime adult time' in response to any policy question.
21. Pretty low effort post, but I’ll bite. What LNP policy in particular was the big draw for you? Edit: the coward was so quick responding to everyone but it’s been over an hour now and I’ve gotten nothing but silence. He’s too afraid to communicate a cogent thought on his political ideas because he knows that brought to any scrutiny they’d all fall apart. His only playbook is to act aloof and insensitive to mask this. Classic type.
22. > also Reddit is not the real world. does anyone actually think reddit represents the electorate? like, actually, not just vibes.
23. Is this your "Fuck your feelings" moment? Do you understand how much you sound like MAGA in the US? Maybe kiss my arse!
24. Imagine "GO SPORTS TEEM" is how you approach societal management. OP needs to finally make a friend.
25. OP definitely wanks to posters of Hiltler while he lays in his race car bed.
26. Stop feeding the trolls.
27. ‘The electorate never gets it wrong’. It gets the government it wants. This is democracy.
28. 100% lol its literally a self contained echo chamber.
29. Reddit is a leftist echo chamber. Any pro ALP or Greens post gets praise and it's obvious. I will now withdraw from reddit tonight and return to my upper middle class setting of home ownership and a decent job.
30. Anyway, you can’t always eat Mars Bars. Looks like the Crunchie gets a go for a while.
31. You’re deep throating the boot so much OP it’s coming out your arse.
32. The majority **didn't**vote for the LNP (or any other party). A majority would be 50%+1 Seems you're the one with something to learn. Try again.
33. I always wonder what people think of their vote for Newman in 2012.
34. What about if you pay taxes but can't vote. Do you have a right to complain then? That applies for many people... Of course they have a right to complain. This "you don't vote, you don't have a right to complain" comment that people in make every election is such a very tired, rubbish, false comment.
35. The majority voted don't like it go to a country where there no democracy
36. I’m 43 and have only ever voted ALP, including on the weekend. The OP is right. 2 days ago someone on here was saying how you can’t have a different opinion with right wing voters and I got downvoted for saying the left is the same. Learn how and why the Australian political system works and is fair for both points of view and stop taking things so personally. It always swings close to centre at the end of the day. The voting majority and not left nor right. They’re centre with hovering views on certain issues.
37. I reckon it's a toss up between "That's not part of the plan" or maybe "There will be no change"
38. I think it’s probably their policy of being huge fuckheads.
39. LNP have already scrapped the outrageous decision to host the Olympics in Mount Gravatt so that’s one positive at least
40. This subreddit is a massive echo champers lol
41. Don't hate the player hate the game.
42. I think OP is Ralph Babet.
43. ahhaha xD
44. They will never tell you. Their shame is obvious when you look back of the last few weeks and see the lack of comments about policy from liberal voters, and I dont mean propaganda from the Liberal party or the Coal lobby.
45. Less than 12 months later, you could not find a single person who would own up to voting for him.
46. My opinion is about if you have a choice to vote and you chose a poor behaviour. If in your situation and you pay tax, then complain away.
47. "don't like it leave" is always the dumbest fucking response to an election result no, i'm gonna stay and vote again next election.
48. What, like the US?
49. That would mean more if OP had even stated a position in the first place. He didn’t do politics, he just poked fun!
50. yes, no one is disputing that. but you can be in an echo chamber and *recognise* you're in an echo chamber, and most of us do.
51. Your mums fanny's a massive echo chamber
52. I hate Hitler and the game he played. I hate Netanyahu and the game he is playing. I hate you for telling me to like eating your shit. You play a sick game.
53. Voted for Newman in 2012, in fact I was in the paper in between him and Lisa as he grabbed me for a yarn at Payne Rd School voting station and a photographer took his chance. I was a public servant then but as someone working in a critical area of service delivery my job was never in doubt (nor was it for ~92% of everyone else). Anna rehired the same number x2 as were let go, so essentially a net gain for the state.
54. Yes then do that. This is a free country I have the right to my own opinion.
55. Mad your party lost sucka?
56. Most sane response.
57. So does the guy you responded to and yet you tell him to leave? hypocrite.
58. Bro this isn't a sporting event 🤣
