Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Yes, yet the government can find funds for ego projects and entertainment for the masses. eg. Annual firework shows that benefit no-one, contributes to air pollution, frightens the animals and costs tens of thousands of dollars. I‚Äôm sure there are other examples of ego projects; oh, how about Olympic Games, Commonwealth games, endless sporting events. It seems we are re-living the last years of the Roman Empire where the people were kept happy with entertainment whilst everything around them collapsed.
2. Because homeless people have been doing homeless people things
3. The Catholic church is hoarding it's cash for all the abuse pay outs it needs to make now and into the future.
4. They are one of the groups helping the most to provide support, actually. A lot of the people at musgrave are there because they don‚Äôt like the supports offered.
5. I agree, what is wrong with these cunts? Fascist fuckers wanna kill women and now the homeless. If I say what I wanted done to these pricks - I'd be put on a list.
6. Bad planning is not the issue here. We are discussing providing the bare minimum of support for homeless people.
7. Find me an article where ALP have cut electricity to homeless camps and called it a "safety" measure and I'll call them deluded pieces of shit too. I look forward to your reply. Ty in advance.
8. Source, smooth-brain?
9. Parks are actually public and shouldnt be ‚Äòfor‚Äô any particular group of people
10. The role of government is to serve and provide for the people. The homeless are people you degenerate.
11. so ban renters too?
12. My rates and taxes should be helping the homeless‚Ä¶ who we are failing at an increasing rate. Until our governments provide services and places for these people to safely live so they have a damn chance of getting back on track, these types of setups will happen. The blame lies with governments, who are at all levels, failing us.
13. Ratepayers huh? I guess we should shoo all those freeloading tourists out of Southbank and the like right? So I know, if you lose your house though no fault of your own, where ARE you meant to set up shop? Thats a really shitty "fuck you, got mine" comment.
14. How can they pay rates, if they can't have a bank account, because they have no address. Where can they cook, relax, sort their possessions? Think about the personal experience rather than the label
15. Yes, cutting people with no resources off from the supplies they need to live is definitely the best solution to the tent cities cropping up. Where do you propose they go? Out of the city to the suburbs?? To different public parks?? Street corners?? There are no resources for them right now, so kicking them out is nothing other than a cruelty
16. What a degenerate, psychopathic take.
17. Also, if they can‚Äôt afford bread, let them eat cake. Quote: Marie Antoinette, not long before the French Revolution.
18. I agree to some degree. But this sub is pretty much 95% greens, socialists and communists hence the downvotes.
19. It‚Äôs a humanitarian issue, and all levels of government are responsible.
20. less people using cars = lost revenue on fuel, tolls etc. companies which donate heavily to the LNP.
21. It‚Äôs so dumb. Even if they‚Äôre greedy, there have been so many studies that prove if you put money into helping poorer communities you always make at least $2 back to every $1 you spend. You basically double the growth of any community you do this in. But they always make the same excuses that some people will live off the money and be leeches but so what? If you‚Äôre making double the return who cares if a few people want to live that way?
22. >100% his honest response to this would be ‚Äúhomeless people don‚Äôt pay rates so why would we do anything for them‚Äù. That same sentiment got an overwhelmingly positive response on this sub only a couple of days ago.
23. Of the many things bcc could be accused of in terms of malfeasance, I didn‚Äôt think hostility for bike riders was a thing.
24. So figure out what they need and give it to them (electrical access wise). It would be a lot cheaper than repeatedly fixing illegal electrical work. This doesn't fix the problem at all, they still need electricity, they still need to be able to use the internet and they still need to be able to communicate. It's hard enough to get out of homelessness as it is. The only thing this changes is where it's happening. Desperate people aren't going to suddenly stop doing desperate things.
25. You assume these 205 people own a home or have means or space. Bold.
26. The rhetoric around this reminds me of the poem Allowables by Nikki Giovanni.
27. My tired morning brain read this as the Hogwarts years. Then I realised those books were written around then and had a look: Howard government: March 1996 to December 2007 Harry Potter books: June 1997 to July 2007 Gonna refer to the Howard government as the "Hogwarts years" from now on üòÇ
28. So bloody true, mate. I feel like almost everything is for sale. Now, even struggling kids without support at home are for sale. "Build a private prison, please! Here's 80 million to keep the lights on while we keep the poor kids coming." Phillip Ruddock's wet dream.
29. Barbecues that have been disconnected from power according to the article.
30. Homeless people in the city are not an issue for the city council to solve. Interesting take.
31. Really? I hadn't heard that. Sounds like a recipe for disaster to be honest. State government gets to approve development and doesn't have to deal with any of the problems it creates.
32. There's more bottle necks to development than simply zoning. Developer would happily build medium to high density in the inner suburbs but that's where all the nimbys love so we're being forced into smaller blocks and strata in the satellite cities where the undeveloped land is and not enough residents to kick up a politically significant stink to raise the draw bridge behind them.
33. Hey! How dare you?! That‚Äôs a well regarded and established local community business! It just happens to be owned by my mates. ‚Äî the LNP, probably.
34. https://7news.com.au/news/qld/tents-handed-out-to-shelter-homeless-dumped-by-brisbane-city-council--c-12391183 The LNP council joins in on damaging things too.
35. I hope they damage *your* property.
36. Don't insult cockroaches! He's more like the wet soggy sink bits stuck in the plug after handwashing dishes.
37. "Have you tried not being poor?"
38. Reality is these people need electricity and instead of offering an alternative solution they offer an unwinnable proposition to those doing it rough. Alternative solutions could involve working with the local charities to setup some temporary accomodative area's with a safer local access points for electricity. A similar thing was done when the bcc facillitates pill testing at festivals and admittedly this costs far more than temporary accomodation in a rough area.
39. Well spoken Roxy ! share the love
40. In my local park, they do exactly that. they‚Äôve spliced the wiring from the light poles at musgrave, but they keep a low profile, no one cares. One is a muppet who keeps pinching bicycles, but the rest all seem like they are battling their demons, but still present enough to be friendly enough no one really cares about them being there.
41. Because people who are reduced to living in a park are well known for having the physical, mental and emotional resources to manage their environment effectively‚Ä¶ I would have less of an issue with the power being switched off if there was a comprehensive, holistic support plan to go along with it. Right now, it just looks like the cruelty is the point.
42. After the few bins in the park fill up, where does the rest go? If people wind up trashing an event space after being there for 6 hours, and a family fills upwards of a single wheelie bin and a half of trash a week, what are multiple familys in a place with few trash disposal locations going to practically do? what happens when they collect it in a bag and a gust of wind takes it because you dont want to sleep next to a bag of trash inside a tent? where do you shower after chasing down slimy trash blowing in the wind? I am NOT saying its right, or ok, even the 6 hour event trash is disgusting, but we already don't have enough bins in the city to handle a days worth of snack wrappers, this is mostly a logistics issue rather than a trash behavior issue.
43. well put !! Thank you
44. Grift? These are people homeless due to a housing crisis.
45. I feel you have a very jaundiced view of what has bought this to fruition. the last 20 years ????? hardly !!
46. No, it is the consideration that should be shown to others. And vandalism should not be tolerated by anyone !!
47. And it‚Äôs not council‚Äôs job, who have really clearly defined and legislated responsibilities, to solve their mental health and addiction issues. Nor is it the role of people who have opted into the social contract, pay their taxes, rates, etc to be infringed upon by people who have opted out. Parks are paid for by rate payers, they have a right to the safe and peaceful enjoyment of them, that means, yes endearing yourself with some basic decorum. Or to put it another way, if you can‚Äôt play nice with others, you should be removed from play time (restorative justice.) Ideally we would have a social safety net to catch these people, but there is also always going to be a subset of people who various reasons e.g. mental health, addiction and trauma, continue to opt out. Again, that‚Äôs not a council issue, that‚Äôs a state government and justice issue.
48. I also live nearby, and there is daily smashing bottles, fighting, yelling, and other kinds of drama going on. You can't go near the area without being yelled at, intimidated, or asked for money/smokes. This is a public area that our tax dollars pay to maintain, and it's currently unusable due to the dangerous conditions (broken glass, shoddy electrical work, drugs, human waste, violence, etc).
49. Name calling is not an endearing quality !! People can still act decently ........ maybe you could offer them your place !!
50. in the ABC article 2 days ago there is a photo of the side of the bbq missing with various phone chargers and paper rubbish on the inside of the BBQ, i assume there is a normal powerpoint on the inside of the bbq for maintenance use
51. forced open the door to the BBQ's to access power, destroying them !! also the box on the lightpost. They are dangerous grubs !!
52. "Cursed are the meek" said Jesus, as he gave another beggar more leprosy
53. Do you think we have time said the priest
54. Yes let‚Äôs rig up more illegal wiring so the people in Musgrave park can get back to doing their own illegal wiring. I‚Äôm sure a licensed electrician is going to risk their safety & electrical ticket to do that. If you‚Äôre so keen, it‚Äôs 3 wires mate. You take the liability when someone gets electrocuted.
55. That would be gold üòÇ
56. Could could introduce inclusive zoning that requires a percentage of affordable, public or social housing in new developments. Instead most of their approvals are luxury inner city apartments.
57. It's not a wrong statement objectively, but subjectively - he's trying to shift the narrative away from the fact that he in fact cut power from these people in this instance. Bold move to also do it during election week because he knows not much can be done with immediacy.
58. There are homes. They are either under- utilised or intentionally left empty for whatever reasons. Edit:to correct spelling
59. Housing is a state and federal govt issue‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs ridiculous how little support local councils are getting from state/federal leadership that we are now normalising people living in parks
60. Better tear down the playgrounds too, I know those kids ain‚Äôt paying any rates
61. I acknowledge and understand the issues you raise‚Ä¶. Still stand by my statement that parks are for the people to enjoy not setup shop and call home.
62. Your comment is confusing and doesn‚Äôt help.
63. Link? Edit: No link, only downvote LMAO.
64. I don't pay rates as a renter but I reckon lnp would hate renters
65. Schrinner thinks Bicycle users are all greens mouth pieces: [Brisbane cyclists labelled a ‚ÄòGreens mouthpiece‚Äô by Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner address City Hall : r/brisbane (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/1f89u1n/brisbane_cyclists_labelled_a_greens_mouthpiece_by/)
66. If they didn't care about cyclist safety they wouldn't have spent all that money on top-of-the-line green safety paint which is haphazardly and disjointedly dispersed in 5m segments throughout the city.
67. LNP are planning to rip up half the cycle lanes and routes in the cbd
68. > So figure out what they need and give it to them. * A home * gainful employment * effective mental health treatment * effective substance abuse treatment Council does not deal with any of the above issues, and the last two.. I'm not sure it exists.
69. Saying that building housing will be a disaster is certainly a take.
70. In my experience working in this area, developers get applications approved for x high. 4 years late, no construction has started but demand is now even higher, so they either sell up for huge profits despite building nothing, or they put in a new application for an even taller building on the same site. If Council pushes back then they take Council to court and whoever has the most money (the developer) will get their way. Private-developers are greedy bastards and they will never bring house prices down.
71. You politics fan boys are fucking embarrassing. When did this American worship of political parties become a thing? I realise it's only a thing on Reddit, and not in real Brisbane, but still, this sub is absolutely cooked with you lot
72. More like the shit stuck in the bottom of a hotel drain, needed to be plumbed into the fuckin' sewer.
73. That's very close to Scott Morrison's brand of happy clappy prosperity theology. >This is the view that belief in God leads to material wealth. Salvation too has a connection to material wealth ‚Äì ‚ÄúJesus saves those who save‚Äù. So the godly become wealthy and the wealthy are godly. And, unfortunately, the ungodly become poor and the poor are ungodly. >This theology aligns perfectly with the neo-liberal economic views espoused by Morrison. The consequence is that it becomes a God-given task to liberate people from reliance on the welfare state. >So there is no sense in Pentecostal economics of a Jesus Christ who was on the side of the poor and the oppressed. Nor is there one of rich men finding it easier to pass through the eyes of needles than to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. On the contrary, God helps those who are able to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps.[](https://images.theconversation.com/files/275799/original/file-20190522-187147-8mcbf2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1000&fit=clip) [https://theconversation.com/five-aspects-of-pentecostalism-that-shed-light-on-scott-morrisons-politics-117511](https://theconversation.com/five-aspects-of-pentecostalism-that-shed-light-on-scott-morrisons-politics-117511)
74. If people continue to damage something that is provided for free, and then create danger for others, something has to be done. You can't just let that cycle go on forever.
75. Exactly, the damage to the park infrastructure is a legitimate concern. The issue is how the council approached the situation. They just disabled the power without warning, which not only affected the homeless but also the various charity organisations that turn up daily to provide food and support. This is a reactionary response by council, and will not resolve the problem.
76. https://www.reddit.com/r/AusFinance/s/uPAiannobl Note where the slope changed.
77. 1999, when CGT was discounted, marks the start of the housing crisis.
78. Kicking vulnerable people while they are down should not be tolerated by anyone but here you are talking about dirty bbqs
79. The social contract is precisely looking out for people who are at their lowest, not "I'm alright, so suffer in yr jocks." Homelessness at the rate we are currently seeing is shocking and without a doubt requires a greater response at council and state level. But it also requires a social response- it should shame all of us that we've got this problem. We should be looking for anything we can do to help out.
80. Maybe you could have some empathy. The council makes it hard for homeless people. There‚Äôs little or no rubbish collection services. Shower and laundry facilities are provided 2-3 times a week by a non-government agency (Orange Cloud?). I‚Äôm not even sure where the closest toilets are to these parks. The homeless need support, not derision or apathy. Also I doubt very much that the council have received hundreds of complaints regarding bad behaviour about the homeless living in the tent communities.
81. My impression from that same article was that the BCC permanently disabled the BBQs by opening them up and cutting the cables.
82. When you're homeless and eating or staying warm for the night depends on whether you have access to electricity or not, you might decide to take that risk too I agree the destruction of the park is an issue, but it seems a more obvious solution is to give them access to support so they don't feel the need to do this stuff in the first place. All he's done by disconnecting the power is forcing them to find somewhere else to do the same thing
83. You‚Äôre right. The electrical services available there were inadequate for the number of people there and failed. Instead, the council should supply appropriate services where needed instead of **fucking over people doing it tough already**. The option they picked instead was cruelty + turning a blind eye and hoping it goes away on its own.
84. Utilised by people living in them. Huge demand increase drives up housing prices.
85. That might be, I don‚Äôt know the numbers. But cutting off power and way to cook food is helping anybody how?
86. Typical person thinking in systems with not a shred of empathy. Yes it is a state and federal govt. issue, but it's also a humanitarian issue is it not? Okay - so council is getting little support, state and federal govt might not also be assisting much as it's election time. But do you think cutting their power was a good move from a humanitarian point of view? If someone you know was homeless in a park near you, and asked you for help; would you say 'Nah mate, that's a state and federal govt issue, sorry can't help'? Fuck you to assume that we're normalising people living in parks. You don't assume that for me. It's a state of crisis and a lot of smaller community groups are rallying to help in any way they can at their appropriate level. But this numpty Schrinner just made a dick move - and there's not much to be argued that can support his actions.
87. The federals could make housing affordable today and it would be political suicide because it would mean the end of everyone's gravy train. You know this. Nobody gives a fuck about anyone in this country anymore and the least the coucils could do is keep power running for people who we've all turned our backs on because newsflash... NOBODY WANTS TO BE FUCKING HOMELESS. Dumb cunt.
88. And the dog parks, they're never going to grow up and pay rates
89. You‚Äôre right. In normal times parks ARE for social interaction and enjoyment. But these AREN‚ÄôT ordinary times. Same thing during natural disasters. Different levels would work together and coordinate with community groups. This is a MAN-MADE disaster. Let‚Äôs work together and solve the problem. We‚Äôve got the space, all we need are decent temporary shelter, we‚Äôll maintained and supported with appropriate facilities nearby and support services for the people. We can do it. We just lack leadership from all levels of government.
90. Common. Some people are incapable of pulling their heads out of their asses. So much so that evidence is lacking and emotional downvoting shows the emotional intelligence of a pair of rocks. Come at me stupid downvoters.
91. Yeah and they are all conveniently placed to ensure cyclists are moved out of the way of cars. The green paint is just an extension of car infrastructure, there solely to ensure cars still have priority. Very few instances of it are actually good for cyclists :(
92. Do you have a source for this? I like our bikeways... :(
93. Correct. I'm not suggesting giving away houses obviously, I'm talking about the need to have access to electricity which the council absolutely can arrange.
94. I'm talking in terms of lack of parking, public transport, amenities, houses being too close together etc. The usual issues with high density living we're starting to see everywhere.
95. Also in the industry dealing with councils and developers and absolutely no love for developers but my experience is large expense and significant delay is endured to achieve approval (usually the developer wants more, council wants less, depending on site they meet somewhere in the middle or more often than not council stands firm). I'm not crying rivers of tears for the developers but usually they just want to get the project approved so they can sell the lots or start building and free up capital for their next project.
96. Did you mean to reply to me or are you lost?
97. As I mentioned, you dont have to, but the response to cut electricity without a transitional plan for support in place shows the natural callous disregard for these peoples safety and wellbeing. I really hope you never become homeless, because you might end up like one of these people. And leopards will have eaten your face for agreeing with something that bites you in the ass later.
98. so how on earth does that relate to the Brisbane City Council ..... refer my previous post to you !!
99. surely these campers can live in a civilized way without being total grubs !! These grubs are bring the whole area and their decent campers into a state that would and is intolerable to live in.
100. It‚Äôs not the vandalism that is the problem, they‚Äôve been doing dangerous unlicensed electrical work.
101. Yes, because it‚Äôs a park. Not a homeless shelter. Nor should it be one. The homeless need support, we probably have very different ideas as to what that looks like. My definition does not extend to turning local parks into semi permanent homeless encampments.
102. I certainly do have empathy for those that are doing it tough and looking after themselves. There really is no excuse to vandalize and destroy public property. One also has to discover why they are homeless ? I have spoken to several, some sad tales for sure but others have chosen that path.
103. yes i am sure they had to open the ones the were not already opened, a different photo shows a cut cable with red tape, i doubt people put the power board to charge phones after the power was cut, so they had already broken the door/lock to get inside
104. Agreed, but housing is a state government issue, compounded by federal government importing a few hundred thousand people in the middle of a housing shortage. Council is bound by the local government act 2009, they can‚Äôt solve these issues. They are massive macro level problems, excluding dictatorships that have ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù the people, has any country, anywhere actually solved them? Council is the lowest level of government. If you need zoning permits, You‚Äôve come to the right place. If you want to solve mental health, generational trauma, addictions housing affordability, etc. they can‚Äôt do that. What they can do is represent the views of ratepayers, protect council assets, maintain the social contract and uphold the common law property rights that are a pillar of civilisation. You may not personally want the power shut off, but musgrave park is genuinely a dangerous shitshow that causes grief to the people in the surrounding areas. If council ignores the rate payers (noting, homeless people can vote but rarely do), you erode the social contract. They pay rates to have nice facilities, not to have constant drug use, violence, etc in their local park.
105. It‚Äôs a park paid for by rate payers who do not want to live next to a permanent homeless encampment with all the associated issues that brings. It‚Äôs both not the role of council to do this and a sure fire way for any councillor who supports it in their own division to lose at the next election. It‚Äôs a representative democracy. Councillors represent the views of the voters and rate payers in their division. It‚Äôs been clear for years voters do not want these camps.
106. I‚Äôve just corrected a mis-spelling to make it read ‚Äòunder-utilised‚Äô
107. Yes I absolutely think cutting power off is the correct move. Did you miss the tent fire last week in musgrave park at the homeless encampment. There would be minimal power outlets but probably a long ass extension cord with power banks and the like all daisy chained which is a huge fire risk.
108. You can literally just go to the sub and list by top rated posts this week. It‚Äôs not hard.
109. There was a source, but id have to sift for hours through posts like these sorry üòÖ
110. Why do people always list "lack of parking" as their first thing. Like geez, if it makes prices come down or at least stop skyrocketing, thats money in my pocket. Ill tolerate shitty parking lol.
111. Yeah fair enough, that somehow ended on the wrong comment
112. Given the housing crisis, Council efforts to screw people over instead of provide social housing (which is normally a local council responsibility anywhere else) are cruel and unusual. Providing social housing is a local government role in almost every other developed country (ignoring the 200lb Gorilla over the pond).
