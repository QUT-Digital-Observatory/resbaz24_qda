Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. If we took what we should form mining and foreign companies, we could have a substantial sovereign wealth fund to support our economy.
2. Labor literally deregister the CFMEU and long ago brought in anti association laws to stop bikies in Qld. LNP want to lift the ban on developers "donating" to it and local government.
3. The CFMEU were the only union getting meaningful pay and condition improvements through EBA processes and it turned out that the secret ingredient was crime. Everyone else is getting pay increases below the rate of inflation (I.e., an effective pay cut) in exchange for worsening conditions. The only ones screaming about union "corruption" are the wealthy, because the serfs have the temerity to look at this situation and ask how it's fair.
4. So... why are the LNP expanding government powers, particularly where they encroach on minorities, and expanding the departments that will allow them to enforce this? Facism is a far right phenomenon. And the LNP trends further in that direction every day.
5. Famously, no conservative government in the United States has _ever_ shrank government. The idea that conservatives want small government doesn‚Äôt line up with what conservative politicians actually do, when when conservatives do shrink government, it‚Äôs often because they don‚Äôt understand what that part of the government does and then the collapse everything, ie, Argentina. I would be surprised if Australia was any different. Has Liberal ever actually shrunk government? And conservatives don‚Äôt believe in personal rights and such, they believe in _their_ personal rights, as in just theirs, others can get fucked. A fascist government can easily win the support of conservatives by promising the security of their current rights while they go about crushing everyone else. Afterall, Germany‚Äôs non-Jewish wealthy elite did just fine living under the Nazi regime.
6. Which groups do the Greens want to oppress? Remembering that a key part of fascism is oppressing the rights of groups for personal gain?
7. I don‚Äôt read or watch or listen to any ‚ÄúUS media‚Äù but nice try champ. Also republicans want a smaller less intrusive government? Hilarious! Unless you mean ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù as in ‚Äúless actual employees in the public service, with all of their work piled on others who remain or outsourced to consulting firms‚Äù and a good old serve of ‚Äúprivatisation of entire state-run industries‚Äù. And I‚Äôm guessing by ‚Äúless intrusive‚Äù you actually mean ‚Äúless regulation for big business but way way way more intrusive into the personal reproductive rights of women‚Äù.
8. He gave Crimea to putin.
9. You didn't get to my second paragraph. Ah well. Have a good life
10. Covid created a backlog of visas that led to a spike in migration after border restrictions were relaxed, with the majority being temporary visa holders - of course, they were always going to spike post Covid, particularly with returning and new student enrols. However, if you average out the figures from 2020 onwards, temporary migration was ~280k per annum, considerably less than previous years. Prior to Covid, numbers were increasing year on year, with the largest per annum figure of 350k in 2018-2019. Permanent migration between 2021-2023 has been ~75k per annum, which has been considerably less than every previous year since 2012 bar 2019-2021. The largest intake was in 2016-2017 of 106k. So yes the migration numbers during the Coalition years have been considerably higher. I don‚Äôt understand your point about big businesses? Of course you need businesses to support the economy, but you also equally need to support workers too. The two go hand in hand. Australia has some of the most concentrated markets in the world when it comes to media, energy, banking, telecommunications, supermarkets (Colesworth) etc. - there‚Äôs absolutely a reason why inflation in Australia is currently one of the worst in the developed world. You simply cannot let big businesses run wild, as they have no interest in protecting the general population.
11. I don‚Äôt think 1 billion would come close to paying for pumped storage dam.
12. https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/australians-get-benefits-migration-even-doubters lol, xenophobes are always delusional
13. You suffer from simplistic thinking üòú
14. Blanket sentences being indefinite setences absolutely. Courts coming together to place a whole life order on someone after they've been sentenced for those crimes who show no sign of rehabilitation? Absolutely. It happens in the UK, and I think it should be considered here also for extremely dangerous members of society. But I do agree with this, there does need to be a serious overhaul of sentencing etc re those crimes. https://www.aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/tandi628 This is from 2021 Despite a large body of international evidence, Dowling and colleagues‚Äô (forthcoming) review located only three Australian studies (Daly et al. 2013; Goodman-Delahunty & O‚ÄôBrien 2014; Krone & Smith 2017). Goodman-Delahunty and O‚ÄôBrien (2014), following offenders referred to a treatment program for an average of around 10 years (SD=4.5 years), found a general reoffending rate of 32 percent, and a non-sexual reoffending rate of 20 percent. Daly and colleagues (2013), following offenders for an average of around four years, found a notably higher general reoffending rate of 54 percent in their sample of juvenile sexual offenders. Consistent with the rest of the studies in Pooley and Dowling‚Äôs (forthcoming) review, fewer than 10 percent of offenders in both studies sexually reoffended. The only Australian study to date examining reoffending among CSAM offenders specifically (Krone and Smith 2017) reported findings similar to those of international research. Examining reoffending over an average of about 3.5 years, they found that seven percent sexually reoffended, most (5%) with another CSAM offence, although a smaller proportion escalated to contact or grooming sexual offences (1% each). There is a clear need for further rigorous Australian research examining baseline rates of reoffending among child sexual offenders, particularly CSAM offenders, along with its predictors. There is also a lack of research that compares CSAM offenders with contact and procurement/grooming offenders. This research is critical to informing the scale, implementation and targeting of treatment and criminal justice responses to child sexual offenders, particularly those that assume a high degree of persistence in sexual offending, such as sexual offender registers, indeterminate sentencing regimes, and sexual offender-specific treatment. And this is from 2024 but the sample size is small. Those who get treatment are less likely to reoffend then those who don't. Yet still they are saying we need more research to really know. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13552600.2024.2328052#abstract Our findings highlight a need for more Australian and New Zealand research addressing the recidivism rates post-treatment. More specifically, three future research directives are identified: the need for methodologically strong research, identification of recidivism outcomes for Indigenous young people, and the need for qualitative research to explore the profiles of young people who terminate treatment.
15. have you ever heard of rehabilitation? https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-10-05/what-are-nordic-prisons-like-criminal-justice/101481590
16. Passing comment resulting in my question. You know how that works right? Or is comprehension not your thing? Clown shoes. GTFO halfwit
17. Sure you were you Pelican ü§£
18. Ok this is the problem with high inflation, everyone goes backwards. Giving everyone more money is not the answer.
19. > So... why are the LNP expanding government powers, particularly where they encroach on minorities. Point me to the policy that the QLD LNP have that is designed to ‚Äúencroach on minorities‚Äù > Facism is a far right phenomenon. And the LNP trends further in that direction every day. Terrible logic here. Do you know what seperates a right wing government in a democracy and a fascist government? If you are suggesting that the LNP, especially a state branch of the LNP, is somehow trending to try and remove democratic process, then you are dreaming.
20. > Famously, no conservative government in the United States has ever shrank government. That is categorically false. It‚Äôs very common for conservative candidates to campaign for reduced government spending, and the cutting of red tape and regulations for industry. Small government does not actually mean reducing the number of politicians if that‚Äôs what you are getting at. It‚Äôs reducing government influence on society, by cutting what is deemed unnecessary government costs, jobs and rules from society.
21. That‚Äôs actually not true, fascism believes in the rights of individuals coming second to the perceived good of the nation, and often in the process oppressing the rights of minority groups.
22. If you don‚Äôt consume US media then why are your opinions full of their talking points re Trump ü§£ü§°
23. Putin invaded Crimea during Obama‚Äôs second term
24. If we were building houses and extra production capacity while waiting for our immigration backlog, it would have been sensible. The ALP has simply shown themselves not to be sensible. Or, worse, they brought in the mass of immigrants to prop up the economy. They were desperate to have a budget surplus, and they got it, despite Aussies landing up in tents all over the place. The ALP will be punished severely at the next election for this and they richly deserve it.
25. But it's a billion closer to storing all those renewables we've been building. ;) Even subsidising home batteries would have done a lot in the long run. As it stands, we have people spending, me included, more on coffee or other small, short-term purchases.
26. Everyone who thinks immigration is too high, must be a xenophobe. lol
27. Parrot
28. It is when efficiency and profits are also going up. I think you need to look at how shit some EBAs are. There are unions that are only managing to get what amounts to a loss of three percent or more per year in real terms on their pay. Of course, without the union the employer could just reduce everyone to minimum wage, so...
29. They have a weird obsession with winding back LGBTQ rights, they've got candidates who are lifting talking points from Project 2025 around destroying departments (especially the department of education), and they've got the stalking horse KAP willing to aid and abet them in re-criminalising abortion just for a start. Are the LNP facists? Maybe not yet, but they're certainly cribbing from that playbook.
30. It‚Äôs very common for conservative candidates to campaign on those things; very rare for them to actually cut government spending is a significant way.
31. Sure, they campaign on that idea but actually research it. Genuinely, I challenge you to look into the history of laws passed by previous governments to see what they genuinely did versus what they said they would. All parties lie, they all make promises they know they can't make but the truth comes out with what they do when they're in power. If you vote LNP because you genuinely believe they're about cost effencies you've been entirely sold a lie.
32. , Nazis were all about "individualism" and obeying leaders. If it was all about the collective good of the state above the individual then Hitler would view himself as the same importance as the grunts, removed the leadership in the means of production, also the leaders of the nazi leadership wouldn't have fled to the USA and south America when Germany fell.
33. And he was sanctioned and everyone was mad and wanted to retake it and then trump won and lifted all sanctions and told everyone that Crimea belonged to the very impressive putin and to stop complaining about it. And now look where we are. Edit: he's even going to do it again if he wins. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=m6nxJZOZdqE
34. Both major parties are absolutely not serious about housing and it‚Äôs a travesty. I‚Äôm no fan of Labor, but you also have to acknowledge the politics of this as well. They took housing reforms to the 2019 election and lost and the media will continue to crucify them if they don‚Äôt deliver on budget surpluses - damned if you do, damned if you don‚Äôt. Also, this was my original point about neoliberal economics - suppressing wages, eroding workers rights, and propping up businesses interests through immigration is exactly what neoliberalism is all about. The Liberal party on many occasions have explicitly made this their intention.
35. Yeah look I‚Äôm not going to argue online with a union shill that has no idea
36. Thats not what fascism is!!! Fascism is when one person takes power and does not give it up destroying democratic process!! If you don't like those polices, then vote for a different candidate!!
37. I‚Äôm not arguing that governments always keeps promises, I‚Äôm arguing against the ridiculous claim that no conservative US administration has ever shrunk the government, when it‚Äôs quite clear that they do. Shrinking government is things like tax cuts, reduced spending, deregulation but it also includes cutting public services and selling off government assets. Are you seriously going to tell me conservative governments don‚Äôt do that?
38. Except again, that‚Äôs not true. We know what the characteristics of 1940s German Fascism was, and it‚Äôs not how you describe it.
39. Aren't you just proving my point? You are saying the United States should go to war with Russia over a tiny part of the Ukraine, it's absolute madness.
40. Citation.
41. Go and look at the SDA's last "result." A pay cut relative to inflation AND decreased conditions for employees, because it was either that shit deal or a worse result from arbitration.
42. That's because you lost the argument.
43. >union shill Ah, found another who hates people that actually work for a living
44. That's not what facism is. That's a dictatorship. Learn the difference. The basic and most easily accessible explanation of facism is the following. 1. The cult of tradition. ‚ÄúOne has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.‚Äù **The LNP does this. They are conservative and growing more so.** 2. The rejection of modernism. ‚ÄúThe Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense, Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.‚Äù **The LNP does this. Lots of things that are modern, among them abortion, racial equality, and LGBTQI equality are rejected by the LNP.** 3. The cult of action for action‚Äôs sake. ‚ÄúAction being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.‚Äù **The LNP is running on an adult crime, adult time slogan despite all metrics showing a decrease in crime in general and youth crime in particular.** 4. Disagreement is treason. ‚ÄúThe critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture, the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.‚Äù **Arguably not there yet.** 5. Fear of difference. ‚ÄúThe first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.‚Äù **You only need to look at their campaign platform to see this in action.** 6. Appeal to social frustration. ‚Äú\[‚Ä¶\] one of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups. **Again, see their campaign platform.** 7. The obsession with a plot. ‚ÄúThe followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.‚Äù **Stop the boats, if you don't know vote no, adult crime adult time...** 8. The enemy is both weak and strong. ‚Äú\[‚Ä¶\] the followers must be convinced that they can overwhelm the enemies. Thus, by a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.‚Äù **Labor are simultaneously corrupt authoritarian union lackeys who control everything yet somehow are too incompetent to govern.** 9. Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. ‚ÄúFor Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.‚Äù **Not there yet.** 10. Contempt for the weak. ‚ÄúElitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.‚Äù **Definitely a feature of the LNP.** 11. Everybody is educated to become a hero. ‚Äúin Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.‚Äù **Not there yet.** 12. Machismo and Weaponry. ‚ÄúThis is the origin of machismo (which implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality). Since even sex is a difficult game to play, the Ur-Fascist hero tends to play with weapons‚Äîdoing so becomes an ersatz phallic exercise.‚Äù **LNP policy both literal (they want to wind back gun restriction) and figurative (anti-LGBTQI policies are the norm from them).** 13. Selective Populism. ‚ÄúThere is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People. **Have you seen their campaign? Do you read the Courier Mail or Daily Telegraph or watch Nine news? Have you seen Sky News or listened to talk back radio?** 14. Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. ‚ÄúAll the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.‚Äù **See election slogans.** 11/14 features met and they are only accelerating in that direction.
45. to the absolute detriment of society, they do.
46. Again if it was only about oppressing the individual for the importance of the state then all the fascist leaders of history wouldn't be these godlike figures in their history and would be quashed for the collective group since their higher status goes against that. And even your definition doesn't represent the Greens anyway since they don't have a group they want to push above all others considering they are always talking about bringing the rights of everyone up together, can't quash the rights of the individual when your whole mantra is bringing them up with you.
47. No 6 month old account with a word word number username, I'm pointing out that the reason trump doesn't want war is because he is a different kind of immoral to the type everyone is used to.
48. Heh ok buddy
49. you really went to chat GPT and asked, "what is fascism" lol.
50. I never said it was the *only* characteristic of fascism. It‚Äôs just one of them, the others being Autocracy, and totalitarianism. Both which require a single unchallenged leader. Even if your reasoning was correct, there is nothing to say that a fascist leader would have rules for thee but not for me, meaning that while he wanted the states wellbeing to take precedence for the rest of the country, by nature of his position, he would still enjoy the privilege of individualism.
51. He is just so immoral that he doesn‚Äôt want hundreds of thousands of people to die. What a monster
52. You don't know what the difference between a dictatorship and facism is and you don't recognise the most famous work on facism in Umberto Eco's writing. Either you are not a serious person and are arguing in bad faith, or you are outright an LNP shill.
53. Again since when do The Greens have some kind of autocratic leader or police state policy. Your own definition doesn't even match The Greens at all. They don't push for some kind of military force or surveillance of your description, nor do they have some kind of unchallenged figurehead. They push for more foreign aid to other countries, how is that helping the "state collective above all else"
54. He is so immoral he wants putin to take Ukraine and then more of Europe too, yes, he's a monster. He doesn't care about people's lives at all, he would happily go to war to get what he wants, he's stirring up a civil war right now.
55. > You don‚Äôt know what the difference between a dictatorship and facism is and you don‚Äôt recognise the most famous work on facism in Umberto Eco‚Äôs writing. Eco defined Fascism as a symbol that has an infinite number of interpretations. So Eco‚Äôs writing on Fascism is useless. You are saying that because the LNP is conservative, and fascism is accounted with right wing politics, that the LNP is in fact, a fascist organisation. But clearly, this is not the case, because virtually all democracy‚Äôs have right wing parties and governments yet they are not fascist. Fascism is characterised by authoritarianism, and dictatorship. There is a difference between dictatorship and fascism, because they are 2 seperate descriptions of political phenomena. But they always go hand in hand. Fascism is authoritarianism, fascism is Autocracy. Unless you can prove that the LNP in this state election is seriously attempting to remove democratic due process by forcibly removing opposition, then the LNP is not fascist, and is simply right wing. And no I‚Äôm not an LNP shill, I literally voted labour today. But that doesn‚Äôt make your argument any less stupid.
56. > Again since when do The Greens have some kind of autocratic leader or police state policy. Your own definition doesn‚Äôt even match The Greens at all. I never said the greens had autocratic leader policies, I was responding to someone who said that there are probably some extremists LNP members who would push trump lite agendas, which is referring to the allegations, at least according to some, that trump is a fascist who wants to destroy American democracy by making himself a dictator. I replied with a comment that there are probably greens members who would love the idea of a forever far left government. This isn‚Äôt as far fetched as you think, there are lots of insinuations made to the idea of a revolution made by your average green type voters at every single indigenous rights protest. You know what a revolution is right? > They don‚Äôt push for some kind of military force or surveillance of your description, nor do they have some kind of unchallenged figurehead. They push for more foreign aid to other countries, how is that helping the ‚Äústate collective above all else‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt accusing the hypothetical greens members of fascism, because that wouldn‚Äôt make sense. You don‚Äôt have to be fascist and right wing to be authoritarian and autocratic. In fact, the extreme left and extreme right share many characteristics with each other.
57. I am saying that the LNP's current platforms lean heavily into facistic territory and do so increasingly year to year. Are the facists yet? Maybe, maybe not. Are they headed that way? Absolutely. And you are still wrong about what facism is. Learn about it first before you try to lecture people on it. Facism is an actual, discrete thing.
58. In some ways the far right and left do have parallels but then again so do centrist/moderates have similarities to the far right and far left. It's doesn't really mean anything
59. Until the LNP start making moves to end democratic process in Australia, they are not fascist, only conservative.
60. But it does mean something. If you love political freedom, then you would detest both an extreme left or right government. Communist China has no problem with rounding up political opponents and sending them to reeducation camps, neither did nazi Germany. Our democratic system, while not perfect is pretty damn good, and people who cannot see that are way to politically inclined to one end of the spectrum.
61. if elected, they're going to introduce an election process which makes it harder for every other party to get in government, thus, concreting their stranglehold of governance. thats straight out of the fascist playbook.
62. Israel has been jailing journalists on mass lately, the USA has the highest population of prisoners on the planet, and Australia locks up whistleblowers for 5 years for acting in the public interest. At least in China you get an extremely fast rail and affordable housing out of its paranoia, our current generation live in tents.
63. Oh so your a tankie, lol.
64. tankie is such a old man thing to say, its not 1960 anymore grandpa that was 60 years ago and the soviet union changed management over 30 years ago
65. Anyone voting for LNP needs to fuck off from the state.
66. Knowing he ingested all that lead from Mt Isa explains a fair bit.
67. what infrastructure
68. The public service needs a reform.. Labor is gone, time to sort out
69. Turns out vitriol and smartarse memes on reddit don't affect voters.
70. Unfortunatley the brain cells start to dry up past bundaberg. Maybe thats being too generous. QLD would be better off splitting into two states. That way you could let the idiots fend for themselves. Im sure they would probably prefer it that way tbh.
71. Not your state mate.
72. oh no
73. Nice childish take.
74. Rough night aye mate lol
75. Cope > seethe
76. Less efficient, more expensive and irredeemably privatised It's the liberal way.
77. Do you mean you want it gutted and sold to private offshore non australian entities and LNP buddies so that all queenslanders can enjoy the benifits of whats left of all their services sky rocketing in prices?
78. You‚Äôve just outed yourself as the idiot mate. Look how many seats around Brisbane went LNP.
79. I live in Keppel and voted for Brittany. Rocky has historically always been Labor until just recently. That change has nothing to do with us, it's to do with wealthy retirees coming up from down south. Fling shit in that direction, mate.
80. weirdos like you can enjoy 4 years of crime and rising prices
81. [removed]
82. I think your wrong LNP just announced there would be culling in the Public Sector‚Ä¶ so much for for bullshit Labor spin
83. Get off the meth champ, and have a sit down
84. I don‚Äôt live in QLD, so I get to laugh at you with no consequences either way. Your complete anguish after weeks of foaming mouth obsessing is just so god damn satisfying.
85. This just in: litifeta thinks the majority of QLD voters are pedophiles. Makes me think someone should check your hard drive bro Edit: oh man look at your activity, feverishly posting about Labour and Harris. This is gonna be a bad few weeks for you lol
86. minds as bright as a dark room LNP supporters have "anyone who disagrees with me does meth," maybe put down your bottle, mate.
87. It's probably projection. This fuckwit is going around accusing everyone of being on meth.
