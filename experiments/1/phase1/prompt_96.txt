Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. The LNP released their policies and "costings" this arvo. Adopting new policies two days before the election would be nonsensical for Labor. I'm stating fact, * Labor built seven satellite hospitals since 2023 * Labor have proposed another seven satellite hospitals * They can be built * They can be funded * The LNP have chosen not to commit to the projects You interpretated that as a negative for the LNP, which is your prerogative.
2. I don't understand how this is hard to understand for these people lmao
3. Can’t wait for BERT Summer 😍 24.4 bendy girl ⚡️
4. Massive missed opportunity to call it the River City Rollers
5. Ibus/Ibis. With a bin chicken logo
6. SUUUUURELY we find a way to name it BORT?
7. As much as the 'Metro' gets memed, I don't think anyone really has an issue with the idea of using the busways for high-capacity, regular interval transport. In fact its pretty great. But a metro it aint. BERT is a winner. It's funny, its lighthearted, it's a million times better than the GLink.
8. Brisbane Light Urban Expressway for You (BLUEY)
9. I said it before previously, but I really like the idea of calling the 'Metro' lines B:Link just like Gold Coast's G:Link. They would be somewhat fundamentally similar networks (tram bodies running on their own right of ways with similar-ish capacity) so I think it would fit quite well.
10. Agree, and we need ERNIE too.😂 "Metro" specifically refers to trains anywhere else in the world so yes embarassing. Confusing for tourists? You bet your Albert Street Station
11. Great, and let's rename the existing trains to: Electrified Rail Network - Intercity Express BERT and ERNIE
12. ASVPB - Adrian Schrinner Vanity Project Bus
13. ![gif](giphy|LoGh1t5iGxFOE) Bert you say
14. I propose BIATCH - brisbane integrated advanced transit commuter hub. It just slips off the tongue so nicely.
15. "Bert, feed me!"
16. Well I'm glad he's not obsessed, obsessions are unhealthy.
17. Isn't it just an oversized articulated (accordion) bus? ... or "tram on (tire) wheels"
18. BERT, FEED ME.
19. Bertie McBertface
20. It’s not a transport system. It’s just a special vehicle type that uses the busway network. Even with the metro upgrades, the busway is still the busway. Call the vehicles the Bertie Buses or the Bluey Buses, but let’s not pretend this is actually a complete transport system unto itself that requires its own name distinct from the busway.
21. Would everyone actually have preferred the entire busway to be shut down for years and converted to rail? Why does it matter if it’s on a rail or wheels if it gets you from point A to B? I don’t get it…
22. "My bones are so brittle! But i always drink plenty of... Malk?"
23. Or, hear me out, A Bus, or if you really care An Electric Bus
24. Agree, Ax the metro title!
25. BORT - Brisbane Omnibus Rapid Transit
26. Get on the BERT
27. There is very little that’s rapid about busses.
28. ERNIE - Electric Railless Network Interconnecting Everything
29. Only if it can be followed by the Eastern Region New Independent Electrics (ERNIE). It’d have to be a separate system of course, but it could work and run all the way up to the Sunshine Coast and down to the Gold Coast.
30. YES! My campaign is gathering pace! https://i.redd.it/3u4iij5ugnwd1.gif
31. Why not the CityDog in honour of the CityCat? Then that means we can rename Cross River Rail the CityRat or CityMole.
32. SBB. Schrineer's bendy bus is what I call it.
33. Has anyone said SQRT? (Pronounced squirt)
34. Ibus to reference Brisbane's iconic bird (ibis)
35. I've previously suggested the Brisbane Infrastructure Transport Connection Hub, but BERT does have a nicer ring to it to be honest.
36. Bussy McBusface
37. The next Olympic city, who has also done the Olympics in 1984, Los Angeles calls EVERYTHING Metro. Bus, light rail, subway. ALL OF IT. The name of the organization is literally metro https://www.metro.net Not to mention the G-line, which is lettered and mapped on with all the rail lines is a much shittier BRT Brisbane doesn’t have a tough act to follow
38. >"Brisbane should save the Metro title for the underground rail subway system that will eventually be completed." This is such a fundamental misunderstanding of Brisbane's transport network. Brisbane is not getting an underground rail subway system. There has never been any real proposals for an underground subway system, and Cross River Rail is not an underground subway system. It always bemuses me at how many people think that CRR will be this rapid transit like, flashy metro/subway network (like the Sydney Metro). All cross river rail is, is an additional river crossing which will carry the same QR narrow gauge lines that the current network uses under the river instead of over it via the Merivale Bridge. That's it. It's not a new system, it's not a subway. It won't ever be a system, as it's not designed for expansion. It's literally a tunnel that will carry existing lines from one side of the existing QR narrow gauge network to the other. It won't even get designated as a new line, as it's not it's own line, it's just a stretch of track. Yes it will have stations on it, and the stations might look like rapid transit\\metro stations, but ultimately they are still just heavy rail stations. Brisbane metro on the other hand, is not a true metro either, but that's a whole other can of worms.
39. Do they have dedicated lanes for the entire length?
40. Well San Francisco already has BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) so why not BURP… Brisbane Urban Rapid People-mover or BUMT…Brisbane Urban Metro Transit Our possibilities are immense…
41. How about ELMO
42. We need more BERT license plates!
43. Berty McBertface
44. I will never not call it the suss bus
45. Keep it BERT but implement a Electric Renewable Network Integrated Express
46. Nobody cares about the name. Just move on
47. STUBI (Stupid Bi-articulated bus)
48. I wouldn’t consider Melbournes rails network a genuine ‘Metro’ network…
49. Shut up about what it's called
50. The name is fine, and doesn’t matter as much as people here think.
51. Does the name really matter so consequentially that it is worth the cost to switch names over (even if it is only a few millions dollars)? Does it run on tracks? No. Does it have a completely dedicated piece of infrastructure? Yes. Does it transport much more people than a bus? Yes. Does it run frequently on dedicated routes? Yes. Is it underground? No. It really seems like the argument for a name change boils down to semantics. So many people are imagining 'horrified tourists' arriving en masse for the Olympics to catch the metro and having a heart attack when "my god... it-... it-... it doesn't even run on tracks". As if the existence of tracks automatically signifies a modern and high quality public transport system? And what do you think will happen when someone talks about the BERT? A tourist struggling with finding their way around the city asks a local "excuse me, how can I get to South Bank" and the local responds "oh sure you just catch the BERT". They are more likely to wonder if they missed something in English class than think "oh they must mean catch that gigantic bus that looks like a tram with wheel covers over there". It seems from what I can tell that the primary point of OP is that if it isn't underground it shouldn't be called a metro (especially by trying to draw a comparison to Melbourne). At this point you have to wonder if people get really confused when they eventually catch the Bankstown metro line from the Western suburbs of Sydney and think "but it isn't underground... this mustn't be the metro". Perhaps something like 'M-Bus' catches the pure semantic meaning of the service in the same way that the 'S-Bahn' does the job of explaining it clearly in Germany. It isn't really catchy though and I don't think we quite aspire for the German's love for efficiency, so I still in my mind can't really justify millions of dollars to change the name and advertise the name change to confused people who could have sworn that "there used to be a bus called a metro here, but now I only see M-Bus on the journey planner". At the end of the day a name change has to be so beneficial to overcome the many consequences of changing a name, and I don't think there is really enough of a benefit here to justify it.
52. I'd put money on us Brisbanites whingeing and whining when we cop international flack during the olympics about the naming of these buses, while also defending the name choice. It's like naming a train "automobile". It's just confusing and dumb.
53. Who cares? ... clearly some of you. Adelaide and Auckland call their entire bus networks the Metro. Paris has a monorail called a Metro. We are using it to distinguish between buses on non-dedicated roads, a full EV, and biarticlated vehicles. For now, Metro will do. Let's get it going to more places.
54. [deleted]
55. Having a Menty Bert. 🤪
56. When I ride the BERT I wanna hear those BERT classics
57. The second best time is now.
58. Brisbane City Rollers?
59. Inner Brisbane Interval Service
60. Can this topic be a part of a utopia episode? If it already is, I’m going to watch the whole series
61. This is the only other name I would want for it. Any replacement name has to be short.
62. Underrated
63. I've said this since it was first announced. A missed opportunity.
64. Feels like a throwback to 2006 when everything was getting called i-something. Remember iVegemite? I don't want to.
65. Yeah, but the necessary license plates are unavailable
66. My public transport project is also called BORT
67. Brisbane Ordinary Rapid Transit.
68. >BERT is a winner. It's funny, its lighthearted, it's a million times better than the GLink. GLink does sound way too corporate, something straight out of Utopia.
69. I think this is the only real issue, that it simply is not a metro by any stretch of the imagination. Why don't we rename central station to Brisbane Airport? It's just like planes but instead of having them fly through the air with jet engines we give them metal wheels and put them on rails!
70. Nice, but only if the entire busway is illuminated with low-level lighting.
71. Honestly wouldn’t be mad if it caught on. “I’ll catch the Bluey to Cultural Centre”. Doesn’t have to be an acronym, could just be a cool name.
72. But they're not express
73. It was a Graham Quirk vanity project.
74. Would mean we need an Ernie too
75. Up you go!
76. I cannot think of an acronym for ERNIE. Bert will forever be without his lifelong friend.
77. Would be perfect, but what is advanced?
78. But his name was Berk.
79. Well we already have unique names for different levels of the bus services: * Rockets * Bullets * BUZ * CityGlider * City Express What's wrong with one more name for a different level of service. That being said I don't really like the name Metro or Bert. Like who is going to say: "just hop on the bert", "I caught the bert", "I love the bert".
80. Everyone just mad about the naming. The solution is actually a pretty smart use of existing infrastructure
81. The actual solution being delivered is not on the same level as a true metro project, so naming it one is misleading. A metro generally consists of high capacity trains running on their own dedicated rights of way at very high frequencies (every few minutes during peak times). The Brisbane Metro misses the mark on all of these, except for maybe frequencies, although this will still be at the lower end compared to most metro systems. Many of the benefits of the Brisbane Metro could have been achieved through a cheaper bus network review, similar to the one abandoned in 2014.
82. Rather than that, would have been nice if the busway starting in eight mile plains was upgraded to trams, then each station up the line to the city was subsequently shut down and refitted. That way people who live on the busway can still travel one of two directions while the works are ongoing without transfers, and when it’s their turn for upgrades it’ll be much shorter than waiting for the whole busway to be upgraded. But yes I would have rathered rails. Electrified so they don’t need to run on expensive batteries, and can be fully automated in a way smart driving busses just won’t be for many many years. And when you have a line that’s powered indefinitely by connection and doesn’t need a driver, it can run 24 hours at low cost and high frequency and on public holidays. This is something big fancy busses can’t do, but trams could.
83. My son is also named Bert
84. My bus is also named Bort.
85. ERNIE is on board. >It’d have to be a separate system of course, but it could work and run all the way up to the Sunshine Coast and down to the Gold Coast. Anything but East / West, that is never needed... just multiple parallel lines with the coast please.
86. I don’t think the OP or others are saying CRR will be a metro/subway system. They’re referring to a brand new line that whilst not officially proposed, has been widely discussed to run from Brisbane’s western suburbs to the north-east via West End, CBD, Bulimba, Hamilton, etc.
87. I don't think there is any widespread belief that cross river rail is anything other than more tracks on our existing rail network, they just happen to be underground. Also, there was a plan for a Brisbane subway which was a genuine metro line included in the connecting SEQ 2031 plan. It just never progressed, but it gets occasional airtime in the media (i saw an article maybe a month or so back). That's what people are hoping to one day call the Brisbane metro
88. >There has never been any real proposals for an underground subway system There was in the 1950s. There are plans from that time floating around somewhere online and will try to find them. Brisbane Subway between Toowong and Bowen Hills was also part of the Connecting SEQ 2031 plan.

89. No Australian city has a true metro. A true metro is a fixed guideway system that exists somewhere between suburban rail and light rail. Compared to suburban rail, speeds are slower, stations are closer together, and the system is intentionally designed for anywhere to anywhere journeys (as opposed to journeys to / thru central). They are typically entirely separate from both the road network and the regional / freight network. Melbourne's "metro" is a tart up of the legacy suburban rail system. It has fewer level crossings than it did, but isn't entirely separate. It has dedicated regional / freight tracks on some routes but not out through Pakenham. Changes are proposed, but every train still starts and ends at Flinders St. Adelaide's metro is just the public transport system, ie buses, guided buses, trams and suburban trains. Even Sydney metro is very far from a true metro. It exists separate to the suburban rail system, but it features larger, more widely spaced stations, trains that run a similar timetable to the legacy suburban rail lines (but at a higher speed), and routes connecting outlying suburbs to Central. It's more suburban rail (and less metro) than the legacy Sydney trains. I think that, at this point, the word Metro has no meaning in the Australian context.
90. No, they are just new, longer buses using the same busways as all other buses
91. the metro route is dedicated to public transport only for the entire length
92. It is about 99% dedicated lanes. There are 3 sets of lights between South Bank and King George Square stations where metros might wait for pedestrians to cross (and I think one of the set of lights might still be a car crossing). But for every other section it is bus/metro only.
93. >Our possibilities are immense… And it eventuated as Metro?
94. The "metros" are about teice the capacity of a regular rigid bus and about half a 3 car train, or less than 2/3 of a G-link tram. They will only run at 15 min frequencues off peak. And have several grade crossing points. I mean at this point it has about as much in common with a 3-car inter city exoress train as it does a Metro.
95. >I'd put money on us Brisbanites whingeing and whining when we cop international flack during the olympics about the naming of these buses, while also defending the name choice. We're a stupid bunch. Congrats on being first one here to whinge and whine without any useful insights to contribute. Do you like the Metro branding?
96. Who is Adelaide?
97. What is Electric Rapid Transit? A bus rapid transit system. Which is electric. Y'know, exactly what this type of system is?
98. Someone said the other day they should be called 'City Dogs' and I thought that was cute.
99. do you also think the "rocket" "bullet" or "glider" busses are misleading? just wait till you hear about the adelaide metro, or the dozens of other cities that call their bus metro
100. I support this.
101. Potato Potato
102. Electric Rail NOT, that is.
103. >what is advanced? The marketing
104. BCC is just bad at naming these things. You’re right that it’s a level of service, but that still isn’t a transport system. As a user I don’t really care what vehicle it is taking me on the 169 route, I care about frequency and the stops it services. At best, distinguishing Metro 169 from regular bus 169 makes no difference in getting from point A to point B, at worst it creates confusion (particularly for anyone unfamiliar with the nuances of Brisbane transport). Metro is the worst of the names because it actively implies something it is not. The rest are simply not descriptive enough to be intuitive and, arguably, overlap considerably from a functional point-of-view.
105. Bullets aren't a thing, are they? Great Circle Line is another branding name missing. But also, I'd say we already have too many names which would confuse people new to the city. Should be maybe BUZ, and Rocket, that's enough
106. Yeah. BERT sounds like someone tried to come up with a good name and failed. It needs to be either a spectacular name, or it needs to be just a little bit frivolous. I suggest the Bananananana bus.
107. apart from the whole Cultural Centre debacle
108. i find it funny that everyone is worried about being "embarrassed" about calling it a metro but oblivious to the irony of being so whingey and whiney about being outraged by the name, the least important part of any project. its far more embarrassing how much everyone is spitting the dummy over what is otherwise a great improvement to our public transport
109. these are high-capacity busses running on dedicated busways at very high frequencies. people are really mad at a name, literally the least important part of any project literally the only difference is the name, everything else (including function) is identical do you also think the "rocket" "bullet" or "glider" busses are "misleading"? ETA: based on the BCC renders, the new Metro route will only have 1 at-grade crossing with pedestrians / traffic
110. Yes, thank you. I did consider including that in the post but many of the search results into that lead back to "[Brisbane Metro](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/traffic-and-transport/public-transport/brisbane-metro)". The Brisbane Subway in the [Detailed Network Strategies for 2031](https://cabinet.qld.gov.au/documents/2010/jul/connecting%20seq%202031/Attachments/4%20-%20connectingseqweb04partc.pdf): >**Brisbane subway** >Toowong to Newstead (first section) providing a high capacity, high-frequency, distributor system connecting central Brisbane destinations and distributing passengers from the bus and rail network across the intensely developed core of inner Brisbane. >**New Brisbane subway** >By 2031 there will be 2.4 million trips per day in inner Brisbane (within about five kilometres from the CBD), up from about one million in 2006. A subway system for Brisbane will support the expected growth and expansion of the inner city. >This will be a new separate network, with separate operations to existing rail infrastructure. The London underground and New York subway are well known examples of this style of rail operation. >The Brisbane subway will provide a high-capacity, high-frequency distributor system connecting central city destinations and linking passengers from the bus and rail networks to destinations not within a comfortable walk of existing stations. >The priority corridor for delivery by 2031 will be from Toowong to West End to Bowen Hills/Newstead. This corridor would be under the CBD and intersect with existing rail and busway stations. Longer-term opportunities to expand the Brisbane subway could include: >• Bowen Hills/Newstead to Airport Village via Hamilton North Shore >• Newstead to Bulimba >• potential conversion of some sections of Brisbane’s busway network to increase public transport capacity. I don't know how widely discussed it is, as didn't hear shit about it during current QLD election if it is considered for delivery by 2031.
111. Sydney Metro is definitely a "metro" in the way most people think of metro systems. It's just a very, very strange use case for one.
112. Yup sure did 🤪
113. Sure you are pointing out some interesting facts for public transport enthusiasts like you or me, but I don't think we need to draw the public into a wider "is it a 3-car inner-city express, a metro, a bus or a trackless tram" sort of debate. Ultimately we are still talking semantics here: it is frequent (even in off-peak if you are at an inner-city station you will see one every 7.5 minutes or so), it is dedicated infrastructure (mostly, with slight asterisks as you point out) and it is higher capacity (only 2/3 of a tram, but still large). I don't think either a local or a tourist is going to mind if it went underground or goes on tracks, as long as those above 3 criteria are ticked when they hear the word "metro". Therefore, what reason are we changing the name for? I agree "metro" isn't correct, but it isn't so offensively wrong that we should take money away from something more important just to change it in my view.
114. No I don't, for the same reason OP doesn't. It's not a metro.
115. When is Adelaide?
116. That's because rockets/bullets/gliders aren't already names used for transportation infrastructure in cities. The word 'metro' absolutely implies something that this isn't, as would words like 'airport', 'tram', 'train'. rocket/bullet/glider don't have that vibe at all. In fact, for all three of these words, there are additional usages and connotations which separate them from their usages as physical objects. For example, 'to rocket' is a verb meaning to move quickly. Wouldn't you know, busses described as 'rockets' are usually express versions! It's almost like they're busses that are moving quickly! 'Glider' is commonly used to describe someone/something who moves smoothly and effortlessly - in this case used to describe a bus. This is also in the name 'city glider' - a bus that moves through the city smoothly and effortlessly. 'Bullet' also generally means to move quickly and is often used in the figurative sense 'as fast as a bullet'. 'Bullet trains' aren't called bullet trains because they are literally bullets - it's because they move quickly. Metro can't be used in any similar way.
117. I'm new here, what was the Cultural Centre debacle?
118. > dedicated busways Are they? Or do they share with other traffic/pedestrians, like around the Cultural Centre/QPAC region?
119. "Very high frequencies" of 15 minutes. Head back to yank land please.
120. Function is not identical. The capacity of these buses is at most 170. Compare this to Sydney Metro with a capacity of 1,100 per train. The Brisbane version is nowhere near the capacity of a metro. The buses will run on busways, yes. But they share these with other bus routes and share at grade intersections with general traffic. This is not true of a metro. No, I don’t really take issue with the other names because they’re not commonly used transit terms and aren’t being marketed as a new system/network.
121. Sadly, I don’t think it’s on the cards anymore, and definitely not for delivery by 2031.
122. Holy fuck I just read your comment again hahaha haha WHAT metro can’t be used in any other way?!?!? Are you aware of the word metropolitan?

125. Pretty much the biggest benefit, and main goal of this whole project was to eliminate the bottleneck at the Cultural Centre which is a massive chokepoint and strangles the entire busway network. The original proposal would have seen an upgrade to the Cultural Centre, including a tunnel underneath Melbourne Street and new underground platforms for the metro vehicles, eliminating the 90 right hand turn at the end of the current Busway Tunnel, and two at-grade intersections on Melbourne Street itself. For a myriad of reasons, this was scaled back massively and the tunnel section never went ahead, so what we've got now is the exact same setup, just with more and larger vehicles. The Cultural Centre will still be a massive choke point and frankly I can see it becoming quite a dangerous stretch for pedestrians. Definitely not ideal.
126. It was originally going to be underground. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfcJNYPYD7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfcJNYPYD7s) It's often forgotten that Mater Hill was also going to be put underground so the existing busway space could be used to expand the hospital. https://preview.redd.it/o80uxwha0mwd1.png?width=1480&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd81edb7c18cf6d77a5824f821535bca8366a3fb
127. yes lol. there is no sharing with pedestrians even at cultural centre/QPAC, pedestrians go over a bridge
