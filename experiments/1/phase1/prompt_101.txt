Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. I only been here for 8 years. 4 years ago I moved to Perth for 2 years then come back. 1. Depends on your occupation, maybe GC is mainly tradies and hospitality but both are very seasonal. My partner works in IT (support/networking), he doesn't find it hard to find a job. 2. Public transport still bad as in not really reliable except for trams. I drive now, but travel takes longer bcs roadworks down south 3. House price are crazy, rent are hard to get 4. I love the laid back feeling in GC. I am not into big city like sydney or melb. Brisbane and Perth are big enough for me. 5. Compare to Perth, I prefer the GC because the weather here just *chef kiss*. I am from Bali, so here feels like home. 6. GC airport starting to expand, I expect to see more int'l direct flights üôè 7. I am afraid of teenager here. I had 2 bad encounters with them, but worked with one like couple years ago, but she was amazing. So, really depends on school and parenting, i guess? - the one I worked with went to one of the best school in GC. Thats from perspective of someone who moved here, left, then moved back üòÅüëç
2. It's got worse.im so old I remember the zoo behind cavillles surfers paradise hotel.i grew up at tweed heads but always lived in Brisbane. SP used to have the ambiance of double bay Sydney or Monte Carlo but asphalt car parks high rise they threw the baby out with the bath water.it was the holiday destination for graziers between 40's 60"s probably bc of TSS who were knee deep in cash (wool lb/pound)have gone.driving thru SP & getting Chinese at the Chinese restaurant opposite where the chevron hotel was .my father said it wouldn't last.it has but at a cost.walking out of the SP hotel beer garden up Elkhorn av to the beach What delicious memories
3. Sounds heaps then Muzzbourne
4. Born and raised on the GC but moved back and forth a lot as an adult (which is good to compare the gold coast 1-2 years apart multiple times) I'd say, if you were to aggregate the opinions of locals and asked better or worse -- the older generation would be overwhelmingly negative, the younger ones probably somewhere between the same to slightly worse Travelling to Brisbane is still a "thing" but rarely works for long due to the huge cost and time sink - I wouldn't count on it. Fortunately, I would say job opportunities are perhaps more diverse and there are some more sophisticated opportunities now vs before - which is perhaps a nice bonus The lifestyle is much the same in essence, although it's far more expensive to maintain the same convenience as 10-15 years ago without paying substantially more ... If you're happy to bus to the beach or whatever, it's probably just the same as ever In terms of the school and youth culture -- been out of school 15 years but a few friends with younger siblings (subjectively, of course) report that private schools have fast become more snobby but the public schools (once again, varies a lot from generation or school) said they'd gotten slightly better Drug and alcohol use seems high among kids but you'd really need to see if it's any lower anywhere else in Australia for context (in my opinion, which is not really deep here anymore) but drugs were always popular when I was younger and use was widespread although rarely with as much violence as these days Personally, it's very contingent on the crowd you're with ... I might have gotten lucky or some others just unlucky, hard to say... I think it's hard but possible to do "better" than the GC in theory, but it would be very easy to do a whole lot worse
5. Busy
6. It‚Äôs where the action is. Great if you are young and outgoing. I‚Äôm not sure about raising a family there but it can be done. It‚Äôs pricey now too
7. My parents just visited from the UK, took them all over, hinterlands, Byron, whale watching, national park at Burleigh, beach swims, they loved it. Have gone back to grey miserable dark shit.
8. worse more work. more dropkicks more trash culture lifestyle worse (people) still sunny
9. Gold Coast council have a projection of an added 199 thousand homes before 2042 and an extra 900 thousand people. Wild. Strap yourselves in it‚Äôs only going to get worse.
10. The ladies wear heaps less at the beach during the summer and same at night on the town
11. Worse, but still better than the favelas of Brazil or the ghettos of India. Party capital, drugs drugs drugs. Need coke? Molly, ice, Frank, shit anything you want you can get here. It's fucked, everyone's on drugs and pretending it's OK. Those that can't see it must have rose coloured glasses or be so naive its not funny. People are getting stabbed and shot more regularly - drug dealer problems etc. Cops are even more dodgy and corrupt. Just seem to ignore crime and hand out traffic infringements to raise revenue for the state government after they figured they couldn't afford the Olympics. Cameras being installed every fucking corner but not for solving crime!? Infrastructure is still 20 years behind what it should be. A 20 min drive now takes an hour. Be lucky to find a park near a beach at all any day of the week. The federal government increased immigration to hide gdp figures and fucked the housing sector. Used unskilled migrants and now houses built post covid are all fcked and should be knocked down. I don't know anyone I grew up with that isn't either a meth addict or a drug dealer or a career criminal. They lied, crime pays, it pays so much fckn better than being a slave. And there's plenty having a crack at the cherry in south east qld.
12. Just a tip, When you ask any group of people who have lived in any town in the developed world whether things have gotten better or worse over the years, the answer will always be worse. Not because things are actually any worse, but because our level of awareness of antisocial fuckwittery increases with age and our tolerance level of it decreases at the same rate, especially once you have kids of your own.
13. More traffic. That's about it. I mean technology keeps advancing but this cultural black hole hasn't changed socio-economically my entire life.
14. One of your points is why I hate it. If you‚Äôre not driving in fake tan, living in the gym, flashing your fake too big for your mouth and could blind you teeth, and living on a diet of diet pills, steroids and party drugs then you don‚Äôt really fit in anywhere if you‚Äôre under 45
15. I think you already know that the GC is a pretty boring place to live full time. Remember driving up and down the M1 and GC hwy looking for something to do? Beach, sports oval, mall, repeat. People are friendly but they‚Äôre not interested in anything except their local group, trade work, sports, petty investment, schools. To be fair, this describes most (all) of Australia, but GC feels even more aimless.
16. 99$ Locals movie world pass back then
17. üçø
18. I‚Äôm from there too, grew up in the ‚Äò80‚Äôs but wondered about moving back. Most of the family are there, and my parents are getting old. I‚Äôve been in Brisbane for 25 years but I‚Äôm in the process of changing career to something less capital city based. The locality stuff above rings true, and Southport and surrounds have always been pretty rough! Not changed then üòÇ The house prices might be an issue though üò≥
19. The best thing about GC is you get to pick your lifestyle. If you want laidback beach / surf culture, go south. If you want boats, fishing and golf, go north, if you want hustle and bustle, restaurants, cafes and shopping, go central. If you want horses, acreage, rainforest, hikes and mountain biking, go west. If you want to get a bunch of mismatched face tatts, lose most of yor teeth and have screaming fights with your equally battered looking girlfriend in the middl of a crowded shopping center at lunchtime because neither of you have slept for 5 days, go to Southport.
20. Agreed, I've lived here for 25+ years and I prefer it over big cities like Melbourne or Sydney.
21. [deleted]
22. I went to st Michael‚Äôs too, I‚Äôm 39 so you must have been a year up from me haha, thanks for the comment.
23. There are definitely more opportunities than there were 20 years ago, but that being said, it really does depend on who your kids hang around with. Also, Brisbane has come a hell of a long way in the last 20 years and is commuting distance away, so it's not like living up in Townsville or something where moving to get a job means leaving everything, setting up from scratch in a new city and having to use your holiday time if you want to see your family and friends.
24. The main thing to consider with Gold Coast is what area can you afford to buy into, because honestly, if you can only get something in one of the endles suburbias on the western side of the M1, like Pacific Pines, and you have to commute to Brisbane rather than work in GC, do yourself a favour, buy in Brisbane and commute to the beach on weekends instead of the other way around. I have a friend who bought in Pac Pines because his wife really wanted to live in Gold Coast, he has a 3 hour round trip commute 5 days a week and on weekends he has to work around the yard, because there's no time during the week, so once he's done with that he just wants to rest. They get to the beach or drive ito surfers / Broady once a month if that and he doesn't get much time with his kid. Can't help thinking they could have bought into Kelvin Grove or Toowoong for a similar price at the time, he would have had a 20 minute run into work if that, they could have gone into the city or Southbank on a whim without having to drive and could still drive to the beach once a month. People get too hooked on the idea of the "Gold Coast Lifestyle" without realizing it costs extra.
25. I live in Tugun and going to the beach is never a hassle... Even to Cooly
26. Depends where you live. Some areas are great for kids.
27. I live just on the NSW side of the border north of the Tweed river and I don‚Äôt even like going to Elanora. Fuck the traffic.
28. House is on the market and I'm ready to run...
29. I lived and worked in Surfers and then Runaway bay for 10 years. If you can get a good job or business in GC, then it's an awesome place to live, one of the best in my book, but if you have to commute to Brissy or live way out in the north western suburbia, you're better off to just live in Brisbane where you have the option to get around without a car and then drive to GC any time you want to go to the beach.
30. Big Chiefs!! There‚Äôs still a dodgy one in Cooly. I used to ride my 125cc dirt bike through varsity swamp, now it‚Äôs a fucking community
31. Classic water rock ball! I‚Äôm not actually sure if that‚Äôs still there but Robina town centre has changed dramatically! I haven‚Äôt been there for ages but pretty sure it was all mostly undercover when I last was there.
32. It‚Äôs ok, the LNP are in power now, they said they‚Äôd fix crime üòè
33. Marie‚Äôs pizza fukn best pizza ever!
34. Probem with Sunny Coast is the distances you have to drive to get around, you spend half your life in the car. Goldy is more condensed, traffic sucks but the distances are lees and Sunny Coast is catching up fast with the traffic congestion.
35. What was the community like when you grew up in Southport v now
36. Sorry I edited because stupid me said I grew up in Helensvale which I did not.
37. Just wondering, are the people who say the Gold Coast is ‚Äúplastic‚Äù or ‚Äúfake‚Äù just going off the general Surfers Paradise area? Because the rest of the Gold Coast isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfake‚Äù or ‚Äúplastic‚Äù
38. Sample experience. Mcdonalds "table service" order placed. Staff visually all stressed, pack order in paper bag ignoring table service. Items missing. Ask junior staff for missing item & put receipt on counter to show them. She mishears & thinks I want her to keep the receipt. Freezes solid & asks me to please keep the receipt. Repeat the request again. She then says "it's in the bag". Ask her to check. She checks & realises it's not. Face turns bright red, goes back to kitchen & returns with item and "Have a good one"
39. Boring people get bored
40. How is southport as expensive as it is given the reputation it has
41. This is true and that last part was hilarious.
42. üò≠üò≠üò≠
43. Twenty years ago, the only place to eat after hours was the casino restaurant, Melbas and I think one 24 hour Maccas just opened up. Yes, GC isn‚Äôt on the level of other capital cities but there has been quite a revival starting 10 years ago. There‚Äôs like 5 Korean fried chicken stores to choose from. Chinese like you mentioned. Loads of excellent small bakeries and good coffee. Tons of fine dining places that weren‚Äôt here before. Definitely a big improvement since back then
44. You're just not going to the right places!
45. [deleted]
46. Small world!
47. Yep, couldn't agree more. My friends were/are good people, they just weren't good for me. I'm still friends with all of them and they are the best, now. They've all grown up and made something of themselves too. Many did that without ever leaving the GC I think that the key to good decisions is introspection and reflection.
48. True! Ive just had mates move away with their families up to Hervey Bay, regional or 1770 and seems to be a better lifestyle for raising families now! Just their opinion and experiences I guess ü•∞
49. Let alone going over the Tally bridge
50. Is the Big Chiefs in Southport still there? That, Wahoo's and that carribean roti place in Mermaid were my favorite 1990's post beach / pre beer "I suppose we should eat something, but I'm not getting changed first" venues.
51. The ball is still there, but no water and doesn‚Äôt move anymore. Just sits and bakes in the sun all day.
52. Best people too, my car broke down once with me and my 4 year old daughter stuck by the side of the road in the middle of nowhere, peak summer waiting for a taxi that probably still hasn't arrived. The female owner pulled up in the delivery car, asked if we were okay, gave my daughter a cold bottle of water and went out of her way to drive us home. Flat out refused payment when I tried to give her money. It's been my go-to pizza ever since.
53. It's good to have a variety to choose though.
54. So nice, we knew our neighbours & there was a local corner shop we used to go to all the time, it also had a hairdresser which we all had our hair cut at , & a barber where my grandad went. We rode our bikes everywhere & it was safe. No homeless people, no drug addicts, just a normal society.
55. Completely agree. It's an annoying stereotype that is far from an accurate depiction of the majority of the Coast.
56. You don‚Äôt get out much if you think it‚Äôs only surfers. Every single one of the suburbs along the water is full of them. Burleigh is full of them especially
57. [deleted]
58. Southport police station is the main station for parolees to do their required check in's and the main centrelink office is just down the road, if they move those 2 buildings somewhere else, Southport will become a totally different place almost immediately. You might even get a vibrant Melbourne style restaurant and bar culture opening up there. Right now it's the fancy new buildings themselves as well as the promise of that bright, crackhead free future that people are payng the premium prices for.
59. It's just the polish being applied lately. It's still a hostile place to live, but I find that charming. New residents seem to move as quickly as they arrive.
60. [deleted]
61. Those savages that‚Äôs horrible.
62. "No homeless people, no drug addicts, just a normal society." You could apply this to every regional city in Australia before the bikies discovered that meth creates much more loyal and regular customers than plain old speed used to.
63. Yep, along the coast and also people in properties on the edges of the canals. It‚Äôs all plastic. Anyone who thinks it‚Äôs not either doesn‚Äôt get out much or does it with blinders on
64. [deleted]
65. Yes & it‚Äôs destroyed them all
66. I have a canal house, what's so plastic about wanting to paddle my kayak before work in the morning? Most of my neighbours are either proffesionals with kids or retirees who bought in the 90's. I'd say there's more implanted titanium than there is plastic. The plastic people generally live in units in Surfers / Broadbeach, with a few wannabe plastic people who post instagram videos from the beach or the cafe every morning but drive in from Coombabah to take them.
67. I‚Äôd love you to point out exactly where *anyone* has said specifically that every single person in waterside homes fits into the plastic demographic. You won‚Äôt find it. There being high numbers of that type who tend to congregate in certain areas doesn‚Äôt make every single person that way
68. properties on the edges of the canals. It‚Äôs all plastic Your words champ.
69. And yet none of those words say every single person‚Ä¶
70. So what does "all" mean? maybe youmeant to say most, or some?
71. There's new housing being built everywhere on the Gold Coast so there is no excuse for homelessness. Most new apartments are starting from as little as $2.3 million, so it's not like they're unaffordable!
72. Yeah that‚Äôs just a flat out assault. I‚Äôm currently homeless and would never do something so crazy. You‚Äôd assume it‚Äôs drugs so I I‚Äôd report the assault to the police. Have a great weekend.
73. That is assault - did you bother to report it ?
74. As much as it sucks to say, but you have to call Crimestoppers or similar and at least report it. A lot of homelessness is due to poor mental health (amongst other factors) and by calling Crimestoppers, opposed to the police directly, they may get some actual help.
75. This is disgusting, I‚Äôm so sorry to hear this happened to you and your family. Burleigh needs a police presence and station, long overdue. Was the guy short, wearing army pants with a buzz cut?
76. gold coast was always going this way. its economics doesnt make any sense.
77. I‚Äôd call the police. Spitting is a big no no. It‚Äôs considered a serious assault.
78. This is sounding like San Fran.
79. I agree. I want to feel safe in my city. Recently a foreign man was touching himself on the train at 6 pm. It was beyond gross.
80. We had this issue up in broadbeach. Unfortunately we had multiple issues with assault with one person and it was escalated right up to the police minister, council and government. He has been moved on now. It was very scary and we considered moving over it. Feel so much safer now.
81. [deleted]
82. Don't bother with the police at Palm Beach. I was assaulted by "Tamara", well known local homeless lady drinking a goon bag and high on meth at 2.30pm one midweek afternoon in that park. Got punched in the face and police made it seem like it was nothing when I reported it in person. I left without making a statement even though I had footage on my phone, cameras in the busstop where I was chased then assaulted and had rung 000 immediately after it happened! A few weeks later around 10.30 am I came across Tamara sober, begging for money outside Woollies metro. I approached her after I had shopped, I bought her a sausage roll with sauce and offered to roll her a cigarette. We went to the carpark to smoke and I basically got her life story. She obviously didn't remember punching me, but i asked about her circumstances and listened to her sad and tragic life story. It actually gave me closure for what happened to me. OP if you do report it and are made to feel the same way as me, a time- waster in police eyes, you should maybe mention the police are covering this up and encouraging people not to report. I was actually more emotionally hurt by the police response than I was by the actual assault!
83. Unfortunately it‚Äôs going to get a lot worse before it gets better.
84. Burleigh is a mess these days‚Ä¶ most born and bred locals are getting out of dodge for good
85. Sorry that happened to you and your family. No excuse for this bullshit, this is the result of meth and zero repercussions where the police do nothing
86. Charge them with assault for the spitting. Aside from that, all you can do is report. I ONLY say the following because I've worked with homeless drug addicts in a professional capacity and it was an eye opening experience. Completely changed the way I see them. Cut them some slack for being homeless, turn a blind eye to the drugs, you don't know their circumstances, but don't ignore abuse or assault. Always report that or any vandalism. And any theft that isn't food. I might cop shit for saying that, but I've seen the other side and its not nice at all.
87. If he spat on you, that‚Äôs common assault. The police should have arrested him.
88. That‚Äôs worth a left right goodnight
89. Long term the best solution would be the re-allocation of funding from the police into social outreach & rehabilitation programs. As the cost of living & housing go up more people will find themselves doing it tough, sleeping in the cars or the rough. This can lead to impacts on mental health which in turn can lead to substance abuse as a coping mechanism. I‚Äôm sorry you & yours were spat on, but the solution isn‚Äôt in moving these people out, it‚Äôs by helping them where they are.
90. You should've fucked him up
91. Welcome to late-stage crapitalism.
92. Where do you want them to go? I agree, it‚Äôs horrible that you and your family had to experience this. But this problem is the result of mentally ill people being completely blocked out of the rental market. I imagine doing drugs makes it easier to cope with homelessness and the feeling of being either scorned by or forgotten by their community. As a country we have let down our most vulnerable people and this is the repercussions our society faces as a result.
93. Burleigh Heads has a problem right now as it gentrifies.
94. The situation in Burleigh highlights a significant and troubling issue regarding homelessness and public safety.
95. You could hassle the council and state government to take housing and mental health seriously. Or you can complain to the same to make their individual circumstances worse.
96. A friend of mine was spat on near the Woolies there last year while getting a coffee. Walking past, completely unprovoked. Guy with buzz cut who does laps, well known to police but nothing seems to change. I avoid going to that area on my own now.
97. What‚Äôs the police going to do.. take him in, and, give him a bed for the night :-p
98. The saddest thing about this post, is that most people know the ‚Äòlocal homeless and or drug addicts‚Äô‚Ä¶. These are the same ones that were in Miami when the methadone clinic was there, then they moved it to palm beach on 5th ave. This is nothing new. Despicable nonetheless, as most of the ‚Äòusuals‚Äô were never abusing people, and heavily relied on others to give them money.
99. send a photo on what he looks like gang
100. I hope you defended your wife and son from physical danger by immobilising the offender until the QPS came. Spitting is a serious offence, irrespective of his predicament with mental health or substance abuse, we should all be entitled to public safety and offenders like him prosecuted.
101. You would be mortified if you went to Southport. The Gold Coast is literally Logan with a beach.
102. My hairdresser is just near the woolies. I had an appointment on Thursday and there was a drugged affected fellow carrying on. The shop tenants & public deserve at minimum roving security like shopping centres. We live in Burleigh & 5 yrs ago would go to restaurants etc in James Street not anymore.
103. Burleigh is fucked at the moment with the light rail extension how long is that shit going on for
104. Imagine what your wife deals with when she‚Äôs alone
105. Man up and deal with him, this is fundamentally whats wrong with society, males need to get their balls back and protect your family, don‚Äôt wait for police to do it.
106. Wait till your arm heals. Get a base ball bat from kmart. Wait till dark, go do gods work.
107. What the fuck why didn't you smack him in the fucken mouth first he disrespects your woman then calls your kid ugly.
