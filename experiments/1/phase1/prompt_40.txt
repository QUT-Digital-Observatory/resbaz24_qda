Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. I think your question is very fair. I am a swinging voter. I swing at every election. I just look at the policies of the parties and the environment and vote accordingly. What I find difficult is having conversations with party faithfuls who would defend 'their' party no matter what. In my view, that's actually not very helpful and doesn't really address the issues of the day. It's pretty evident that there is no perfect party but I vote for the party that, on balance, can meet the challenges of the day.
2. If you ever live near a train station you will always get higher crime. Just how the younger kids get around.
3. Look your wife in the eye and tell her you just voted to potentially take away her right to choose what she does with her body.
4. Imo it's pretty simple, the cost of living relief that Labor brought was some of the best in the world. The energy rebate, the rego freeze, it's all going to get axed soon cause of course they won't be able to pay for it once they lower the mining royalties. This whole youth crime thing won't get solved by locking up kids, that's just going to make them criminals for life, you fix this shit by getting people out of poverty and bad situations, which things like the school lunches would help with. And on a personal note as a public sector worker, our entire unit still hasn't recovered from being crippled by the Newman government. The new privatization initiatives from the LNP will definitely make things worse for the public and leave alot of people out of work for no benefit. The LNP refusing to actually make a call on any policy is very concerning. Everywhere you look is scars from the last LNP government, and the new one certainly ain't goin' to make them better.
5. I'd say take a look at the last time they were in power around the time of Campbell Newman's reign in QLD, there was major cuts to public sectors and absurd levels of putting money into the wrong areas to the level it took Palaszczuk YEARS to undo it. The LNP wanted to fast-track the Adani Coal Mine in 2017's election and that basically made it clear they were willing to hedge their bets on the fossil fuel industry despite it slowly becoming more and more clear that it isn't needed for the long-term future, meanwhile Labor has been taxing the mining industry itself to allow for the Energy Rebates (both kinds of them) and the 50c fares as well as the lower rego fee's to combat cost of living. The fact they'd want to do a deal with One Nation in the past and now seems to wanna do business with Katter's party to ensure a crossbench in QLD if things seem like a minority government is being formed instead should tell you a clear red flag there alone. I don't think you're a bad person if you voted for LNP based on the Youth Crime stuff if it was affecting you in your neighborhood, I just think voting out Labor again after 9 years of things going on the up for the state just to be reminded of how bad the LNP truly are for the next four years due to one specific issue being pushed constantly on morning news shows for an entire year straight is not the way to go. I hope you see sense in four years and vote them out, but for now I hope you're able to live with the choice for focusing on one of many important issues, of which the one you focused on may have been more personal, but it was certainly the lesser important one long term
6. First of all you should stop being on those community Facebook groups
7. Idk might be wrong but it seems if you cared about policy you would have asked this pre election, not post. But if you really want an answer: The LNPs entire campaign was based on youth crime and I’m sorry to hear about your neighbourhood but statistically speaking, youth crime has been on a consistent decline for the last ten years. And let’s hypothetically say that youth crime was increasing, there is zero evidence to suggest that harsher mandatory sentencing laws will reduce youth crime AND lets go even further, even there WAS evidence that harsher sentencing reduced crime, the LNP can absolutely not overhaul QLDs sentencing legislation to make this happen any time soon. What actual is proven to reduce crime? Pulling people out of poverty, which was being addressed by the Miles government through free school lunches, 50c fares, subsidised rego, energy rebates, more bulk billing GPs… And actually yes we could afford this stuff because FINALLY one of our politicians had the balls to up the royalties on coal, which is what is paying for all this stuff btw. On the other side of the coin, the LNP will axe all of the above and instead plan to cut essential workers to save money. You can say farewell to any bulk billing GP btw. And like you say you have no faith in the Miles government to pull off the Olympics? The LNP hasn’t even GOT A PLAN! How does that possibly give you the faith they can pull it off? I am truly devastated by this election result but will always remember that I was on the right side of history.
8. No other state properly funded their budget by including a proper resource royalties structure. This is nothing like the Andrews govt that had nothing to work with in terms of infrastructure because the LNP sold it all. Qld taxpayers (individuals) under the ALP are not the only source of income. We can afford better of lots of many things. We sell high quality product resources) into a close market at rates that are amazing for the miners, but shit for the people of Qld. And here’s the thing. In Alaska (in the almighty capitalist USA) all citizens get money and services from oil royalties. The LNP have refused to do the same in the past and basically forgone taxing miners to any competitive level. They’re so full of shit about us not being able to afford it - what they mean is that the miners don’t want to pay taxes so that we can have better. L/NP philosophy is one of user pays. It’s a shame that their Christian beliefs in man sharing the bounties of the earth only works for multinationals and paid-for political policy. As a state we own much of the capability to serve the state without expensive, scalping, and proven unworkable privatisation. We have been in a better place than nearly every other state.
9. Definitely sound advice to get off facebook..Particularly those community pages. There is a QLD location based crime map you can google. It’s ran through QPS and the government. You can search your local area or your own address and it will show you the stats of actual recorded crime and breakdown by numbers the types of crime going on in that area across week’s, months and years.
10. If you think the “adult time for adult crimes” policy and the “war on drugs” is actually going to have any long term benefits and not eventually worsen the problem then I dunno what to tell you buddy.
11. CFMEU has little to do with the cost of most construction, lack of skilled workers is a big part 50c fares are paid out of the pocket of Mr adani
12. Lnp are opposed to pioneer-burdekin pumped hydro scheme. Something we need before 4.4GW of power stations eol by 2040. Decrease or mining royalties. I work in mining, no projects are on hold based on royalties in qld. So it's just giving money away for no benefit. Abortion. How tf is that even a topic. Pill testing is a good. It keeps people out if hospital which saves money. Increasing punishments for crimes are shown to not have a significant change in crime rates. So "adult crime, adult time" will have zero to negligible effect on rates, but cost more money to have them in prison longer and reduce any chance of them being contributory members of society in the future. Outside of that, there were no policies given by the LNP. So all announced policies were a negative, and the rest hidden.
13. Well, there are scores of developer blocks sitting still, my local MP told me a major development that's been anticipated for a decade is constantly held up by greedy developers shifting the goal posts. Then there's all the land banking and spite houses

15. Good question. My thoughts are it’s a combination of 1 there’s naturally fewer more conservative voters on reddit 2 the ones that are here stay silent, because they are outnumbered and also because- 3 the arguments used these days too often just write the other side off as dumb or fascist or evil or whatever instead of at least communicating without just shouting insults and trolls at each other. It’s easier to not listen and just shout at your phone screen, rather than seek to learn and see a different perspective even if you disagree with it. Being able to do this is some of the glue that holds democracies together.
16. Well I am the total opposite to you. Single income family always earned the equivalent of 2 normal wages, way above the average in bank and super savings, own my house outright, lived within my means and always voted LNP. For the very 1st time I voted Labor, because I feel Steven Miles offered the better alternative and had great initiatives to help Qldrs suffering from the current cost of living crisis, high cost of housing and rents. I believe crime figures are not any different than they were in the past. The only difference is the advances in communication and social media make it appear that it's a bigger issue and out of control. The 50c bus fares, the freeze of car rego, kids school lunches and $1000 help with electricity costs, whilst it wont make much difference to my family status with both my kids grown up and having their own careers, I know it will make a hell of difference to lots of families. My oldest son is a high school Maths and Business teacher and tells me the daily challenges on the school grounds with some kids not having food or accommodation in their everyday life and teachers having to help them in that respect. A life of crime to survive is the only choice for some of those students. It's unfortunate, but reality. Throwing kids in jail is not the answer to stop the crime to survive to manifest itself on society.
17. The liberals rely on people misunderstanding how the world works and essentially being conned into voting for things that will make life worse for them. A lot of the problems in society are complex, and require complex solutions, and it's much harder to explain those to people and sell them on it than it is to cultivate fear. to give you an example on crime - there isn't actually a crime problem. The total number of crimes has gone up because the population has gone up - more people means more of everything happening - but the crime rate - the number of crimes per capita - has actually gone down. but you can't explain that to someone that just got their house robbed because they've been personally harmed. The LNP exploits people's fear and desire to make themselves feel better about what's happened to them by promising all this tough on crime stuff - but tough on crime has never been an effective way of reducing crime - it's never worked anywhere in the world. In fact it's been proven to have the opposite effect - draconian laws makes crime worse. This is because the overwhelming majority of crime is inextricably linked to poverty and disadvantage. setting aside the tiny proportion of crime that is the result of evil people doing evil things, most crime is desperate people doing desperate things to survive, or people who feel so left out and hopeless that they turn to drugs and/or gangs, which in turn fuels a vicious cycle. For youth crime, it's been very conclusively proven that you have to intervene in young people's lives in a positive way - improve their home lives, give them positive stuff to do to and foster positive relationships through extracurricular programs, improve access to mental health services, make sure they can eat 3 good meals a day so they can actually learn in school, etc. The minute you send a kid to prison, you're basically guaranteeing that they'll become a hardened criminal; it absolutely needs to be a last resort. But doing all of those things is hard, slogans like 'adult crime adult time' are easy. on the economy, people fundamentally misunderstand how it works. A government budget is not like a family budget - governments exist in perpetuity, so they don't actually have a strict time limit to pay off debt. Debt isn't bad, the liberals just like to demonise it. When times are tough, you have to spend more to boost the economy - the debt actually results in a stronger economy and more money for the government in the long run. Then when things are booming, you ease back on spending to reduce your debt and prevent things from growing too fast which causes it's own problems. The political right, fundamentally, are crooks - their objective is to plunder society in order to enrich a very small proportion of people. they don't care about you - the left understands that to create a prosperous society, those with greater wealth have a duty to contribute more. This is why the liberals hate things like welfare, medicare, any sort of spending on stuff that doesn't benefit the wealthiest. In their world view, the poor don't deserve help. Except in the real world the economy actually needs a certain level of unemployment to fuction properly, so we have a duty to make sure the unemployed aren't living in poverty. When you reduce poverty, you make society better for everyone in the long run. The right will talk about trickle down - they say that by making rich people richer through lower taxes and fewer regulations, that wealth flows down to those below via more jobs and higher pay - except that's never been shown to be true. On Housing, again, they don't actually want house prices to come down, or build new houses to quickly, because skyrocketing rent and housing prices and the high cost of construction is making a very small proportion of people very wealthy at the expense of the community as a whole. then you've got the social conservative stuff - in recent decades the Liberals have been taken over by hardline religious fundamentalists who want to send the country back into the 1950s by stripping away hard won rights from women, gay people, etc. and finally there's the environmental stuff - the liberals are so taken over by vested interests in the mining industry that they have started to flat out ignore the scientific reality, and so they're actively trying to prevent the transition to renewable energy, greater environmental protections, etc. to them it's all about making sure their mates can make as much money as possible, and who cares what happens to everyone else. The right is also inherently authoritarian, and anti education, because fear and control, and a poorly educated population makes it easier to fool people into voting for them. The right is racist, because it's human nature to fear things that are different, and exploiting that gives them a convenient scapegoat to blame for people's problems to distract them from the real issues.
18. It's more so the history....it took years to recover from the last time LNP touched the top job. The track record and more specifically the track record of the leader does not fill the state with much confidence. Waiting to see how he goes and hopefully proves the haters wrong but the chances are low and won't be surprised if they sack the leader half way through the term just to try and save face for the next election
19. If you vote for people who's policies are fascist, and you agree with them, then maybe you're a fascist. Just like not all votes from the Nazis came from the Nazis, but they were fellow travellers...
20. Not withstanding that you just voted for a party that said it wants to take away the rights of women and take away medical privacy: You voted in fear. You think a tough on crime stance will help you because your neighbourhood has a bit of crime. Why not vote for a party that says it will decriminalise drugs (drive the price of drugs down reducing some of the reasons people commit break and enters), increase treatment programs for drug offenders and minors so they have a better chance at not reoffending, increase funding for children at risk ie free lunches, free transportation, employment and education schemes for children more third spaces to decrease the reason a lot of young people commit crimes. When I hear the slogan “adult time for adult crimes” i hear “I want to jail children and minors for being at risk and being raised in harmful environments. I want to jail children rather than deal with domestic violence, the cost of living, the rental crisis and an overloaded healthcare system that is struggling to treat mental illness and drug addiction.” If I know someone voted lnp i know they are heartless, classist and misogynistic.
21. You made your choice, Good for you. Let's see how you're going in 3 years time. PS. Nice use of all the anti ALP talking points. Terrific troll!
22. traditionally the Libs are the party that robs from the people to give to the extremely rich, which of course is a crime that makes crime worse. Worldwide countries like Australia are a mess because parties with such policies have privatised everything, white-anted public health and housing, and stopped taxing those super rich. Major wars are under way so that the globally super rich can take others’ cake (eg. Ukraine being sold to Blackrock and Beyer-Monsanto, Israel grabbing Syria’s and Gaza’s oil) and the Murdoch media want you to think selling the future to Adani is the answer.
23. Good on you for putting your post out there. Your experience resonates with me. Regardless of stats,there's been a lot of visible crime in my neighbourhood too. And yeah Miles was on the nose. To me it seems so odd that even though polling has shown, for a while now, that queenslanders were moving to the right, Miles essentially went left (50c fares, school lunches, higher royalties etc.). So instead of moving his policies to suit the appetite of QLD, he's essentially cannibalized the greens and left hoover in the votes.
24. I think the federal Labour Party made a few blunders during their term. Especially by trying to import American style “guilt” politics into Australia. The Yes/No vote probably being the apex of these. Their response to the “No” winning out just pissed the public off even more. On top of all that, they went down the road of Union bashing and putting the CMFEU into administration. The CMFEU also has roped a number of other unions to stand with them on their messaging, most adjacent construction unions like plumbers and ETU. But also others including teachers unions to bus unions. Whether you like or dislike unions , this is a huge factor. Their friends and family also would be influenced by this. Labour shot themselves in the foot. Their smugness lost them the state election. Who ever is handling their PR needs to be fired immediately.
25. Reddit is a left wing platform. Facebook is more right wing leaning. Always going to be pro left in this sub. I think Qld has a lot of “middle vote” (centre left/centre right) swinging voters. Only takes a couple of policies to swing them to the opposite of their last vote. You seem to have done the same, and it’s based on the anecdotal experience of how you are living currently. Crime doesn’t bother me even though our neighbours had their cars stolen a couple of weeks ago. I’ve lived overseas and it’s nothing compared to that here. Abortion is a women’s issue, even though I’m pro choice. I’m pissed off about the stadium. And I don’t want mining royalties reversed. I like the 50c fares. I like the school lunch idea. I don’t have kids or use PT. Hospital ramping needs to be fixed. I don’t understand why Labor has let it get this bad. I want to see more housing built. Anything. Just build it. It filters down and helps the bottom of the pool even if it’s classed as “luxury” by developers for marketing reasons. No, fkn Max Chandler wouldn’t allow that. I want to see the Bruce Highway upgraded properly for regions so they are safe. Tunnel built on the Northside to go under the Chermside and Aspley shitshow. We need more renewables. Not less. I understand miners have influence and they are concerned about jobs in regions with not many employment options. I get it. I’m a small business owner and capitalist at heart, but not at the expense of my fellow citizens. There are a lot of issues at play constantly, especially in a massive state with a 50/50 population split between inner city and regional areas. And a huge distance from top to bottom with different weather and climate and culture. It’s a very tough situation to navigate politically, and I think most people don’t fully grasp this fact. I would love Daylight Saving, but the bush won’t allow it politically, even if the vote would 100% win in a fkn landslide. It’s too risky. I think this sub generally leans to doing good for people. Which is interesting, as it’s anonymous. While Facebook is more right wing with some putrid discourse at times, by people happy to put their name to their disgusting comments. I don’t know how to explain that part. 🤷🏼‍♂️
26. There are two reasons. trauma from last time LNP was in power. QLD was in bad state last time (massive debt, huge amount of red and green tape) but Newman came in and did too much, too fast. Thinking he was invincible and he ignored the human cost of it all and was arrogant about it. His policies outside of mass sacking however were effective and labor reviewed them for a year and quietly implemented them. The fact remains they did cost a lot of people their jobs (including myself) The second is a lot of things are nuanced and people don't like that. So when the LNP start talking about policy that address that, people take it to the extreme. They don't like complex answers so they think LNP is being sneaky. Labor makes everything seem so easy, and black and white. It makes people feel comfortable. 50 cents fares are an example. Good idea but didn't do any background work like adding more trains, adding parking, get rid of crossing so you can run more trains. This mean that people have started giving up on it. Went from 14% increase of trips to to 4.5% but there was also more complaints per 10000 trips (up to date data on translink API) Or school lunches makes people feel good, but where the evidence it was needed. What percentage of children are actually going hungry, how do you do it for regional qld. why not more targetted programs first, and larger trials that started with regional qld. Renewable energy: seems simple to move everything to renewable, but electricity is hard to store, move, and balance. It needs to be mix of different options. These require a long term planning and cost/benefit analysis. If this get mention it's just LNP is anti-environment, anti-children There is a valid reason to vote for most parties depending on your situation but too many people in australia have started to treat political parties like football teams and become intolerant of the other side.
27. In general the LNP tend to align more with a smaller group of people than the ALP do. For example large companies vs the workers of those companies. More specifically, the LNP have been trying to import too much US style policy ideas. This is very much a "it's time for a change" result, than any ringing endorsement. Let's hope he can do better than his predecessor. Edit: I will say that crime overall is down, and that includes youth crime.
28. The fact that you voted LNP because loads of your neighbours have been broken into shows that you totally drank the Kool-aid on this one. What do you think is going to happen now - a big snow-plough is coming along to sweep them all up? All we're going to get is more hardened criminals. Sticking kids in jail is not going to solve anything.
29. In my eyes it's the LNPs passed policies that let cost of living get so out of hand. The last election favoured Labor but the problems were there already. Labor is much more across the middle in their policies and realise things like "youth crime" isn't going to be solved with harsher punishments, it needs to be rooted in social equity and social support. On top of that for me any party that gets so much money from special interests is never getting my vote.
30. >and the way the CFMEU has been allowed to drive up costs of building in this state, no confidence it wouldn’t bankrupt us. And I work harder than a CFMEU traffic controller for 65% of the daily rate Yeah mate, this isn't true at all
31. > So basically I took a balanced approach to this election, voted the way I wanted too, yet this place makes the type of person I am sound like a fascist. Why? No no no, not a fascist. An *idiot* If you are 28 or older, then either you have no fucking memory, or just like shit.
