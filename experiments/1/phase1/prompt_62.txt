Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. It’s crazy to consider that if LNP retained Labor’s mining royalties, it could cover the estimated $5 billion needed for Olympic upgrades and still have surplus funds left over after just one year. Many people may not fully grasp the scale of revenue being lost and the significant improvements that could have been funded with that money. For context, in the 2021–2022 financial year, Queensland received approximately $7.3 billion in mining royalties . Retaining even a portion of these funds could have substantial implications for public infrastructure and services. But the qld voters have spoken, apparently half the state would rather all that money goes to a few fat ass billionaires instead.
2. Short version? They will fuck everyone so hard that they won’t get back into power for a decade but a few people will make bank.
3. We need that crocodile to predict what the lnp will cut first?! Seriously though, I'm expecting them to go hard on our recent drug law reforms first. They'll cut the schoolies drug testing program first I think. They're likely to wait on abortion until the discourse cools down. They'll do that one in the background and try to sneak it through. 50c fares would be unpopular to cut so I think they'll keep that but only temporarily. Mining royalties will absolutely get cut. So will public servants. Energy rebates won't be until mid next year when they're usually applied.
4. They’re going to build a wall to keep all of the New South Welshman and Victorians out.
5. wealth disparity will increase, poverty will increase (as a result, so will crime), GDP will drop, infrastructure will be left behind, hospital wait times will increase, level of care will decrease typical conservative statistics
6. You'll be deported.
7. I was working at a government department last time it happened. Our project was canned and a lot of people let go. Project was to upgrade Windows servers and desktops to latest versions. Can't remember exactly the versions, but it was one of those once in 5-10 year type things. They did that pretty quickly and then within weeks were in the media complaining that Labor had given them 10 year old tech and it will cost many millions to fix. We were already in the rollout phase with maybe 6 months left and it wasn't a last minute project either, probably a few years of building, testing, training etc. My wife also worked at a government department. They moved everyone from Brisbane out to Ipswich, and made them all reapply for their jobs. It was an incredibly stressful time for everyone in that office and nobody was happy. They literally had to put security guards on to escort people from the building to the train station because of how unsafe it was in the new building. Whilst I don't agree with some of the things either of the Anna's did, it was far far better than anything Newman did during his reign of terror.
8. Basically they'll sell what little assets the state has (even though they make money) cut royalties to miners. Then blame Labor for there being no money for schools and health . Pretty normal stuff .
9. It’s a very long 4 years. And the LNP has a history of some of its sitting members stepping aside/ quitting/ being investigated etc. With a possible majority of only 50, it only takes the loss of 3 members (remembering that the speaker should remain impartial) before they have to negotiate with the cross bench. Or it only takes 3 rogue LNP members to really push for their electorate. Which gapes against party lines. So watch this space I think.
10. What will happen next? Four years of moaning on the r/Brisbane sub.
11. Seriously just chill out. Worrying about stuff you don't have control on is a waste of your energy. Go volunteer your time and put that energy in to good deeds for your community.
12. Not looking forward to being a disability pensioner under an LNP State government. Less healthcare, longer wait times for urgent surgery, let alone what is considered elective. I'm so glad that I'm past menopause so my reproductive health won't be taken out of my hands by the LNP.
13. Breathe. We have elections every 4 years. We don't get hysterically scared. We move on and deal coz we are grown ups and not Americans.
14. Human sacrifice! Dogs and cats living together! Mass hysteria!
15. Because it feels like the day after the 2019 Federal Election with a bunch of morons now in charge. And look how well that all went.....
16. At least the BHP don't get taxed as much. That's a net win if you're in the 0.000000001% of the population bracket
17. I suspect very little will change in the first 4 years , as it would lead to pretty much permanent political suicide for the LNP . There would be nowhere to come back from if they pull a Newman again . So it will be interesting to see how they manage. They will probably need to ring up a shit ton more debt to pull off all promises made without pulling a Newman.
18. Probably not a whole lot would change in the short term. Usually, in an election cycle, the first year comprises mandate changes - we will see youth crime laws change, for example. The second and third year are the years in which the party can be 'harsh' to get what they want out of the day. The last year goes back to 'sweeteners mode' to lure voters to vote them back in for the next term.
19. 50c fares will likely stay for a little while but they will eventually find a reason to get rid of them. They will likely sell off any of their ownership in the public transport network to attempt to reduce their annual spending. So I would expect prices of buses, trains, ferries to increase to a level higher than they were before they introduced 50c fares which in turn would mean that a lot of employees that help operate the public transport network will be laid off leading to a decrease in services. So it’s a lose lose for the people of Queensland who rely on the public transport network.
20. The LNP will change the voting system so that it advantages them. This is trumpian bullshit. We need to hit the streets for this
21. Well hopefully maybe a few people on these forums will leave Queensland seeing as we're apparently about to enter an apocalyptic era according to their comments.
22. Asking that question in this sub is not the best move if you want a broad range of viewpoints. All you need to do is read through the last 4 weeks of posts/topics to see this sub swings very far left of centre. Much scaremongering and fear-campaigning has happened the past month and a lot of people are hysterical at the moment. You'll hear comments like "They'll ban abortion" "They'll scrap mining royalties" "They'll close hospitals and schools and unferfund public services" "Remember what Newman did" "Crime isn't that bad anyway / crime was already coming down" "When are we planning to protest the new government" All of this is scaremongering over-exaggeration. No government that wants to be re-elected will ban abortion, and this government will be acutely wary of the publicity public service cuts will get. The election yesterday will change absolutely nothing on Monday, or Tuesday or even Wednesday. Judge their performance in 4 years for yourself, and if they did a good job and have good policy, consider voting for them - if not, vote for someone else. Just don't listen to any of the hysteria on Reddit.
23. Change is slow, and claims are wild. I would wager on some of them breaking promises of keeping things the royalties taxes paid for, because that Tax going isma day one priority.
24. Expect nothing like the comments here
25. Guess we'll die \*LGBTQ etc voter\*
26. The 50c fares will stop. They aren't sustainable. I'd like fares ro be half what they were. Our fares were too expensive. But mostly we won't see much of a difference. Housing and clinics will continue. They have to, to meet the demands of our explodng population. I'd like to see more affordable mental health services and access to allied health services for people on low to middle incomes. This is a group of people who have been hit hard by the financial crisis but have been overlooked for help. It's hard to pay taxes and levies when you get nothing back and cannot afford to pay for health care for yourself.
27. They will cut the obscene amount of essentially useless consultants providing reports that offer little apart from pages of "i cant be held responsible" Clauses. Then drop the green energy pyramid scheme and utilise existing resources "better". That means cuts and fewer dollars available for thousands. Not necessarily ALL bad, but during this current cost of living issue i dont think jobs and service cuts are a smart move, at least not all at once.
28. Permanent residents can also vote after they have been in Australia for a period of time.
29. Perhaps buses will be better coordinated now. Local and state government are both LNP and I’ve heard bus drivers saying that the state government hasn’t been funding enough buses at the start of the 50c fare.
30. Based on last time, less ambulance ramping, easier development approvals (i.e. to help with the housing crisis) and a better focus on law and order.
31. 50c will stay until they need to fill loopholes in their budget and then it will be “ohhh labor left things in such a bad state we have no other choice but to get rid of it”
32. Reminds me of the time we thought it was a good idea to suck Newman’s dick
33. >cuts to public services oh man it's already bad though :(
34. Thank fuck Labor managed to lock in things like Cross River Rail, which is nearing completion.
35. They ran on extending the Coolangatta rail to Maroochydore so I don't think they are going to cut it.
36. lol Labor had no actual plan or timeline to extend the train line to Coolangatta. In fact LNP have said they’ll extend the pool to Mooloolaba and not stop it at Caloundra like Labor planned to do.

39. I wouldn’t be surprised if they don’t do much of what they planned on doing. This wasn’t the landslide they expected and they won’t want a repeat of Newman by going super fucking hard super fast. Plus Crisafuli is already pretty unpopular so wouldn’t be surprised if they try to not rock the boat much.
40. Nice, I didn’t realise that they had nuclear as an agenda option!
41. I have a suspicion Crisafulli will be a bit more cautious than Newman was. The LNP won 78 seats in 2012 and that would normally mean at least 2 terms in government, if not more. But the LNP lost 36 of them in 2015 because of what Newman did. A 1-2 seat majority is very easy to lose at the next election *or even before 2028*. It would only take 1 or 2 by elections for the LNP to lose its majority. Remember Borbidge became Premier without a general election because of one by election. Things get complicated if he gives the LNP a conscience vote on the KAP abortion bull and 2-3 LNP members cross the floor.
42. Dude, time to move on.
43. I'm not a liberal voter but my god stop with the hysteria. If you really think the government gives money away willingly to private hands then you'll have an easy open and shut case for corruption, fraud and embezzlement.
44. My bf works in government and last time the LNP made a round of job cuts when they got voted in half his department was made redundant, then the bloody government hired them back because the workers were actually needed - but because they were made redundant they had to be fired back as ‘consultants’ for double the salary! Apparently about 4 of his bosses were made redundant in the last round of LNP cuts but they’re still in the department working now coz they just come back for more money 😂 LNP end up spending MORE money because they try and be frugal without realising there is a reason for someone in that job.
45. Just keep copy and pasting on every election post. Someone might read it.
46. Can confirm. Saw a bunch of human cages and policeman rounding up immigrants on my street about 10 mins ago.
47. 123am a police state has been announced. Martial law enacted. The state has been renamed SirJoeLand. Await further instructions.
48. I thought selling off State assets after the election was Labor’s schtick?
49. The cycle is getting shorter
50. You're overestimating people's memory
51. Have you looked outside this morning? Whole state is on fire. I can see Crisafulli outside my bedroom, he looks like Satan from South Park. He is yelling about 50c fares!!!! Send help.
52. RemindMe! 4 years
53. I'm not worried about Wednesday next week... I'm concerned for an unspecified Wednesday any time in the next 4 years.
54. Look at how much ScoMo fucked this country and how much the LNP eroded shit for decades. Albo is nearly at the end of his term and has done almost nothing to change what was done. Even KRudd was unable to unfuck most of Howard’s bullshit. I completely get people don’t like the LNP, I certainly don’t, but it’s not going to turn into a wasteland during this election cycle. Things on the balance of probability won’t improve much if at all, but we’re not about to become Syria like the Reddit echo chamber suggests.
55. Exactly this. What we see here is wolfpack hysteria and over hyped fear for any ounce of change.
56. Public transport is a massive loss anyway, even at the stupidly high fares we were paying. You shouldn't be treating public transport as a profitable business, else you will end up with Air Train type fares everywhere.
57. The LNP has a pretty dismal track record of funding services for the poor. The LNP wants to starve the poor into extinction.
58. I wouldn't mind so much if the fewer dollars were not going to the morbidly obese at the top end of town, rather than the plebs who do all the work.
59. No they can’t. Only citizens can vote in Queensland. Permanent residents cannot vote in Queensland.
60. No loophole needed, the fair were officially on a 6 month trial - 3 months before and 3 after the election. Expect that in 3 months time there will be comments like 'it's too expensive to the budget to maintain and a poor economic choice by labor so unfortunately it has to go... it was only a trial anyway'
61. Yup. They tend to go after public doctors. I’m probably not gonna get a public specialist jobs as an addictions specialist. Will have to go private cuz of this …
62. Just to say it, you know they cancelled the Bus and Train tunnel put of spite and we'd have already had a working railway in service plus no need to lose 4 lanes of the city to the metro and southbank wouldn't be the traffic nightmare it now is... The LNP put the hard work into the rail crossing before trad moved it next door to her investment properties. (OK that was a bit partisan but that actually did happen...)
63. Oh yeah the LNP famously supports public transport and policies that help poor and average people, and definitely won’t cut them first thing after cancelling coal royalties. Definitely
64. So either this is an LNP supporter expressing what they think is an over the top comment made trying to ridicule concerns raised during the campaign or it’s someone who, like me, recalls the Joh era when much of the above was reality.
65. Bribes from coal mining companies
66. It's [pretty easy to understand.](https://australiainstitute.org.au/report/the-tip-of-the-iceberg-political-donations-from-the-mining-industry/)
67. Not your pocket getting lined.
68. You just don’t do that sorta thing to your mates…
69. The argument is that it naturally causes a partial slow down of mining activity, which makes sense. So if there was less super-profit's tax on mines, there would be a lower 'cut off' for what is economically viable, and an increase in economic activity from the mines. So the taxes cause a partial slow down of economic activity in places like Mackay, and the taxes are reabsorbed into the state to fund programs overwhelming outside of Mackay (by natural consequence of Mackay being a place of 80,000 people out of 4,500,000 s) . So an average person in Mackay thinks they'll be better off with a $120,000+ mining job, as compared to a $1000 energy rebate or 50c fare, and you cant blame them. If the federal government absorbed Queensland Mining profits and re-directed them to Sydney and Melbourne I would be livid. I obviously think we are better off with the taxes than without them, but you can see why the regions overwhelming voted LNP.
70. Bosses orders
71. Because the miners aren’t investing in QLD anymore. Don’t eat the hand that feeds you or something like that …
72. Yeah I think it will be a relatively benign first term in the hope of getting a second. Last night I was more worried that they wouldn't form majority. I think a minority government needing Katters help would have been a problem. I shall remain optimistic that they will indeed do well on the things they campaigned on.
73. Its my speculation. Pretty much all consensus from scientific bodies including the governments own is that it will be the most expensive form of power and take decades to implement. What excites you about slowly getting higher power bills at the expense of cheaper green energy projects that we could build now instead?
74. The problem is, in Queensland, if you have a majority that's it, you can do what you want. Especially the LNP who will be given a free hand by the media. But at minimum we'll see mining royalties scraped, so the fat fucks like Clive and Gina can crow about making a little more money for the next for years.
75. Yeah nah, my monies on its gonna be a Newman 2.0 but worse cus he will make add on making abortion harder for women. He's gonna axe the mining tax guaranteed, just check out how much in bribes he got from mining companies. It's right there for the public to see, and will have to recoup that dosh somehow. Added if he decides to keep the 50c fares. Which I highly doubt, cus how's he gonna keep it with no royalties coming in? Unless he slashes gov jobs across the board. It's literally all LNP knows. Oh, and that abortion thing will play out exactly as most people speculated. Mad hatter will put it up, cus he loves causing trouble, and lnp will vote it in according to party lines (ahem conscious vote lmao). On top of ALL that, this is a man known for ruining a business and trading while insolvent AND paying people off to shut up about the details.. This is all known facts. Yeah qlds proper fucked until someone else gets in.
76. Of course he's not going to blood-let like Newman did, the LNP would have learnt that it's political suicide. And I don't know if you've noticed, but politicians like to be in power, not sitting on the sidelines for decades.
77. How naive
78. Lol, you must be new to politics
79. It doesn’t have to be corruption. Swinging mining royalties back towards mining companies instead of the people is an example. Everyone should benefit from the cool rocks we have in the ground.
80. Haven’t the last lot being giving it out to energy retailers under the guise of “cost of living ease”.
81. Did you forget about Paladin Group or nah
82. Boomer living under a rock
83. Can confirm, am in cage. Told I'll be on a jetstar flight out of here in no time...
84. Fed Labor just moved legislation to ensure the NBN wasn't privatised ... So I guess not .
85. You've sure got a point there....
86.

87. You kinda miss my point. The point I'm making is, whether LNP or Labor, 80% of the policy choices will be similar because they're both influenced by the same corporates, the same vested interests. They're not actually interested in rocking the boat because they want to continue appealing to the mass majority and both parties are hunting for the elusive 'centrist swing voter'. If One Nation, the Greens or whoever else had won the election, we could expect more seismic shifts over the next 4 years.
88. can you help and share your opinion too, so people can gauge more than seemingly one side? I'm positive the more information the better for people reading and not posting 🤗
89. Although 50c wasn't sustainable. It was great, though.
90. So, permanent residents can vote in federal elections, but not in state?
91. What part of my comment was wrong? That Labor have zero plan to timeline to extend the rail line to Coolangatta, or LNP have said they plan to extend the Sunshine Coast to Mooloolaba and not stop it at Caloundra, like Labor intend? Have your even read SEQ2031, Labor have failed to deliver/plan/fund 90% of the rail projects they identified as necessary for Brisbane in 2031…
92. People have such short memories. Queensland was such a backwards place under Joh and it's scary AF that we could head back that way.
93. This was pretty much Joh’s policy platform
94. But they can't be bribing them more than they will lose from the lack of royalties
95. Simply not true. If we have profitable minerals, they will mine them. The coming decade, I think, will not be all roses for mining and it will have nothing to do with the royalties and everything to do with the world's economy and economics and a particular deposit.
96. That is great, let the government govern.
97. That would be true if for only one assumption: That the LNP are smart and know how learn from their mistakes. Conservatism, by its nature, doesn't evolve. Get the scissors out
98. What evidence of fraud and corruption do you have?
99. I'm not.
100. Mining royalties is a large discussion to be had, but I don't think labor is immune in this discussion either
101. Add Paladin group to every other poor value for money contractor the government employs. A problem that's rife in both LNP and Labor governments. Bit of unbias analysis please
102. ![gif](giphy|3oz8xLd9DJq2l2VFtu)
103. Don’t worry, that’s what Jetstar always say but you’ll be waiting for hours.
104. Can confirm. I am the jetstar flight.
105. Yet again, confusing federal with state.
106. My opinion on a change of government? It's listed above - nothing significant, nothing fast. However, this time the party leader has said that each portfolio minister will have a clear goal and will earn their stripes inside and outside the party. His role included. This is, in my opinion, fresh, sensible, and, incredibly new to modern politics. I'm hopeful.
107. You could argue that normal prices aren't sustainable also. They all lose money. The same argument could be made for roads, schools, hospitals. But guess what. That is why governments exist. To provide public services. They aren't supposed to make money.
108. Can’t even vote in federal elections as a permanent resident if you arrived in Australia after 1984. Must be a citizen.
109. I can’t even vote in a council election despite being a rate payer.
110. 2031 is 6 years away for a start, and how will the Liberals do it? They lie through their teeth. They’re getting rid of coal royalties so there won’t be enough money for it so how will they pay for it? They’ll cut the public sector so how will they build it?
111. Bribes go to the party, not to the state coffers, so it's a net win for LNP to take the bribe
112. Wrong. Mining is a risky and volatile business especially coal. The investment thesis is stacked on the idea that temporary super profits will outweigh the bad times. Then you have a Peter Pan like demagogue running the state backed by an army of uneducated redditor voters who are happy to cut out the super profits.
113. It hasn't happened yet mate. But any number of dodgy dealing under previous Liberal governments both state and federal. How quickly you seem to have forgotten.
114. Don’t worry reddit is full of blind Labor shills.
115. Imagine communicating in Trump gifs and expecting anyone to take your political perspective seriously.
116. Changes to sentencing laws for youth offenders will be swift, everything else will be slow.
117. 6 years away for start and then build? Lol no absolutely not… not at the rate it gets built in Queensland Labor have even said that they can’t build a rail line all the way to Maloolaba by 2032, not enough time. NWTC has been scrapped for a Gympie Road Toll Tunnel. Brisbane East - West subway scrapped. No timeline on Springfield or Gold Coast line extensions Network segmentation won’t happen now, quadruplication of key tracks is off the table all together. And finally they’ve also said the Beaudesert Line will now be postponed until the 2030s at earliest.
118. Plus probable personal gains for the LNP politicians involved via high paid cushy exec roles in mining companies post politics.
