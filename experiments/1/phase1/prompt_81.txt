Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. I've had explained that it's generally applicable when: A) opposition isn't hopeless (see last time) B) government has been in for three or more terms C) there is a perception of lack of transparency of government (hiding things) - Anna wasn't great on this front, and Steven doesn't get full credit because he's only been in during election mode (and thus is trying to buy his way back in). I've heard a lot of "I need a way to punish Labor without giving the other side a majority". I think we'll see an expanded cross bench as a result - teals+greens+KAP+ONP (I have Ashby as a possible, as much as I hate it), Labor holding strong in Brisbane/Redlands/Ipswich/Logan/MBC, but LNP dominating the coasts and regional cities. That's probably enough to get LNP close to government, and it's probably bad if KAP is required to get them in vs Labor/Green/Indie.
2. I find it frustrating when peolle saybit's time for change. I might not love how things are going, but it doesn't mean I'm going to vote for a worse candidate just because Ibwant a change. I'm wondering if my car would look better in a colour other than silver, but I won't paint it dogshit brown just because I want a change for change's sake.
3. I think it‚Äôs less so that but more so people blaming labour for a lot of the worlds problems. They have the mindset of bad thing happened during labour government = must be a bad party
4. We don't vote in the Premier. Never have.
5. I believe DV numbers are higher than youth crime. But youth crime can be used as a scare tactic without pointing the finger at the voters themselves.
6. According to the Media, it's QLD's biggest problem ever faced. 1974 floods, that's nothing. Greatest natural disaster is the 2024 youth crime crisis!! /s
7. But the news always has segments on (youth) crime, so it must be bad. /s It's Trump's defense. They are eating the cat, they are eating the dogs. I saw it on the news.
8. I'm very aware of this.. people don't understand that it's legal to false advertise in a political campaign as it's part of parliamentary privilege. They could promise every child a place at Brisbane Grammar for free and not have to deliver nor would they get in trouble for it. Yet idiots will read it and vote for whoever said it.

10. Labors renewable investment thing has almost the majority of economic benefits going to the regions. There's hundreds of millions of dollars put aside for renewable manufacturing hubs in areas like Townsville, and almost all the infrastructure projects are happening rurally. It's expected to add $500bn to the states economy by 2050. Most of this is focused outside of Brisbane. Without this, there's almost 100k of job losses throughout the state as a lot of the mining industry wraps up (due to economic factors, nothing to do with environmental policy). Of course, the LNP disagrees with everything but net zero by 2050, and you've got influential figures screaming about how 'insane' it is that the LNP isn't pledging to dismantle all the investment immediately. Even if you don't give a shit about the environment, if you live in the regions you would be absolutely nuts to vote for the LNP. They do not give a fuck about you in any way, shape or form.
11. The fix is government funding and policies that cut red tape to increase employment opportunities. Labor have focused on Brisbane city for their tenure and it‚Äôs now time to see what happens. I personally vote independent when I agree with their policies because in the likely event of a minority government, they hold more power than the premier.
12. The way it‚Äôs reported is making it look like it‚Äôs down. The reality is police are closing cases on incidents quicker than before. Much like if you‚Äôve ever had something stolen. Police come around, make a report, you follow up a bunch of times, they say it‚Äôs unlikely anyone will ever get caught - and from there they keep asking you if you‚Äôd like to drop it constantly so that they can report it as a non incident on their statistics. It hurts their ‚Äúsolved‚Äù cases numbers if not, as well as their ‚Äúpolicing‚Äù numbers by making it look like more crime is occurring. Youth crime is an issue. Very much so.
13. It is on the downward trend because the repeat offenders that were causing a large portion of the crimes turned 18 within the last few years and are no longer dealt with under youth justice. It hasn‚Äôt been fixed, they‚Äôre just moving to the big house instead of detention centres. Do you honestly think that if the services were available that kids in high risk environments would attend voluntary appointments? There would be more no shows than attended. The fix is education and employment to stop the welfare cycle. Employed parents and kids that attend school are far less likely to commit crime. If employment opportunities in regional areas don‚Äôt improve, the crime rate will be back.
14. Actually, it's the Americans who've got the meaning of 'liberal' wrong.
15. The origin of the word? Sure. The reason we spell it like Labor is usually attributed to an American-Australian politician within the Labor party, King O'Malley
16. What have the Greens done recently that has put off the electorate?
17. Your post is like "meh whatever I don't care". If I misinterpreted that then I apologise
18. It's the difference between "doesn't meet the ideal" and "actively working against your best interests".
19. People on welfare who vote for the Liberals just blow me away.
20. Ordinarily and as a Labor voter I‚Äôd have to agree with you. There‚Äôs been very little energy from the Labour Party of recent times but then Steven stepped in and there‚Äôs a sense of promise I‚Äôve not seen from the ALP since Goss.
21. Bang on. Exactly why this time I got off my arse and am volunteering for the greens. Our only hope of actual community representation is to support the greens so they can disrupt the status quo of the duopoly.
22. No way you just claimed Greens are sane or more sane then other parties? Have you seen some of the posts that ACT green reps having been putting out lately? Got to be some of the craziest, radical shit I've seen in a long time. Not to mention Senator Lydia Thorpe who use to be a green rep and we all know what's been happening there üòÖ.
23. No this is exactly what I was talking about. Masturbatory cynicism. It feels good to just say ‚Äúeverybody sucks, oh except this unelectable mob which means I get to forever say everybody sucks‚Äù but that doesn‚Äôt make it helpful or accurate. Both the state and federal ALP have a long list of achievements. The greens are snake oil salesmen and will never have to actually back up their claims. It‚Äôs very easy to tell people you have all the answers, and then stand on the sidelines complaining. The ALP losing votes to the greens is because they are actually pragmatic and need to win over moderates in order to achieve something. Unlike the greens who want to disenfranchise people, win them over and achieve nothing but complain, invent lies like the ‚Äúgas fast track bill‚Äù, vote against their own platform, and demand the federal ALP wrangle the states on irrelevant garbage in order to pass simple legislation. They have a large amount of votes relative to the small number of seats, meaning they do not pick up preferences. People either love them or hate them, which is no way to ever win government. If they carry on as they are, they will forever be a protest party just white anting their own cause to stay relevant. This guy explains it pretty well https://www.reddit.com/r/friendlyjordies/s/sOEQ9wmCgT
24. It‚Äôs wrong. Consider this: the ALP have won 2 federal elections in 30 years. They are the underdogs at the federal level and they know it because the billion dollar media industry props up the LNP. What people call ‚Äúabandoning their base‚Äù is actually just ‚Äúappealing to moderates and not just the far left‚Äù because if they are just forever in opposition they might as well be the greens. The LNP get most of their funding from miners, banks, casinos etc. The ALP get considerably less from them, with a lot of it coming from unions: ie the working class.
25. They're still on the side of business more than they are average joes, but it's just different *types* of business. The things they do to genuinely improve life for the public are a fraction of what they should... but they are still, however, better than the LNP like night and day. But we have preferential voting, so it's not a binary choice and never should be viewed as one.
26. If you have at least one woman in your life that you care about you can‚Äôt vote LNP because they want to criminalise abortion again.
27. I‚Äôve seen it posted A LOT on here, which is very left leaning‚Ä¶. But I‚Äôve not seen anyone post any actual bills or legislation, or direct quotes in context saying they ‚Äúwant to ban abortions‚Äù. I‚Äôve only seen Katters bill amendment to the live births from abortions‚Ä¶.. which doesn‚Äôt say anything about banning abortions; at all. Id be super appreciative if you could post some actual legislation being proposed
28. I‚Äôm yet to see a proposed bill or statements that say anyone wants to ban abortions‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for. I‚Äôve seen the live births bill amendment that Katter put forward but that says nothing about banning abortions.
29. Can you show me where they said that? I haven‚Äôt come across anything where Katter said he wants to outright ban abortions, just make amendment‚Äôs to the live births bill; which isn‚Äôt the same thing.
30. ? Link to the bill, and what it outlined?
31. Perhaps, though not malicious - people find themselves accidentally engaging in confirmation bias all the time. I certainly do.
32. Could you give me an example of this please so I know where I've gone wrong or anyone that agrees with them
33. I suspect you are watching a heuristic in action. People note that you are not wholly supportive of their team, and instinctively downvote without bothering to read any further. This is why I always tend to judge my reddit views based on the written responses to my comments, not just emotive clicks of an arrow.
34. What do you think of these I listed elsewhere? \- Increased funding to early intervention residential programs and $80 million on new court-sentenced facilities for young offenders in remote areas. \- Plans to re-establish the productivity commission to conduct a regulatory review into the building industry as part of their strategy to address cost-of-living issues. \- Increased hiring of healthcare workers \- Plans for the increased construction of social housing These seem both positive and forward thinking.
35. I have no idea where you're seeing that, but Sportsbet and Ladbrokes have Labor at $8.50. I think you're looking at one particular seat betting,
36. What and they just started doing this this election cycle? Thank god they gave us a 30 year head start... I dont know what we would have done with it !!! Why is this election Labor is uniquely unpopular compared to the decades of electoral success. What has changed **this election**?
37. You cite more reporting as the apparent reason for certain crimes being up but then ignore the fact that some people might not be reporting other crimes being up because nothing is done. Do I have evidence police are pressuring people to drop cases? That‚Äôs like asking for documented examples of people not reporting crimes. It‚Äôs just difficult to prove and provide. It‚Äôs not a massive pressure thing, but police actively touch base with you to have a case closed off by a set time to not report on their file/KPIs. They have targets to hit, hence want to make their numbers look good. This is a commonly known thing. Much like any sales person or any other role with KPIs. If a case is closed by a person who reported it, it does not go into ‚Äúunsolved‚Äù or ‚Äúcrime incidents‚Äù reports. It‚Äôs dropped from records if closed within a timeframe.
38. A handful of dot points and some media sound bites don't constitute a policy. [Labor](https://www.stevenmiles2024.com/our-work) and the [Greens](https://greens.org.au/qld/policies) actually have policies and costings that you can read on their websites. [This](https://online.lnp.org.au/therightplan), meanwhile, is the best the LNP can come up with: no costings, and half of each "policy" page dedicated to sledging Labor's "failures." If a party wants my vote, they better bloody well prove that they're ready to govern. The LNP hasn't come close to that.
39. [deleted]
40. !Remindme in 14 days
41. That's a lot of words with no details on why. Sorry for being curious as to what's actually going on behind those stats.
42. One nation have one seat (Mirani) so I‚Äôm doubtful. But keep voting to keep the status quo, QLD just had its biggest coal boom since the mining boom and it was squandered so I can‚Äôt see either party improving QLD now coal prices have crashed and the high royalty percentages over the last couple years don‚Äôt apply to the now lower price.
43. And north Qld, I respect Katter but absolutely disagree with his views on family, women ECT...
44. I think you can still have them when a budget can't pass
45. 0% chance. At most you'll see an agreement for supply. Few parties hate the greens more than labor
46. Careful. That could be a policy come Monday.
47. Let me honest it'd be cream at best, not much will chance either way, but they'll spend billions to do it!
48. Conflating Federal and State parties is always a problem. They should rebrand to QLP and see if that helps people see the difference.
49. Oh yeah dv callouts are at the top of the list for police .
50. More DV call-outs isn‚Äôt always a sign that DV is on the rise. It could be that all the recent DV awareness campaigns have had an effect and it‚Äôs being better reported to police now. But police definitely need more resources to adequately deal with DV either way. As too many other support agencies.
51. Fascinating, isn‚Äôt it. Domestic and family violence at an all time high but LNP thinks criminalising women‚Äôs reproductive right is somehow going to help matters. When we know that it will only serve to keep women and children in dangerous situations.
52. No worries mate, but you should probably talk to someone about whatever it is that's going on. Probably do you some good
53. Good points
54. This is exactly right. The amount of cash being spent on renewable energy is insane. Back in about 2015 there was the fear of a huge downturn in the energy industry and the only thing that was going was the Surat gas basin, now with all of the solar and wind farms and pumped hydro there's so much investment and activity I don't know how they're going to do it all.
55. Exactly. Propping up those coal jobs , so your children will now have even less pathways to these new job types. Deferring the inevitable and selling out the future of the regions for a short term outcome that benefits only the top percent.
56. I‚Äôd rather vote democrats and greens tbh but I‚Äôm voting labour as the threat to female reproductive rights is too close to home for me
57. What red tape? You know regional qld gets far more spent on it per capita than SEQ. Unfortunately in such a spread out state you simply can‚Äôt provide the services and infrastructure that the locals want without spending billions and raising taxes. Any party who tells regional Queensland they can are lying.
58. What source do you have to confirm this is the way police are policing and that's why the youth crime stats are skewed Incorrectly?
59. Have a read of the statistics . Don‚Äôt take my word for it . It‚Äôs definitely a problem, but very complex and not solved by locking children up. Early intervention and robust social strategy works the best
60. Mate if the repeat offenders have turned 18, and there are not as many youth offenders replacing them, then that is a reduction in youth crime. ‚ÄúYouth‚Äù describes an age group, not specific people. How else would a reduction in youth crime look? If the fix is education and employment, then this is the best argument against an LNP government. The previous LNP government strip-mined education and health, which cratered employment in those sectors, which as you know, affects rural areas first. And they haven‚Äôt announced anything new to help either one. Meanwhile Labour has massively invested in education, particularly targeted to the regions that need it, and is creating thousands of new jobs in the energy sector by investing in infrastructure that will continue for long after you and I are dead. And it‚Äôs not just schools, they‚Äôre funding the shit out of TAFE and vocational training for kids that want to stay rural. None of what you want will be delivered by an LNP state government, in fact it will get worse, while Labour is already addressing your major complaints in ways you‚Äôre not aware of.
61. I totally agree , the problem starts well well well before these children start offending. Early intervention and social support strategies work the best and research supports this . Unfortunately, they take time and people want immediate solutions such as ‚Äò adult crime, adult time‚Äô while slogans like this are catchy, it‚Äôs not based on evidence .
62. I don't think so. Please look it up.
63. They haven't, the mainstream media have just run the perfect propaganda campaign against them, so detractors constantly think they've done something off putting recently.
64. No that's on me if I've worded that wrong, I'm terrible with words so that's my bad.
65. Yes, I like him. He is prepared to have a few big ideas. I'm very hopeful that he can turn this around.
66. The LNP are very bad, Labor is often bad, and the Greens are periodically bad too. It's just they do it for different reasons. - the LNP because of intention. - the ALP because of fear and pragmatism, and unwillingness to work to defeat the LNP. - the Greens because of idealism and impracticality and unwillingness to work to defeat the LNP. There is an enemy, but the Greens and Labor represent a divided answer to that shittiness. If they could present two visions for the future, and sell that there isn't one under the LNP, and stop punching each other and start punching the LNP and rightwing media, they might actually be able to do something. But uneasy allies are hard to trust and easy to backstab....
67. I didn't want to move my Greens preference down, but they have been behaving like a bunch of fringe loonies lately, so I put them down the bottom with One Nation. What an own goal on their part.
68. OK, thank you for the correction
69. But Labor get plenty of graft on the unions and corruption and they arent on the side of business at all particularly small business which Labor introduce way to much red tape for small business to operate
70. Aw bless, you actually think the LNP will announce any policies before an election, especially one as controversial and vote cancelling as that.
71. A couple weeks ago, Katter put forward plans to repeal abortion laws. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-08/queensland-election-abortion-lnp-pressure-from-katter-party/104445154 It's only in the last few days that they've suddenly backtracked to an amendment regarding live births. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-22/robbie-katter-abortion-laws-queensland-election/104502092 So yes, there were statements regarding repealing abortions laws.
72. What is unsaid matters too. The LNP hasn‚Äôt stated that they won‚Äôt make any propositions regarding abortion laws either.
73. "Katter's Australian Party (KAP) leader Robbie Katter says his party will put an abortion repeal bill back into Queensland parliament "quick as you like" after the election." https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.abc.net.au/article/104450992#cobssid=s First hit on Google when I searched "KAP abortion"
74. They haven't written it yet. They announced their intention to do it. You can google the dozens of articles about it if you want more details.
75. You have your opinion based on a betting company ü§£ü§£ü§£
76. Because some rich cunts have been muddying the water to make people think that the LNP and Labor have similar policies and a fresh LNP face will bring positive change for the state. Except they don't mention the fresh face is the same dude responsible for firing health workers and lining his and his mates pockets at QLDs expense.
77. So your entire argument is based around something you have absolutely zero evidence of whatsoever, and claim that can never be shown to be happening? Source of evidence for the supposed youth crime crisis: just trust me bro. Classic LNP voter.
78. Thank you.
79. Really hope your just trying to troll at this point and not actually like that coz holy fuck you need to take a chill pill

81. You have one party saying "i am going to rip out renewables and put in new coal fire plants" and one party saying "we want to feed children at school" and you're like "how can i tell these two apart?". Good luck
82. It‚Äôs not even federal vs state. It‚Äôs global issues that that parties point their fingers at each other about as though the ALP government in QLD has caused a global cost of living crisis‚Ä¶
83. And DV is at the top of the list of crimes committed by police...
84. Because women are coming forward.
85. It's not just that there's money being spent on it from a government perspective (I don't think that's what you mean though). We are uniquely positioned to be a global leader in renewables, both in terms of energy production as well as manufacturing all the components that go into it. Yes, there are elements of mining that are also required - industries that already exist, yet most of the focus is on shitty coal mining and propping big polluters up. We have every single element to be at the forefront of this market. This has every chance to make our poorest areas significantly wealthier, and create tens of thousands of secure, well paying local jobs across dozens of fields and industries as well as revitalize our massively under There aren't many investments that any government can make that are going to have anywhere near the returns that QLD is looking at - and a decent amount of this funding is coming directly from a very modest tax mining companies. Voting against this plan is literally taking money away from the regions and giving it straight to coal companies on multiple fronts - which largely gets sent overseas instead of contributing to the areas they're extracting the resources from.
86. We have preferential voting. There's nothing stopping you putting greens 1st and labor 2nd.
87. https://www.qao.qld.gov.au/reports-resources/reports-parliament/reducing-serious-youth-crime#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20young%20people,to%2010%2C304%20in%202021‚Äì22.
88. This is the way all crime and cases are reported on, not just youth crime. It‚Äôs why police are intent on getting you to drop or close the case so they don‚Äôt have to do work on it and it doesn‚Äôt impact their numbers/KPIs.
89. I agree with you here. People say all sorts of shit about the Greens based on what they hear in the media, then when called on it they usually come up with nothing.
90. What cuckservatives call ‚Äúred tape‚Äù I call ‚Äúnot treating your workers like disposable garbage or possibly maiming/killing them‚Äù and ‚Äúnot maximising profit at the expense of everybody else as well as future generations.‚Äù What cuckservatives call ‚Äúunion grift‚Äù I call ‚Äúlooking after the working class‚Äù
91. Well, Katter tabled a bill amendment‚Ä¶. So, I take it there is no actual evidence of them saying that then, and reddit is just a propaganda echo chamber? Because; that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs looking like.
92. Thanks. I hadn‚Äôt seen that first link, I‚Äôd like to see what he exactly said though, not just a few random quotes to fit a narrative. Though, I would believe Katter would do away with abortion laws if he could. I support pro-choice, but I do not like that but happens. And I‚Äôm not religious. As for the second link, that was his position earlier this year, and the bill he put to parliament back in May(?).
93. Thanks. The LNP though?
94. I‚Äôve googled for a long time. I see a lot of out of context quotes and insinuations. I‚Äôm yet to see anything that shows the LNP wanting to ‚Äúban abortions‚Äù. Could you link one for me if you know where they are?
95. You'll understand why in less than 48 hours. Bookies know what they're doing
96. Hmm, who was right then champ?
97. I‚Äôve already voted and didn‚Äôt vote LNP - so what now? And even if I had, this elitist pompous attitude is exactly what‚Äôs wrong with today. You aren‚Äôt better than someone because of an opposing political view. Your ad hominem is pretty standard on here for people not fully agreeing with every single ALP shill point of view though. Your stats are based around a unionised workforce strongly aligned with ALP and who have a keen interest to make their KPIs look better than reality as well. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôd all trust mining and environmental data coming from a LNP aligned source, right? Good one.
98. Comparing the multibillion dollar energy grid, (you can‚Äôt ‚Äúrip out renewables‚Äù either) to a $15m lunches program. You are the exact type of naive voter the majors play on because your vote is so cheap to buy‚Ä¶.
99. The evidence is in past performance, with sneaky bills passed in late night sittings.
