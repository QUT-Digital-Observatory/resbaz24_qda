Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. I'd like to say something nice in defence of Elimbah, but as a former resident of Beerwah, meh. I haven't seen the plans for a western route though, and i can't see how going through elimbah would be at risk, just from general knowledge of the area. Have you got a link to the stage 4 route you mention so i can look at it and potentially laugh?
2. Oh those 50c fares are gone come March, he only agreed to keep them going for the trial period
3. Sex offender registery
4. That’s becoming the Family First / One Nation base these days. LNP adopted all of Labor’s positions on the moral issues, so it’s only business/property owners in their camp now.
5. I’m also a nurse, but some comments here are a big exaggerated. The bachelor is $28,000 at three major QLD unis. Administration staff that are on a casual rate, and are beside admin/clerks are on $38 per hour. This drops when they loose their casual rate, and these are the cohort most at risk of contract losses with healthcare funding cuts The whole “Nurses experience more occupational violence than prison guards and police officers” was a play on technicalities by some ACN professor who says that because nurses get assaulted in their workplace, they get assaulted more than police. This is because police don’t work in their office, so when they’re in the streets, it’s not “occupational violence” according to her
6. Heaven forbid you vote for someone known to your community to represent them.....
7. That's why that dodgy prick is still the mayor of the Gold Coast
8. And apparently there is a lot of us in the silent majority! If your life revolves around getting so bent out of shape about politics and getting involved in the tribalism of it, then you are being played by the media and social media companies who are leading you down a path for what reason? So you can all get together and band behind a “team” and ignore what’s really happening in the real world? Live your life, respect we won’t all agree all the time. OP asked an opinion, people give it then others try and tear them down for their opinion. A clear majority voted for the LNP because they wanted change, let’s get behind them and hope they do what they said they will. If they do it then Queensland will be all the better for it. If they don’t they will be removed at the next election… I voted for them because of: 1 - Crime, they have ideas to improve it and the softly softly approach isn’t working. And I’m sure you would all have different opinions if your house got broken into and someone wielded a knife at you or a family member while you were sleeping. It’s gotta stop, the socialist approach isn’t working. 2 - Waste, they believe they can cut government waste. Look into the deals between unions and the government that the CFMEU issues have shed a little light on. We are all paying for these blowouts and sweetheart deals. Government should respect our money
9. I was fortunate enough to have been exposed to a politically engaged and socially aware head teacher that taught us to take note at a local, state, federal and global level. News sources (print local and international) and their ownership were scrutinised regularly to identify reporting bias. Mind you my early eduction took place in Europe and not in Oz; however I was publicly schooled. This raised a level of awareness in us that I think is missing from Oz school education. We prefer religious education over creating a mind that is politically engaged. When I came over here, much to my dismay, people could not even tell part local, state and federal politicians, portfolios, areas of responsibility, let alone their policies. My first GF voted on the criteria of personality when having met the candidate at Shopping centre. WTF!
10. Springwood electorate, I see
11. Is this Mick? I’ve met him many times and he seems like the guy you’re describing. He’s quite a slimy character and it always seemed like his electorate officer was doing all his work for him. She was always so tired. He also kicked me out of his YAC because I dared ask why he wouldn’t give nuclear a proper look. He quickly shut me down by the way with “we don’t need it” and “it’s too dangerous”. Tbf I also contacted his electorate about the Voice, asking if they’d consider telling the feds to hold off on the referendum seeing how the polls had slumped. I also asked them if they could instead first legislate it and show the public how it works (because people needed to see if it would actually work before entrenching it in the constitution).
12. I didn’t vote LNP, but I definitely want to see the Trad report released. I was hoping for a hung parliament, to be honest, hoping to see some of the line-skirting politicians hung out to dry. Liberal and Labor run a protection racket for each other anyway though, so I don’t hold out much hope.
13. Who is this person?
14. You’re a teacher who genuinely believes the LNP are going to improve public education?
15. I’m a nurse, also burnt out beyond belief. No wat I’d vote LNP though..
16. The LNP will definitely help you with your burnout when they sack you. Hope unemployment makes you feel loads better about jailing kids and taking away the bodily autonomy of millions of QLDers.
17. > The LNP’s document, on the other hand, focuses on helping teachers. Did it? Can you link to any part of it that actually had that focus? > The LNP government might backfire, but for my personal circumstances it was the best vote for me. Well y'know, except that even if they are good in this area like you think, they can absolutely fuck you in so many other regards?
18. This is spot on +++. Retake the classrooms and stop blaming teachers for behavioural problems.
19. That's funny
20. Yep fuck Labor the way they completely locked the gates, only other state that was worse was that other labor fucker in WA.
21. I don't think so as the last state election was right after some lockdowns and the NO DANCING. I expected a blue sea that election and was gobsmacked.
22. I do not know why any politician would chase the Olympics, it must be an ego trip for them and it just shows how stupid they are to think it will be their legacy or that they will still be in power to open the Olympics. Even if it was a good idea for the long term future, the short term pain (during their 4 year term) kills business and employment in the property areas that need to be developed for stadiums, creates business opportunities and profits for overseas owned entities and the people they bring in. Increases the price of housing due to market speculators and that is the real legacy. Who benefits from that? The glory of being the leader during the Olympic games goes to their successors or the other side of politics being in power by the time the Olympics games arrive.
23. Again we have recent historical evidence that switching to LNP to punish labour is worse. And there is no evidence that they will be better this time.
24. Why would you HATE people being clear in their values and beliefs? Left and right actually means something - it's not just a sports team. If you are fundamentally a compassionate person who believes in social justice, equitable division of resources and opportunities - then you are left wing and therefore will always vote left. It doesn't make sense that somebody's core values completely invert every four years.
25. conservatives when their quality of life worsens after voting for a party that wanted to make it worse https://preview.redd.it/7bfpneq0ycxd1.jpeg?width=797&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21c80be2401b8ee3237fc399a8dc95eda4872e50
26. As someone who has worked in labs, that would have happened regardless of who was in Government. Steven Miles is not standing there reviewing laboratory testing standards.
27. Holy shit yes
28. Gimme some keywords, I'm ready for a Google spiral
29. > I like some policies on both sides What LNP policies do you like?
30. You mean once the media stops using outlying cases to stir up the community. I wish people would actually look at what actually works and understand that simplistic solutions don’t solve complex problems. No matter how many times criminologists explain that harsher punishments don’t reduce crime rates,people still embrace this simplistic, disproven and expensive solution. Sadly people seem more focussed on punishing “ bad people” than actually reducing crime. They are so conditioned to see genuine solutions as being “ soft on crime. Yet time and time again we see the kind of reactionary, simplistic solutions that people embrace when they feel scared and powerless, simply create more isolated, angry, disenfranchised people who take out their rage on society.
31. Except it means kids are fed. Arguably one of the best uses of gov money there is tbh. A startlingly large number of kids go to school with no food, which given how rich a society we are should never happen.
32. misguided brother the policy was prep to grade 6, and ABS census data says there is about 329,311 children in QLD in that age range, per year to feed each child it was estimated at $1,600, that's a little over 500mil a year. Where the hell did you get 2b+ a year ? it's really too bad they didn't feed you during that instrumental time of mental development.
33. It’s less “wasted” than plenty of things the government spends money on. I for instance would rather spend money on feeding kids than building sports stadiums or aspects of defense spending. I don’t even have kids and can absolutely understand the powerful benefit that it would have across wild at all levels. It’s the sort of spending that is absolutely up flowing. It’s money going to Australian farmers and food produces, and into schools and school communities and has such a massive positive benefit across all levels of the state. Add to that all the saved household labour and stress reduction for every working family. All of which flows into increased productivity. Better education. Happier, healthier communities.
34. ? Katter himself went on record yesterday saying he will put it to parliament
35. You must be male. 4 years being denied access to healthcare is a bit of a big deal to those of us whose lives are at risk. Glad you’ve got the luxury of not being affected. Must be nice to be a human being!
36. I think the inability of either party to really tackle domestic violence is a long-standing issue in Australia. How is the LNP going to address youth crime with harsher penalties if we haven’t been able to address violent crime and DV assaults by adult offenders with existing penalties.
37. Men are murdering us daily in DV cases and people are more concerned about the steadily declining numbers of opportunistic teenagers “breaking in” to houses with no fences or gates or even locked doors… Awesome, yeah cool. The beaten up Ford Territories of Pallara definitely have more value than our lives. Gotta protect that shit, but let’s force women to carry pregnancies for men who’re killing us.
38. The problem is that prisons Australia wide are overcrowded and no government has a solution to that problem. There aren't enough screws to guard the places we already have, corrections is an absolute dogshit career choice, and a quick Google search confirms it's the same in Queensland. Part of the reason why so many criminals are just let back out on the street is there is absolutely nowhere to put them in the system. The LNP won't fix this.
39. Yet they have more support for things that actually address the cause of crime and lower it? Ultimate power for sentences really sits with judges anyhow. It's also been proven time and time again that harsh reactionary "solutions" like tougher sentences don't improve crime stats, they can even make it worse as you disenfranchise more people.
40. So you're just going to ignore the overwhelming amount of evidence that shows being "tough on crime", does literally nothing to actually reduce crime or do anything at all to deter it?
41. Yes, dump all the kids in adult prisons and create future criminal for the future. Then what?
42. Understandable but also sad. There's not a lot that the state government could have done about those issues. The Miles government was actually doing way more on that front than LNP with all the benefits from the coal royalties bringing in 50c fares, $1k off energy bills, school lunches and more.
43. What do the LNP build except roads? I mean, roads are nice, but they are allergic to doing anything else except selling everything that isn't nailed down to the private sector.
44. The privatisation of state assets has largely been a disaster for this country, why would state controlled assets be a bad thing? All the private sector has done for me in my life when it comes to most services is price gouge and fuck me.
45. > .... This is dangerous territory, expanding the role of government significantly out of the bounds of where it should be. The policy intent is a good one but the actual outcomes of these types of policies is the opposite. This announcement made voting LNP a no-brainer for me. Well just look at the super profit businesses that drive inflation up and cost of living up eg, banks. When the financial crisis threatened to I'll them, the government guaranteed them and they went on a spending spree to buy other debt as a gamble to make more profit when the crisis was forgotten, because everyone has short memory for that stuff. The government stepped in, but they should have bought in and then they would have that power to hold mortgages and lower interest rates. What did that Government guarantee get us? Nothing... here we are with banks complaining that they are waiting for the Reserve Bank to lower the cash rate, while they are secretly enjoying the profits from the percentages they retain above and beyond what they need to be some of the most profitable business in the world. What is wrong with a government owned business that builds houses and offers mortgages? It could still make profits to be used for general works, keep personal income tax a bit lower
46. Correct me if I am wrong, but wasn't stamp duty already removed by QLD Labor for first home buyers? Or at least increased the limit at which it would not apply? LNP policy as you have written it sounds like less of an improvement, or at least superfluous. Again, I could be misunderstanding so please don't take this as an attack ha.
47. Either and if they did and I found out I would wipe them.🤣😂
48. Does he have his own business where he has to pay people minimum wages and provide them with safe working conditions?
49. you'll fit right in with the LNP if you live your life according to spite
50. I wonder how many people vote purely out of spite.
51. A quick tl;dr is that we had a party in power that was v similar to Corbyn era Labour, ala actually implementing policies and programs that helped people. They copped the blame for issues that are happening globally at the moment as the root cause is neo liberal bullshit, not something they personally implemented. As a result we effectively voted in someone that would make Farage and Johnson recoil and hit them with the "that's a bit much, isn't it?", they were voted in by basically all the same nonsense reasonings and justifications for Brexit and will likely be just as damaging as it was.
52. Yeah, sometimes when I think life is getting a bit too stagnant I like to hobble myself, keeps things fresh and introduces a whole new element of danger and excitement to my life!
53. He needed to be marketed as Premier S.Miles 😊
54. Sorry I voted for liberal not labour
55. I hope LNP gets more houses built. Just don't see it happening- their voter base benefits from scarcity of housing.
56. It's a shame unions get blamed for housing shortages when it's nothing of the sort. Big commercial builds, yes, but It's more about big developers and unions fighting over who keeps what share of the profit.
57. https://online.lnp.org.au/news/securing-qld-housing-foundation Link to their policies.
58. Neither the LNP nor Labor will touch housing so long as homeowners are such a powerful voting block.
59. This is literally a chance for it to not be an echo chamber. Where are all the LNP supporters from the threads over the last couple weeks? It's a chance to answer the question.
60. Yeah no shit, they are asking why they think the one is best for the state though.
61. A stupid answer to a very simple question.
62. I'm a die-hard lefty, and I can't believe you got downvoted for this very reasonable take, lmao.
63. I'm in Clayfield too, voted exactly the same as you for same reasons.
64. >despite both major parties committing to not making any policy changes in that space early on Ah cool so it's all fine as long as they don't make changes to women's healthcare today, just wait a bit? Ladies we've all got 9 months to have a safe pregnancy with full medical care. No need to worry, the guy who said abortion is the biggest human rights crime has definitely changed his mind, as has the party who voted to keep it a criminal offence 6 years ago. Robbie Katter isn't going to bring a vote on abortion as soon as possible. He just launched a scare campaign for no reason with no intent to follow it through. It must be nice to only have to worry about yourself.
65. Except the “fresh” ideas LNP are bring to the table are actually all recycled from the 1950’s
66. What fresh ideas? Because all I see is simplistic disproven “ ideas”. “ Ideas” that police and health care professionals have stated don’t work.Seems like a cynical attempt to appeal to the out dated perspectives of certain conservative voters,in order to get voted in. Winding back policies that work because they don’t align with your world view, demonstrates a prioritisation of ideology over people.
67. But youth crime is actually trending down… Funny how LNP have misrepresented the issue and you all believe it…
68. I never understand this economy sentiment. Qld Labor's economic management has been literally world class. Are people blaming global economic issues on the party running a state government?
69. 4. Also UNIONS. The labor party policy being influenced by big unions, driving up costs, etc is rubbish
70. Oh the irony
71. Yes, the election was stolen..... I assume that is what we would have been hearing if it had gone the other way.
72. That last sentence is not true. We were in a deficit with the last LNP government, now we have a 5 billion surplus. The dates and energy rebates didn't cost us, it cost big mining companies.
73. Idk most of the populace under reacted to covid
74. So what fresh new policies did the LNP bring?
75. I don't get the downvotes unless it is for the phrasing being unclear. But a few pretty horrific deaths from young repeat offenders offers a little recency bias. But unless both parties are saying to do something about it, that can be weighed on your mind pretty heavily. I argue that theirethod of stopping it won't work, but I appreciate the intent.
76. >You’re ‘friend’ is a dullard The irony is palpable.
77. Did the Miles government also cause property prices and cost of living to skyrocket in NSW, VIC, SA, TAS, NZ, UK, USA, etc?
78. It can be difficult finding well-qualified sacrificial lambs.
79. We had this in our electorate. I kid you not, the LNP’s candidate was the admin of our local Facebook Community Page. No other experience. She didn’t get elected…
80. That is pretty normal. A guy I went to uni with was one of the "young" whatevers (I cannot remember if it was Labor or Liberals) back in the day. They put him in a seat that was on the NT/QLD border. (I am guessing it was Mt Isa). He lived in Brisbane and had never even been to the place. No active campaigning. Nothing. The only thing that ever came from it was ABC radio caught wind of it and gave him a call, and he said his one policy was he would move to the region if he won. He was banned by <whatever party> for doing anymore press.
81. They can put it on their resume?
82. Say it again son
83. They are liberal, but not in the way people think liberalism is. They support deregulation and freedom of business and the economy through lower taxes, privatisation of public assets, cutting red tape, cutting public spending etc…. But because this platform isn’t enough to get elected on its own, they have a cosy relationship with the national (country) party, which brings with it some nasty conservative religious values. But yes they are not the pro-gay, pro-abortion and pro-rights “liberals” of America.
84. I get the whole tribalism thing but how do people associate with words and not at least understand the team they're part of. Better yet, why are people superficial enough to fall for voting for just words and not the ideas behind the parties? Like do they think that voting Labor means they have to do more work? Are they not voting greens because they're skin isn't green? Democracy is great and all, but we need a better system that doesn't turn to fascism where people aren't voting with zero information or critical thinking in their brain. We're in the information age but somehow that information is repetitive familiarisation advertising and smear campaigns rather than explicit policy explanations and decisions. The closest we've had in the last year was the HAFF discussion and the only reason that got any news coverage was because they could use it as a wedge.
85. The only thing the LNP are liberal with is the truth.
86. Good god their poor clients
87. They have a liberal wing and a conservative wing, if you look hard enough you can see the divide especially between say Birmingham and Dutton or Turnball and Abbott.
88. they are liberal. unfortunately american brain rot and social media has spread the uniqely north american definition of liberal here. liberal means centre-right in most of Europe and Asia too
89. The first time I voted I got mixed up with ALP and LNP 🙃 every year I second guess myself, I wish labour would just show as labour on the ballot paper, no acronyms please
90. There could be some truth to that. Labor seems to be rather authoritarian these days. Federal Labor mainly. There’s no room for alternative viewpoints in the Labor camp.
91. Things that never happened \^\^\^\^
92. You had me for a moment ![gif](giphy|lzJ3EIs7it99W0FbKI)
93. Lol what!?!?!?!?! Did you hit your head?
94. It was Labor who gave Adani the longest royalty free period in mining history in QLD
95. I should add nuance. Mining company does not inherently = bad. But the Australian Coal Association and other mining lobby groups can get f*cked.
96. Frightening but nothing new
97. It's the most common reasons though
98. It's depressing
99. It's almost like democracy is a joke.
100. Ive been defending QLD as being a state full of dumbasses for so long. Now I think I've been in the wrong the whole time.
101. It’s important to remember for most people “politics” begins and ends at voting. Most people don’t have a fully fleshed out political view and they think whoever is in charge right now is why things are bad. My father in law only cared about the energy rebates but he still wanted an LNP win. He’s a smart man but apparently he’s will to take the hit if it hurts the people he doesn’t like. They’d rather vote against someone than for themselves.
102. sounds pretty qld to me
103. What's "shocking" about youth crime? I agree the other ones are pretty shocking
104. That’s what compulsory voting gets you
105. Unfortunately that's one of the issues is we have to fight a media billionaire and attrition fighting is their speciality. OP's 'voted for the cutest one' is exactly the people that need education away from political apathy. I don't want to stereotype but I guarantee if someone gave a single shit to tell that person about the LNPs policies on abortion rights, they might actually care. Even voting on a single well informed issue is better than 'who's the cutest'.
106. They didn't base it on Mile/Crisafulli, they based it of the electorate candidate
107. That must must be at least 2 Crucafilli's.
108. Crisa-folded up like a pretzel
109. I always preference Labor over LNP but how much a candidate can bench is as shit a reason to vote for them as voting based on looks.
110. My mum (now 75) and stepfather never gave away their votes. I remember asking my mum once, and she said it was “private”, and “a question you should not ask people”. As a mum now (of teenagers), I encourage conversations about politics, and the connections (many of which are invisible) between political values and people’s individual and social experiences …and between the forces (many of which are subversive) between political campaigns and individualistic capitalism. I want to support them to be good humans with a conscience and a heart…who care for each other and the world around them. (Needless to say, I did not vote LNP, so I’m also curious about the *actual* responses to this thread’s original question).
111. Maybe that's why i try always vote independent. that's how my family voted for growing up.
112. The LNP are the political wing of the Murdoch empire in this country. Simple as that.
