Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. You can call ‘bullshit’ as much as you like to any facts that don’t agree with your views. It doesn’t make it any less true. Here are some sources if you are interested in educating yourself on the topic: https://lawcouncil.au/media/news/punishment-after-the-event-rarely-works https://yac.net.au/2023/01/30/stop-youth-crime-get-smarter-not-tougher/ https://www.sentencingcouncil.qld.gov.au/about-sentencing/sentencing-myths/myths-about-sentencing-children https://www.justicereforminitiative.org.au/why_locking_up_youth_offenders_fails_to_reduce_crime_and_what_we_should_be_doing_instead
2. Yeah it would be amazing and we should be aiming to get there! There are plenty of studies in America that trying to mean test lunches doesn’t work. It’s more expensive because you have to process and determine which kids need foods and which don’t. Then there is the economies of scale that it’s cheaper per child the more food is made so overall it is more cost effective. Also these social programs have shown for every $1 put in, society benefits $1.50 by having more educated population, less crime, frees up parents making lunches, creates new jobs and businesses. Then the negatives of making it needs tested is that negligent parents won’t fill in the necessary paperwork and again the child goes hungry. Then the stigma for the child and parents getting the food when it’s only for the ‘poors’ would be so upsetting, I know I would rather starve then for people to know I’m getting a handout. There are so many things governments waste money on, submarines we won’t own or get for 10 years, fossil fuel subsidies, international corporations avoiding tax, qantas bailout to pay for ceo bonus. If all kids can access a healthy lunch - I’m ok with that.
3. We are both working on assumed knowledge of eachother here which I apologise for in my previous statement. You have no clue about my experience about this issue which is first hand. I’m glad you say you have some experience around this. I apologise I have made you heated about our discussion! Are you implying 20 weeks - (5 months) isn’t a long enough time for someone to decide they do not want a pregnancy? Implying that women are stupid? Given that it takes 16 weeks for very obvious physical signs that someone is pregnant. I am confused what you are implying. There may be cases of pregnancy in which circumstances are different, in the case that they are this is where policy should exist to fill the gap to meet circumstance. Thanks for your response!
4. The problem with law is that often times it can’t navigate circumstance, This is one of the reasons why judges exist but unfortunately they still aren’t infallible. I never once said that every late term abortion is a wilful one and as far as I have seen the policy is advocating against WILFUL late term abortion. Obviously a scenario in which a medical emergency like that is occurring the mothers life would take precedence? It’s a difficult thing to discuss if we compare this to the trolley scenario for example. Many people would choose the life of a baby over the life of the elderly however the circumstances regarding this issue changes and therefore so does the answer making it complicated. Great thing for you to bring up and talk about Thanks for your response!
5. I probably sound like a right wing nutter saying this, which is strange because I'm usually the one arguing against the right wing nutters, but these "facts" and "studies" just don't stack up to the lived realities on the ground. I'm sure I could take the time to shift though the data and see how they came to the conclusions they came to, and why the opposite is happening in my local community. But at the end of the day the simple facts are this. In the past couple of decades youth crime laws have been relaxed. Policy such as sentencing as a last resort ect which has directly led to an increase in repeat offenders operating with impunity. I don't have a link handy I can share, but those are the actual facts, free for anyone and everyone who wants to spend time in these communities to experience firsthand.
6. "Policy should exist to fill this gap". What do you mean? Because IF abortion is morally wrong, then why would any of the following make it right? The "no exceptions even for rape and incest" crowd, while reprehensible, are at least logically consistent. How on earth could you create policy around these issues that wouldn't be either prohibitively gatekept or meaninglessly accessible? *Thanks for your response!* * Some people, including multiple women I know, have few symptoms and their body doesn't change in obvious ways. I had someone celebrate our late announcement with us at 20 weeks, not realizing she was two weeks ahead of me. * Someone in a DV situation may feel unsafe to test, unsafe to share, or unsafe to terminate. It may take some time to feel safe to do any of those, and "this can't be real" is a pretty powerful psychological process (especially in trauma). * It may take time for someone to have the resources to have an abortion including time, money, time off work, transport to where abortion is available, etc. This intersects with social factors too, so "free services incl transport and paid time off" is technically a policy that could mitigate just this one. But seriously if your first thought about later abortions is "indecisiveness", and your subsequent thought is "implying women are stupid", then I'm not sure you're the person to bother speaking with?
7. I’m not doubting your experience, and other anecdotal evidence from people in those communities were youth crime is rampart. But the facts are youth crime as a whole in Queensland is down so the ‘relaxed’ rules as you put it is working. Now are there communities were it isn’t working, Mt Isa, Cairns etc. Yes for sure. Let’s look for evidence based solutions to solve these issues, rather than a ‘gut’ intuition that severely punishing these children will solve the issue.
8. Abortion isn’t morally wrong and never stated such. There is a difference between early term abortion and late term abortion. I didn’t think I’d neee to make that distinction to someone who is as intelligent and experienced as yourself. I stated that my partner and I personally believe late term. 20 weeks. (5 months) is morally wrong. As children who are born then are conscious beings and not a foetus anymore. And who are you to decide whether this policy can’t exist and that it will “gatekeep” people? Which is another assumption. I must have missed you adding Policy drafting to your list of “first hand experiences” lol Victims of rape, Health issues and I’m sure other unlisted problems deserve to have circumstance exist within a potential policy for these exceptions in a late term abortion Late term abortion SHOULD’NT be allowed to people who are simply just unsure and so abort the child. These people exist. I know from “first hand experience” Again English isn’t my first language so I won’t apologise you make silly assumptions about the points I’m getting across. Thanks for your response!
9. I'd love to hear of any ideas of how a policy could work, that would grant access in those circumstances (without being so open that anyone can simply state they apply to them, making the exception meaningless)? You say those circumstances deserve exceptions, and I'm asking how that could possibly work... Given no other OECD country has figured out a practical way of legislating those exceptions in (without sweeping "mental health" exceptions, which are very broad as I'm sure you can appreciate). To put it another way, who are you to assume it's feasible when nobody else seems to have managed to? Are you able to find any ideas, or just float "think of the babies!" imagery and argue with no anchor to reality? I'm not heated at all by the way, so direct messaging me Headspace's number... would be amusing, if it wasn't so disrespectful to the important work they do.
10. You seem to be assuming that women spontaneously decide “you know what I just don’t want this anymore let me go get an abortion” and I can tell you confidently that it isn’t a thing to get a spontaneous late-term abortion. As the person above said there are many different reasons psychological, psychosocial, physical, some cases are the chances of survival are slim for the mother or baby. The mother has to make that extremely tough decision and having people like yourself judging just makes it harder on women that have to go through with it, you can have your opinion but it’s still judgemental when these women need compassion in these situations.
11. Who knows, that comment about the probate sector could mean anything.
12. It would be *ideal* if they - fixed the 2 year lag on public housing allocation - granted tenders to flatpack developers to build more medium priced homes especially apartments -built over corner shops and train stations - built UP instead of out - join forces with Councils to resume land sold for development projects. Some have been delayed by greedy companies who just delay and delay with stupid excuses There is more than enough demand for everyone to profit and to ensure everyone has a home
13. https://preview.redd.it/7roo8evoz7xd1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=921d67757b3880c9536b4b5846092b57cfdd9d91 Basically, further increases in value of property in Brisbane (especially existing dwellings on large lots) as demand increases, decrease in value of property in the regions as supply increases
14. They’re scrapping stamp duty to entice first home buyers and replacing it with annual land tax. So take that how you will.
15. To be honest as someone who owns an EV, the LNP allowing the private sector to step in and build infrastructure isn't the *worst* idea. The government built and owned 'Queensland Electric Super Highway' of EV charging stations across QLD was visionary when it was announced, but is an absolute joke these days. The chargers are old, slow and unreliable, and due to the fact that up until recently the government only charged $0.30/kWh to charge there (less than half the price of competing charging networks) it's absolutely killed private investment in infrastructure because the stations cost a fortune to install and are already unprofitable, but then are also being undercut by the government chargers when they work. As a result the government has a complete monopoly on charging especially in more regional areas which wouldn't be a huge issue usually, but each site only has a single charger which means only one car can charge at once. The chargers are also broken quite often. All of this would be forgivable if they were still rolling out new stations but the network build has also completely stalled, 'Phase 3' which included important locations like Goondiwindi and Emerald was meant to be completed ages ago but many sites just never got built or are still sitting there waiting to be switched on. The government released revised timeframes for the commissioning some of these chargers before the election and completely missed the deadlines each time, basically they've just given up on it. The government did finally have a good idea and is rolling out co-funded EV charging sites now (allowing private operators to build them and the government provides some funding to assist with grid connection etc) but the rollout has been going at a snail's pace, originally all 46 sites were meant to be built by the end of 2024 but that's quietly changed to 2025, they're opening a site every 2-3 months which is ridiculously slow. The good thing is at least you can drive from Brisbane to Cairns now and barely use the government chargers. I imagine the LNP will stop the co funding progam and let private operators go at it alone - this isn't great either but better than the government pricing private competitors out of building infrastructure altogether. I hope the co funding program stays because it's worked really well in NSW (huge difference in infrastructure when you cross the border) but we'll have to wait and see.
16. I think you meant Private*, captain obvious 🫡
17. But also reflective of a likely broader policy intent to keep regions alive. LNP recognise they have a significant voter base outside of metro Brisbane.
18. Does that work out worst the longer you own the house?
19. Yes the result of this election is qlders voted to favour the regions over metro Brisbane. Whether that works out ultimately for the state is for time to tell
20. I would assume so, one off payment vs yearly payments.
21. I’ve been in the area for 16 years and seen a lot of growth in that time. Lived in the older Springfield and Springfield lakes, now living in a larger block at Camira. I don’t think there is any risk of flooding in the area honestly. I haven’t seen any. Nice area that’s getting busier. I liked living in Springfield lakes with the facilities they had there. Lakes to walk the dog around, tennis and basketball courts etc. Being close to the shopping centre was nice. Every suburb has its good and bad streets which you can usually tell after a drive through them. I love where we live currently at Camira. Nice wide streets on a 2000sqm block with lots of gum trees and nature everywhere. Still close enough to the shops and train line.
22. There is not a single home in Springfield/Lakes that isn't an eaveless concrete hot box of shit. If you "value character" prepare to be extremely disappointed.
23. The schoolyard's up and the shopping mall's down.
24. If you and your imaginary kids like community sport, it's great. I play for the local soccer club there and the facilities are gobsmackingly good.
25. If you like character look into Ipswich. Just bought an older Queenslander on 809sqm. 40 min into the city on an express train, have gotten used to the commute!
26. Make sure you include hail damage in your insurance quotes.
27. In Springfield Lakes, be careful with timber retaining walls. They were all built very cheap and many have started failing over the last 5-10 years.
28. We’re in Augustine heights. Have been here for a year after moving back from overseas. Happy to answer any questions. We looked at Springfield lakes as well. We love our area, not as busy as Springfield lakes, has less of a cookie cutter feel. The public school here is excellent. Close enough to the shops. I commute from goodna station so my train runs express in mornings and afternoons. So many sports and activities for the kids. Yeah all round it’s been a great move for us.
29. Also in Camira here. Looked at Springfield lakes and hated the small blocks and hot houses. Shops there are good, lake is nice. On 800sqm block in a street in Camira , quiet , well Kept houses /streets where I am. very friendly / community conscious neighbours - I’ve got all my small streets phone numbers and know them all by name. As always a few rough houses in every suburb. Easy access to the coast and Brisbane. Almost didn’t look here because I thought it was too far away. Glad I did - I wasn’t aware it didn’t have a good reputation until reading this post. But I lived in Riverview before that for 6 years so anything is a step up!
30. It is peak American suburbia. Lacks all sorts of good urban design. That said, I moved into a new development in Bellbird Park, (a couple suburbs over) and really love it.
31. If nature is your thing, look near Wacol/Sumner. Kangaroos literally chill in your front yard and jump on through it
32. Looks like you are after character, affordability and nature. Your best bet would be a rural town. Dayboro has some beautiful character near nature and is far more affordable than the inner city but you lose the ability to commute in under an hour. Compromise is the biggest word in real estate aside from another C word which is usually reserved for real estate agents.
33. I lived in Springfield Lakes for 16 years (since 2008) and loved it. I lived in the ‘older part’ of Butterfly Green and had a huge back garden - 800sqm so you can have a bigger yard if you don’t move to the newer part. The streets were clean and safe, I’d walk my dog late at night with no trouble. There were a number of small kangaroos and deer in habitat springs. The IGA shop is great and the staff are friendly - Moey’s butcher in the same complex is brilliant. The parks are well maintained and peaceful. The area doesn’t flood - you might get some overland flow during heavy rain depending on how your drains are. Make sure you take out insurance as the storms can be wild - I made an insurance claim due to the 31 Oct 2020 hail storm which peeled back my colourbond roof and crushed the car roof. Orion is fine - usual shopping centre ferals but never had any issues. I hear the lagoon can be busy but I never went. The Ripley satellite hospital is close by and was great when I had to go there late last year. I only moved as I needed acerage and I’d recommend people to move out there if they liked the area. Note that the Greenbank Army Base is close by and during wet weather they seemed to do some of their training exercises. It used to be much more active but now you I’ll hear the occasional gun activity.
34. Have you considered forest lake? It is a slightly older suburb, but larger blocks of lands, nice parks and trees, slightly closer to the city.
35. It’s a beautiful area. Property prices are quite high in the area but look, it’s the price you pay I guess for the beauty and quality both. It’s a nice area if you haven’t already, do come and drive around a bit. White rock conservation park isn’t too far and so there are many others on not long drives away. Springfield isn’t so bad with public transportation but newer parts of redbank plains which is an equally beautiful area if not more, have sadly very limited public transportation options. Property is relatively cheaper there than buying in Springfield but as I said you pay for the beauty and convenience of living perhaps is better words than saying quality of living.
36. Ohh this is close to my home town. My family live out there still which suits them with kids and working locally. Older Springfield has some more ‘character’ homes that are cottage style otherwise a lot is new build copy and paste. I do miss the ease of having everything I need there- good infrastructure in Springfield for bike riding etc and white rock is so close. Lots of cute cafes and all the shops you need in one place really. The commute can be a bit shit, it’s being a while since I’ve lived there but the centenary motorway is a joke
37. Property prices are very high for what you actually get. Summer is awful, everyone is on top of each other, separated by huge concrete retaining walls. It's mostly investment properties being rented out these days, and some of the areas are getting a bit "rougher". (No shade, I was renting there). I may have been unfortunate in my time but we always had issues with loud parties. Also, it's a bit of a dog barking nightmare (again, living on top of eachother). They are finally developing the roads but there is still very few services and very little to do. The main shopping centre, Orion, is always packed and after one or two visits, you've seen it all. There are also very few "restaurant" options that aren't takeaways/fast food or chains. I liked it when it was cheaper. Now, no.....
38. The community is pretty good, really upgraded a lot in the last 10 years. It really depends where your work is. It's a bit of a secluded community, so sorta stuck there a lot
39. Look in Moorooka area for old style houses
40. Just watch out for Bart, he's a trouble maker
41. Don't they get some pretty severe storms out that way?
42. It's boring. Look up north in Kallangur, there are many scenic spots speard out to Sunshine Cost for you to explore. And 15'-20' drive to the beach.
43. Shit It's sandwiched between Ipswich and Greenbank. Fucking hot or fucking cold. Three decent weeks a year where it's not either of them. On the storms, just remember that hundreds of houses got storm damage when giant hail punched through the rooves and they got destroyed inside. I'd catch the train because the Centenary Highway is clogged every weekday. Dopey designers force both lanes into one, it's not like there wasn't enough width to include the merge if they thought of it before building it, northbound and nobody knows how to merge at speed.
44. If you like Character, close to nature, and good for familiy life, look into West Toowong or Taringa. Some really great pockets backing onto Mt Cootha reserve.
45. Thanks so much! How’s Camira to live and surrounded areas? Wouldn’t mind to explore other areas if we can get a larger block.
46. I second this. But a few minutes up the road in Augustine heights or bellbird park there are some houses with character. Close enough to Springfield lakes that you can take advantage of the outdoor spaces, but homes with character (and decent size blocks)
47. Or blocks bigger than 500m2 I’d guess. If you like nature look elsewhere, because it won’t be in your backyard.
48. The stray dogs go to the animal pound 🎶😆
49. Love that! I grew up playing soccer, so I love hearing there is a community there. My imaginary kid will be so happy.
50. Be conscious of the alternative name "forest break" 😉
51. Yep they often cop the worst of the storms.
52. Their budget is 750k. They’re about 1.25m short of the average house in those suburbs.
53. I really like it here. Married couple with 2 now teenage kids. We were lucky to snaffle a place during covid for a good price. The suburb had a bit of a rough reputation but I don’t really see many other than owner occupiers that are either retired or in the middle of family life. Lots of people that have been living in their place for a long time in our street. Which usually counts for something. My young fella loves to go riding around the different tracks around the place. We use the dog park all the time. The local bakery is top notch which matters lol. I’d highly recommend having a good drive around all the surrounding areas to get a feel for it. Some hidden gems around for sure.
54. What other areas would you recommend that has nature?
55. ![gif](giphy|l2JeiTF0X8uly3uaQ)
56. Sorry didn't see the budget update when I commented
57. Ipswich, Woodend, Sadliers crossing, coalfalls and parts of Brassall
58. In that price range? Not much really, and Springfield is closeish to some nature like White Rock. You could check out some of the older suburbs in the area like Collingwood Park and Camira, though they don't have a great reputation. Generally areas with decent nature around are going to be more expensive.
59. OP - this! Move to the inner city ring of Ipswich for character. You can get a fixer upper Queenslander in the best parts of town (Newtown, Eastern Heights, Woodend, Sadliers Crossing, Coalfalls) for your budget and make it a palace over time. Character and heritage everywhere. Way better than new concrete boxes.
60. Out of interest where did Camira get its bad rep from? This post is the first I’ve heard of it. I moved in 4 years ago and haven’t come across any issues, very friendly suburb from what I’ve experienced .
61. Thanks! We’ve heard that Ipswich has a high crime rate, and to better avoid. What’s your perspective? Would the suburbs you mentioned be a safer bet? We’re open to buying a home anywhere with an easy commute to Brisbane, as long as it isn’t a typical ‘cookie-cutter’ house and safe.
62. Grew up in Camira. It's always been a sleepy suburb, but never had a bad rep. Some of its neighbours, on the other hand.....
63. Probably, it's proximity to Goodna.
64. Lived here for 15 years and never had a problem or felt unsafe. Raising my kids here and it’s just like a big country town close to the city. Lots of fab people and honestly fine. Some interesting characters and some homeless in the CBD, but that’s the same as Brisbane. I had my house broken into in Highgate Hill 20 years and only time I have had my car stolen was when I lived in the city. These suburbs I mentioned are great. Go for a visit sometime and drive around. Just remember that it’s a country town and closes early - go for brunch at Rafter and Rose in the top of town on Saturday before driving around is my advice ☺️
65. And Inala and Wacol and Carole Park and a heap of other areas people don't often speak well of. I had an ex from Camira, she was awesome though, so yeah there's that.
66. [deleted]
67. Someone will try it on, either katter or a rogue super conservative LNP member. It's just a matter of when
68. Katter reconfirmed on ABC coverage last night he'd be putting a bill forward on abortion. He listed a shitload of infrastructure things he needed fixed in his electorate and STILL has time to push on the abortion bill.... It's not a low priority for him.
