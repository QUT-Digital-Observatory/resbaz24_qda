Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. The people of Mackay are clearly physics experts.... /s
2. "*Pumped hydro is the biggest waste of money. It is sooo expensive and only have a 40% at best availability.*" Yes thats the entire point of Hydro to be used when we absolutely need it, mostly during Night periods but can also be used during the day if required. Use excess Renewable energy during the day to transfer water from lower Reservoirs to the main Reservoirs for use overnight, they are very much proven to work and very much proven to be cost effective and overall your 40% availability has very limited truth to it if any truth at all.
3. No and as the news reports say they are in there now getting to work. How do you know they are not? Just sour grapes I suppose? Suck it up.
4. Scared people are the easiest to control - the fear campaign has worked wonders on you my friend. You did exactly what they wanted you to do.
5. Unless those people are children, minority groups, LGBTIA+, homeless or disabled, right?
6. State based petrol stations would a fools dream that would never happen and literally no government would ever implement it. Reality is that it’s cyclical and it’s lower than it was at the end of August.
7. The focus will shift away from crime to punishment, with the sky news talking heads reaffirming "they can't commit crimes in prison" and how brave the LNP is for protecting innocent people. Ignoring every factor that shows locking up kids doesn't work, that we're going to have people in their 30s who've spent half their life in the prison system, no education or skills to get themselves out of that cycle.
8. I can only speak for the are I live and work in. There are no houses. There are no shelters. There is no available emergency accommodation. But there are still millions spent on administrators. We need more accommodation, not more administration workers.
9. What will matter is the perception of crime going down. Murdoch and the majority of media outlets which are all pro LNP will slow down or even stop reporting on youth crime.
10. It was a bit fucked that they didn't even bother campaigning in any meaningful way in my electorate. Miles has already said that the goal of his time in opposition is to reconnect with regional voters to try and make sure the ALP serves all Queenslanders next time they're in office, so if they take that goal seriously I think the regions will finally be heard. Because, lets be real, the LNP doesn't really give a fuck about us.
11. I didn't say it.. they did. Did you not read?
12. Imagine caring about make-believe internet points and think that the number of those points has a standing to your opinion. How simple.
13. "Its only stupid, not smart." Yes. You did say that. Not that it matters, as I pointed out. "After coal mining is done." OK. "one of the avenues" Yep. Only one.
14. How do you know what’s inside voters heads?
15. Because it is only for night time when solar is not working.
16. Sounds like the Leftie folks in Reddit are monetary, social, electrical and environmental experts who will not have this monstrosity built in their back yard. How much is it going to cost again? How much sediment will this release into the reef catchments area? Not to worry though, My mate Dutton will show Albo the door next year and get our energy transition plan back to reality without bankrupting the country and leaving us with a failed expensive, electrical system.
17. Well, night time is half the day?
18. I'm really not making an assumption about how they work. I assume they are also working hard, just like the previous government did.
19. Thanks for the commentary, Your role as a LNP staffer is greatly known.
20. Nice. Hopefully switching off sky news gets all the stolen cars in my town back, and I’ll let my my neighbour who got stabbed by a 14 year old during school holidays to do the same. 😆 textbook scare tactics
21. No, especially them. Why are the people arguing with me having to rely on quite frankly, disgusting bad faith arguments and insinuations. It’s like you WANT it to be true or something, either that or you’ve worked yourself into such a huff and puff you genuinely believe it, which is a thing, my 2 year old does similar often. Nap time.
22. Yeah scrap all the admin roles, some of them will become unemployed, lose their mortgages or rentals, making them homeless… good plan.
23. Do you really think that people in the regions experiencing higher crime rates will be that gullible?
24. So you think the "Making Queensland Safe Policy" is the LNP not caring about what their constituents voted for? Drawing a long bow here and definitely sounds like sour grapes lol.
25. That's not even close to accurate. It can run any time that it has stored capacity, concurrent with any other generation. The fact that it probably isn't needed while solar is working doesn't reduce it's availability. We already have several pumped hydro schemes operating in Australia, and we already know how they can and should be operated.
26. If you think the liberal party are going to spend government funds on taxpayers instead of their mates, I have a previously publicly owned bridge to sell you.
27. Yes the lnp cares greatly about the health of the reef that's why it wants to go hard on coal
28. Pumped hydro can be used at any time of the day or Night, With queensland atleast Wind energy generation is at its peak which covers the loss a large chunk of the Solar loss, If we subsidized home batteries and solar systems that would reduce the overall dependence on the grid as well.
29. As is your role as an ALP/Greens coalition staffer. Apologies in advance if it offends you that I have a different opinion to yours own.
30. Oh my poor scared lil friend - those things have always been happening. It's just that more people have cameras to record it now and Pappa Murdock loves forcing it down his disciples throats - fear not champ - now that he got the LNP in im sure we won't hear about youth crime again - like it suddenly just up and vanished.
31. Youth crime in QLD is literally at record lows, thanks to labour.
32. There was a knife attack in my town the day after the election. Why didn't the LNP stop it? Why wasn't it reported on television?
33. So these things have never happened before?
34. You seem like you might genuinely care about people. Wish you’d paid more attention then
35. Do you recommend that we should continue using public assets to pay workers in roles with extremely limited benefit? These workers likely have highly transferable skills and can work elsewhere, Queensland currently has low unemployment. I think an alternative would be lowing the amount spent on administrators putting vulnerable persons on an ever growing waitlist that resort to handing out tents for public parks and using that money using to develop emergency housing or shelters. I'm not trying to come across rude or argumentative mate.
36. Did you read it? He is changing to per capita rates going down. Which is what Labor's argument was the entire fucking time. So if crime in SEQ moves the average down but the regions they were crying about crime goes up, the LNP will still say the declared victory. So they are lying to their own supporters by backing Labor's original premise.
37. So if the wind isn't blowing and the sun isn't shining, and we have no base load power to back these renewables up, how long will it generate power for?
38. The majority of Queenslanders think they will spend our tax dollars more wisely than the ALP cash splash to buy their way back into power. The majority could see through the bull dust and freebies.
39. Subsidise home batteries and solar? 12% of our bill is all ready green initiative subsidies. You may be able to use pumped hydro day and night but not many before the water runs out.
40. No, they have a plan that majority of the state believe will help the issues and make them feel safe. No one thinks it’s going to be overnight to try and act like that coupled with your ad hominem attacks just shows you’re not actually making discussion in good faith. Yet another reason the good guys had such a great relationship result come ballot day. I’m quite excited for the future. And to be clear, no, violent crimes like stabbings and brazen daylight robberies haven’t always been happening at the rate they are currently, and the fact the state doesn’t feel safe is a direct reflection of that. I can’t imagine living life like you do, being such a main character that I’m writing everybody else’s experiences, values and opinions off as “Murdoch” 🤣🤣 if it was any less hilarious I’d feel pity
41. Violent youth crimes is at record highs. I don’t solely put that on labours shoulders but there slap on the wrists for repeat offenders certainly hasn’t helped, has it
42. I have no idea, the stabbing I mentioned wasn’t easier? Maybe under labor’s soft handed approach there’s so many they are no longer reporting it? What am I, your messiah?
43. No, they certainly have. Violent youth crime rising coupled with the laughable slaps on the wrist Labor had jockeyed had majority of the state wanting a change. I’m so confused at this thought process though it’s such bizarre rationale. Slavery has happened before, that doesn’t mean I’m okay with it happening and if it was for some strange reason on the rise I would be totally against it. Abortions being illegal has happened before, so I’m going to assume you were totally fine with the KAPs disgusting and archaic views on that?
44. Just like the other guy who made the same bad faith arguments. The majority of the state are just dumbasses who aren’t as smart or didn’t pay attention like you did, right? There values, opinions and experiences mean nothing, because they didn’t see things like you did and you’re the arbitrator. Spare me
45. Time will tell. Got to be better than denying there is a problem in the first place.
46. The exact stats of the Burdekin scheme were never finalised, but the short answer is 'a few days.' This obviously depends on what the demand is - how much of the NEM is it supplying, and how many other storage facilities are helping? Also, there's no such thing as 'no wind blowing' across the entire eastern and southern coast for any substantial duration. There is always wind somewhere - that is one of the major strengths of geographically diverse generation.
47. 120gwh (which is a rough calculation obviously but somewhere in that range) which would keep qld going a day and a half assuming absolutely zero inputs, in reality it would be longer because there is always going to be other generators in the system carrying some of the load (wind, solar during the day, battery's, gas peakers, other hydro)
48. The majority of Queenslanders have been told by the liberal party through our media that they will spend our tax dollars more wisely than the ALP. Actions speak louder than words. And if we're talking cash splash have a go at what the mining industry just spent to influence the queensland election.
49. Subsidizing Home batteries and solar reduces overall dependence on the grid which means less energy required during the Night periods, It would cost less then Duttons Failed Nuclear power plan which will only raise power bills if it ever gets off the ground which is highly unlikely.
50. Lol this guy really has been drinking the cool-aide 😆 🤣
51. Well you’re the one claiming to care about people, when the party you want to support is looking to ruin children’s lives. Cut down on public health, cut down on homeless support. May still yet repeal abortion rights. Will probably fuck with my rights when it comes to the BDM or healthcare access.
52. But the LNP can declare success on the metrics they gave without solving anything. Their entire campaign was on solving it not acknowledging it and doing nothing.
53. Geographically diverse generation is working well at Broken Hill at the moment. They did release the exact stats of the Pioneer/Burdekin scheme. 5 gigawatts x 24hr storage. If you want more availability then you will sacrifice capacity. So saying you can get 5 gig in generation for 24 hrs then need days to refill at which point you are not generating, or you reduce the capacity so it does not drain so fast. Either way you look at it they have at best a 40% availability as the reservoirs need to be refilled.
54. And for the cost of this 1 project we can have 2 nuclear power plants delivering base load 24-7 power.
55. Actions will speak louder than words. The ALP just learnt this the hard way. Second biggest loss in 100 years. Now the LNP are in. If they do not deliver then they will not see a second term. Did the mining industry spend tax payer dollars? No. ALP cash splash was with to be paid for with borrowed money tax payers have to pay back.
56. Our power bills are going up now under ALP's plan. Albo and Bowen saying they will keep power prices low is an outright lie and deception and will see them booted from office. Either way we go, power prices will rise. It is inevitable. It is a matter of will the system we get, be the best system into the next 50 years and beyond, and will it support heavy industry, manufacturing, green hydrogen production and data storage/AI centres, etc. with base load power. 100% renewables will not. Given the 100% renewables direction has no base load power, we will be hamstrung when competing on the global stage against our peers in these key markets. We need these markets here, on-shore for job creation and retention of technical expertise as well as a reliable tax base given there will be no coal so no royalties to rely upon. The simple truth is you can't run a competitive country without base load power. Nuclear is the cheapest form of zero emissions base load power.
57. [removed]
58. Thats your bizarre and twisted view of the policies. Do you think majority of the state view the proposed policies and think “ah yes, I want to ruin people’s lives, and cut government services.” No. It’s what everyone believes is going to benefit there lives and the state in general. I’m honestly quite shocked that reddit progressives are really epitomising the selfish trope associated with them it’s really opened my eyes, the conceited belief that majority of the state is wrong and there opinions, experiences and beliefs are totally invalidated and they’ve been brainwashed and YOU are right and the arbitrator of truth and reason is just insane to me. How do you navigate day to day life without constant clashes with people?? Or do you just live wholely within an echo chamber? Lmao.
59. They were not the metrics they gave the people of regional Qld. If they do not listen as per the previous government then I guess they will be another 1 term LNP government. Simple as that.
60. >They did release the exact stats of the Pioneer/Burdekin scheme. 5 gigawatts x 24hr storage. That was a wild guess based on almost zero technical review. It should be taken with a very large grain of salt. >If you want more availability then you will sacrifice capacity. So saying you can get 5 gig in generation for 24 hrs then need days to refill In practice, it's extremely rare to operate pumped hydro in this fashion. It's far more likely to run at much reduced capacity for longer (during a period of heavy cloud cover, for example), and to begin refilling as soon as there is spare capacity in the grid. >Either way you look at it they have at best a 40% availability as the reservoirs need to be refilled. That's a very misleading way of using availability.
61. Are you aware the cost of a single nuclear power plant in countries that already have the accomodating infrastructure to support it and how long it takes to build a single one?
62. Ummmm.... have you seen what a nuclear power plant costs of late? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogtle_Electric_Generating_Plant Thats 32 billion us (50 billion ish australian) for 2gw of power, which is not nothing but we'd need two of them in qld. Now keep in mind this in a country that already has a huge nuclear industry and experience. The Mackay hydro is estimated at 12 billion, it would end up being more because things always are in australia, but even if its double its still a good deal for 5gw of generating capacity. Plus we have people in australia that know how to build pipes and dams, so have a chance of getting it done in time.
63. They spent future tax payers money. They paid the LNP now to reduce their taxation in the future. I assure you the mining companies got their pound of flesh out of the transaction.
64. "*The simple truth is you can't run a competitive country without base load power. Nuclear is the cheapest form of zero emissions base load power*." The simple truth is you can't see that renewable energy can act as baseload so you force Nuclear into the conversation that won't be built/commissioned for 30+ years.
65. Barracking for a political party like it's a football team - my gawd what a sad, scared life you must live.
66. That’s amazing. I’m truly impressed
67. Look at it this way then. For the cost of this 1 project we can build 2 x nuclear power plants for 24-7 dispatchable base load power. Makes sense to me and it makes sense to an ever increasing number of Australians concerned with energy security into the future.
68. yes. Australia already has a nuclear industry and a world leading reactor and soon to be submarines. We have the experts and regulatory frame work, this just needs to be expanded on. Also need to lift the ban on nuclear power generation. If nothing else this will see the true cost (noting that GenCost is a bull dust saga and soon to be rewritten) emerge as private enterprise explores the feasibility moving forward.
69. P/B Hydro was original estimated at $12b, then to $18b and just recently they were saying $24b even before they finished the studies. Pumped hydro may have 5gw of generating capacity but only generate that for 24hrs before requiring several days to refill. There was a whole lot of controversy with costs here as Westinghouse went bankrupt during the process and had issues with the build contractor. This is not to say that we will not have the same issue but we can learn from those that have gone before us. Build ones that have already been done, "next of a kind", like the South Korean APR1400 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APR-1400](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APR-1400) and have 1 contractor to build from start to finish. And keep the same design in Victoria, NSW and Queensland. This should keep them below $10b/reactor. If comparing cost blow outs with Pumped hydro, Vogtle's 2 new reactor estimates started at $14b and ended up at $32b usd. A less than 2.5 x blow out. Now look at pumped hydro. Snowy hydro was $2b but closer to 12b aud. A 6 x blow out figure. Nuclear plants are very similar in design. Every pumped hydro will be unique and have many unknowns thrown into the complexities, e.g. geology being a big one. Snowy 2.0 is a good case. Also throw into the costs for pumped hydro, the cost for the wind and solar farms required to power the storage side of the system.
70. No they didn't. Where has the LNP said they will change the royalty scheme?
71. 12-15 years. How is Broken Hill running right now with no base load power? They are not. Wind, solar and batteries in the area which are more than capable to provide enough power for the town were shut off because the power companies cannot guarantee the correct frequency of 50hz to consumers without connection to the base load of the grid. [https://reneweconomy.com.au/broken-hill-has-a-wind-farm-a-solar-farm-and-a-big-battery-so-why-are-the-lights-out/](https://reneweconomy.com.au/broken-hill-has-a-wind-farm-a-solar-farm-and-a-big-battery-so-why-are-the-lights-out/) Renewables are reliable, not.
72. I voted Labor at the last election, political parties aren’t football teams buddy, you should be fluid and vote on which policy you like the most. Oh, and a key factor in that is accepting you aren’t a main character and that other people have different opinions, experiences and values. (This one may be hard for you, because you clearly believe you are more intelligent and important then majority of the state.)
73. Really, you’re saying that after the way you lot have carried on after the ALP lost? Look up the word hypocrisy for me
74. So am I, at just how selfish the users of this subreddit are. It’s insane how close minded the lot of these main characters are.
75. >For the cost of this 1 project we can build 2 x nuclear power plants for 24-7 dispatchable base load power. And in 15 years time, maybe one of those 2 nuclear plants would be ready to go online. Great success - except that both Gladstone and Callide would shut down long before, leaving North Queensland with a massive supply deficit for several years. To be perfectly honest, I wasn't a huge fan of the scale and complexity of the Pioneer Burdekin scheme. I think that a couple of smaller ones would be better, and I know for a fact that this advice was given to Labor government and QLD Hydro. I note that this is the official line the LNP have also taken, which I'm totally okay with.
76. Isn't Hinkley Point C in the UK going to cost upwards of $80b AUD plus the fact that they have had a nuclear industry sing like 1950. Double that would be $160b and I don't think pumped hydro would cost even a quarter of that. Plus we don't have a nuclear industry here so it would cost more wouldn't it?
77. I don’t think you do if you’re claiming it will be cheaper than the pumped hydro project, let alone for 2 reactors. Here’s a good example from a country that has had an established nuclear industry for more than half a century: https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/over-budget-and-plagued-with-delays-uk-nuclear-lessons-for-australia-20240621-p5jnkq#:~:text=The%20original%20estimated%20cost%20of,completed%20between%202029%20and%202031. On top of that, we also currently have no facilities or trained workforce regarding refining yellow cake uranium. No facilities or training around enriching uranium after it’s been refined to be used as fuel for a modern nuclear reactor. The nuclear subs will take 10+ years before we get our hands on anything at minimum, and the actual reactor cores are packaged, shipped and installed as a single unit by the US or the UK, essentially being welded shut and minimising the required expertise contractor work that will be required for that part of the build. Nuclear power plants are also more complicated than nuclear submarines to spite being conceptually identical, but I don’t see that being a major challenge we couldn’t overcome. Nuclear is viable for Australia, and I am for it, but there’s fundamental questions that haven’t been answered. Even saying that, it is a very, very, long term plan in the best case scenario if we’re taking it seriously and not using it as a political talking point like it’s current being used for. It also needs to run in parallel to renewables and short to medium term solutions. The time of getting one reactor built and running, and supported by the necessary industry the pumped hydro project would have paid for itself and then some, and is much quicker to build and run. We’d need to build the whole industry from the ground up before we can bring a single reactor online, and that will take at minimum 2 decades for Australia and tens of billions of dollars without considering the highly likely reality that it will run over budget and over time regardless if it had bipartisan support in Federal and State governments. Then for one of them to pay for itself it will need to run for another 2 decades on top of that.
78. >Build ones that have already been done, "next of a kind", like the South Korean APR1400 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APR-1400 and have 1 contractor to build from start to finish. Considering the last power plant built consisting of 4 of these cost 50 million aus, built in the UAE with (and I don't think it would be exaggerating) slaves. Now that power plant is 5.5gw so you could almost run all of qld on it, but its going to cost more than 50 billion aus to build it in qld with Australian workers. >ng $24b even before they finished the studies. Do you have a non paywall link to the courier mail article? > the cost for the wind and solar farms required to power the storage Well we basically already have to much solar, hence the price going negative during the day, this would be a great use of that. (And also wouldn't lose money during the day every day like coal does currently and nuclear would do)
79. Maybe they won’t. But my crystal ball says wait and see. I think it’s fair to ask why the mining companies have paid so much to see the LNP get elected.
80. "*12-15 years*." Thanks for your random number, The average timeline quoted by experts are 30+ years, a Decade for planning then two decades for building and commissioning. "*How is Broken Hill running right now with no base load power? They are not.*" Broken hill has other issues which aren't due to renewable energy, They lost the main HV powerlines that could of powered the town from the renewable energy locations.
81. Sure you did champ suuuure you did
