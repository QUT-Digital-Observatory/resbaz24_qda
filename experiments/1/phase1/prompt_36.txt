Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. You're confusing liberalism and libertarianism. Liberalism is a political and social philosophy that promotes individual rights, civil liberties, democracy, and free enterprise. On the other hand, libertarianism is a political philosophy that advocates only minimal state intervention in the free market and the private lives of citizens. In other words, corporations essentially run rampant. Nowhere in liberalism is there a belief that any actor gets to be so big that it creates anti competitive behaviour and dwarfs the individual. Liberals believe in empowering individuals, not on allowing corporations to run rampant. And cutting red tape is just code for Howard era pig headedness of not keeping corporations accountable for allowing negative externalities from business activity, eg dumping carbon into the atmosphere, where they escape the clean up cost of their behaviour and its effects are bourne by citizens and states for eternity. Liberalism doesn't believe in free rides for economic players.
2. So they're liberal, doing liberalism.
3. Except it was the Liberals who legalised gay marriage and Labor who opposed it…
4. Democracy is only great if people make educated votes. If people vote for parties purely based on tribalism, mum/dad, an ugly face, and not what’s best for either them or the country, then it doesn’t work.
5. I definitely think (& have for years) that political advertising should be restricted to their own policies (all of them not just the "see how good we are" ones) and no smear campaigns allowed.
6. There needs to be better political education school curriculums, unfortunately, what is actually taught will potentially be biased depending on the type of school = extremely problematic. I grew up in a staunch catholic family and went to a catholic school, but I somehow always questioned what was being preached, sure that wasn't greatly accepted but I pushed along. Why were so many people living so poorly when the church had so much wealth? A fellow friend and student was the perfect catholic lad, an altar boy at church, who looked at our religious upbringing as a social place of morality and friendship and gatherings. In the 90's he came out as being gay, he is still to me the same person and still a good friend, and living a good life. Honesty has always been the right policy for me, do no harm to others, help those in need, never take others for granted.
7. True. Access to an abundance of information is one thing. Intelligence is another.
8. Dunno what you're on about, I'm trying to get my Citizenship for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea because I feel like Australia just isn't as democratic as I thought it was...
9. If politics were based on logic it would be called. Engineering.
10. It's called Rational Ignorance. The average voter knows their vote is near-individually meaningless in a large scale democratic election. So people don't bother putting in any great effort into being informed about politics. Some voters do put in effort into being educated politically but they probably do so out of some external reason - like finding Politics interesting or entertaining, akin to a spectator sport. But they won't do so because they think that will increase the value of their vote.
11. Infotech and telecoms provide the means to have effective direct democracy -parliaments (talking shops) were introduced in previous times when the tyranny of distance obliged local communities to elect a representative to attend on their behalf.
12. And S**tF##kery
13. My comment was for sure an over simplification, but I’m talking in conversations where people are comparing LNP v labor and saying that labor is the conservative of the two because the LNP are liberal. Or arising out of a discussion about the referendum, the above mentioned lawyer seemed to think it would be obvious she would be a yes vote because she was in the young liberals
14. Liberal for business, not for social issues, where they're conservative.
15. There is. But Labor come from a union background - stronger together with a unified front. Alternative views are welcome with the camp - but in general they insist on a unified outward face. When Labor members say they’re working to change party policy from the inside, they’re sometimes criticised for not sufficiently standing up for their beliefs. But this is literally how that party works. And changing the whole party is (in theory) going to be more effective than striking out solo to stand and die on that one hill…
16. I like to think if I was going to make shit up on reddit I would put more effort in to come up with something more interesting than that
17. Tbf 2, 3 and 4 all apply to Labor too. It's only 1. that, in my view, is unique to the LNP in this case. (Youth crime was the only "issue" at this election that wasn't actually an issue at all. Labor doesn't have an equivalent imo.)
18. So, why did you vote what you did?
19. "Democracy basically means... government of the people... by the people... for the people... ......but the people are retarded"
20. NOFX said it best in 2003. There’s no point for democracy when ignorance is celebrated Political scientists get the same one vote as some Arkansas inbred Majority rule, don’t work in mental institutions Sometimes, the smallest softest voice carries the grand biggest solutions.
21. What would you prefer?
22. 4 people are idiots = see, democracy is a joke.
23. It was a tongue in cheek response to voting for the candidate that looked the coolest or cutest. Bench press numbers are not part of my voting consideration.
24. Times change, parties change, policies change - seriously get educated search and keep reading - learn how to think critically, we do not have to accept what we are given, eg; Greens "were once about climate and environment, animal/human welfare" no anymore.
25. That’s quite an absolute statement off the back of a real world example that IS a pretty solid argument against it. I’m not saying I support optional voting, simply commenting on the above. Should people who don’t even know what they’re putting on their forms be voting? It’s food for thought.
26. I grew up in the US and came here when I was 24. So I have the privilege (not the obligation) to vote in the US, and even now 20 years later I still vote every election as I'm a dual citizen. I don't agree with the compulsory voting in Australia. My husband, who's not American was always very supportive of it but we've been discussing more and more and he's now agreeing with my perspective too. In my opinion uneducated and apathetic voters are dangerous. People are too easily influenced when they don't care and are just doing it to avoid a fine. I don't feel it's an accurate representation of what people actually want and uneducated voters can be easily manipulated and "bought". Or they do stupid crap like voting based on what someone looks like ( as someone above mentioned their friend coding for the one who was the cutest). If people took the time to get to know where the candidates stand on the issues that are important to them, they wouldn't need "how to vote" cards. This was my first state election since I got my citizenship and I made my own "how to vote" card. For me. based on what matters to me. I took it with me and casually waved away the barrage of poll place volunteers trying to tell me how to vote and what matters to me. I said no thanks, I made my own, and quite a few said "good on you"! I think it's rare for people to care enough to do their own research. If you have the opportunity to vote and don't, then you can't complain. And if you have the opportunity, and want to vote, you research your candidates and make your vote count. I don't see how it's worse than making people tick boxes for candidates they don't even know anything about. Also, as a note, I voted in the US election already. And for the issues in the local country voting and state issues that I don't have any opinion on or know anything about, I just don't vote on those issues. I'd rather leave that part of my ballot blank than vote for something I don't know anything about. AND my vote still counts doing that.
27. The issue stems from a small group of people who can print trillions of dollars from nothing, and enslave the rest of the world taking their time and energy. Nothing’s going to stop that anytime soon. The compounding of interest means that it’s impossible to stop and will get exponentially worse. So why can’t we have a cleaner inner city and hyperinflation?
28. > but you do realise they are my family right? Ah. Good point. If you could maybe suffer a little bit too, just so its all kept neat and tidy. Like nothing serious, just a toe stub or something like that would be enough.
29. Does your family care how their choices affect you though? Nope.
30. hopefully she doesnt need an ambulance for the next 4 years
31. Thanks for your input.
32. And Murdoch famously hates Unions.
33. I didn’t vote LNP but I have to say the unions have way too much influence from what I understand. The amount of site walk-offs I’ve seen, the picket lines. Infrastructure in Australia is embarrassing.
34. The media didn’t make CFMEU branches recruit criminals and partake in criminal standover tactics you absolute thug lmfao
35. Most cfmeu members are traditionally labor voters
36. Yea they sure did - but that didn’t count
37. The first month Labor got in in 2022, mid June, they removed the ABCC, the watchdog for construction companies. 'We believe in "simple principles" like "the same laws" for all workers unlike the Coalition'. The ABCC had an over 90% successful prosecution rate against the construction industry at the time. >Labor has documented ties with the CFMEU, with the militant union donating $4.3 million to the party ahead of the 2022 Federal Election, which included $2.6 million in direct donations including for campaign advertising and $1.7 million through other means such as memberships and services, AEC disclosures showed. >Shortly after the election, the new Albanese government abolished the Australian Building and Construction Commission which had handed out at least $15 million in fines against the CFMEU. The CMFEU would go on to be found to have broken 2600 laws, fined $24m. Lawyers prosecuting the CMFEU and ACTU and investigators received broadsides from other unions, the firefighter's union. Anecdotally, one Liberal senator said that union workers hold sites hostage for pay increases. The workers tell managers that if management raise it with government and if workers are forced to work and forced to stop preventing others from entering job sites to earn where they picket, then they will intentionally break safety regulation to get the construction company fined, and intentionally build flimsy to have the building fail checks. These are the buildings we will live in... building future Australians will have to live in... the immorality for a bigger pay check. That lack of productivity comes out of every Australian's pocket, even the cost of living for landlords, driving up real estate prices and rent. It comes out of their own pockets, but yup they do get their greedy bag from time to time to cover it. Keep Labor's 4.3$ million CMFEU donations in mind when you hear him say to Dutton "sit down boofhead, I've got the call." He's more of a pitbull for unions than he lets on.
38. I think that’s what they mean. CFMEU traditionally pushed for Labor but now won’t, due to the recent debacle.
39. Unions stick together, do you understand how may people are union members in QLD?
40. Ah Newman, putting the n into cuts
41. Yeah my mum still has some trauma from it. She said they would get weekly announcements on Fridays at morning tea time and people would find out if they were cut or not. A bunch of people in her team either had heart attacks or mysteriously got cancer after a year of that stress… Also - the Together Union calculated last week that for LNP to make the numbers work with their promises, it’ll be approx 17,300 state gov jobs axed. Which, like Newman, will make the books look good for a hot minute, but then all those projects still need to be completed (esp infrastructure like roads) so the folks will get hired back as contractors and cost the taxpayers even more money. Is fucked.
42. I’m old enough to remember Joh, so I will never vote LNP. Campbell was a batshit crazy sleaze
43. Your comments are ignorant. Unions do have a place but I have first hand experince of them meeting at a maccas and saying stuff like "lets fuck them up" while planning work disruption, ive been spoken to in an intimidatory way by a union high up who wasnt even across the facts and ive had a union rep say no when i told them they should take the fight on behalf of an employee. Many union reps are great but your statements are ignorant to reality. Are you seriously arguing that the only people who get pissed off at union action are managers who want to exploit workers? Lol.
44. Not necessarily, he mentioned they were in HR so they're probably just in the meetings with no way to actually influence anything. So they just sit there and listen to the dickhead manager argue with the dickhead union rep. I've been in the meetings on both sides and can tell you that I left both eba negotiations thinking less of the union reps.
45. What is there to dispute about it?
46. Was talking about this with my wife before during dinner. I think Steve likely knew he wouldn't win this elec, and possibly didn't commit to any Olympic venue, knowing it will be the next govts issue. Is that super naive of me?
47. He is using the 100 day thing to not announce prior to the election Victoria Park. Which would alienated regional voters as 2-3billion on an inner city Brisbane stadium wouldn’t have been on message. The new report will mimic the Quirk review and Vic Park will be home of the Olympics.
48. Yeah, his position was weaker. I suspect the alp selected qsac to flush scrisafuli out. But he didn't make a choice, and got away with it. Being in government, Crisafulli will have no choice but to umm make decisions. So we will see how that goes.
49. I can't upvote you enough. Just fucking unbelievable.
50. I didn’t vote for LNP because they didn’t come out and back the Vic Park proposal. So I donkey voted and let the good people of QLD decide.
51. Well yes, Miles himself rejected the central finding in the independant review his government commissioned. He could have given the green tick on Vic Park but he chose not to. Also, I don’t have kids so free lunches in primary schools has zero impact on my life and frankly this policy was a desperate attempt to win votes from Labor. The previous government had been in power for nearly 10 years.. and they only release this policy on the eve of the election they know they’re gonna lose? Give me a break
52. Yeah fuck all those plebs who need public hospitals. Fuck chronic illness and cancer patients too - researchers trying to find cures aren’t entitled to a job! /s
53. Exactly.
54. The job position and description was not an entitlement. We are talking about the need for these services. Not the need to give someone a nice job. Anyway. Yep. Private sector is the go. The government is going to employ contractors now. Just like every time. Simple. Cost more. Can get a mates company to manage it for massive profit. And keeps the expenses off certain columns in the books. Contracting will make a lot of money. Liberal. Supreme financial managers.
55. hoping they don’t, but cursfuckwit has said the health care budget will be cut
56. Depends on the who. The management tiers are bloated as F. 'Healthcare workers' makes people think its just nurses and doctors but there are a LOT of leadership roles that slow down change/improvement and eat budget.
57. i wanted to start studying for healthcare but now i honestly don’t want too. i’m so scared that once i start there won’t even be a job
58. Surely not. I mean it’s probably not part of their plan to fix ramping and the hospitals by ditching another 10 thousand workers is it?
59. That is pretty much what screwed over Newman, so if he does it I would be surprised. But if he does, then it just shows how much of a dumb fucker he is.
60. I say 14,000 is a good number to let go . Hospitals here are a fucking joke. Privatize them and watch efficiency skyrocket.
61. If they do sack teachers, the school down the road will snap them up in a heartbeat. Same with doctors and nurses. These professions are not the people in the firing line.
62. To me public service contractors sounds more like those third party/ temp contractors call centres who take calls for Centrelink/ medicare, or temp procurement workers..because if it is, that is a cost cut i agree with. Hiring temp workers paying them pretty damn good money and then charging the government double or triple just doesn't sit right with me. Or am I not seeing the whole picture?
63. I thought government IT was already in the stone age. Feels like it some days
64. Not what I said but ok
65. I will be messaging you in 1 year on [**2025-10-28 07:32:08 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2025-10-28%2007:32:08%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/1gd4chj/positive_reasons_why_you_or_your_friend_voted_lnp/lu54f3b/?context=3) [**CLICK THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fbrisbane%2Fcomments%2F1gd4chj%2Fpositive_reasons_why_you_or_your_friend_voted_lnp%2Flu54f3b%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202025-10-28%2007%3A32%3A08%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam. ^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%201gd4chj) ***** |[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)| |-|-|-|-|
66. Sure it’s why he won the election … because decades old alp voters thought he had good vibes.
67. I voted labor too, but I wanna try and comprehend Liberal voters, since I think it goes a bit better than just being angry all the time.
68. Currently our "sex offender registry" acts by notifying the community if the conviction is for something along the lines of child abuse. It will be along the lines of "a convicted sex offender is loving in the local neighborhood" unless the individual consents to the confidentiality agreement in which case more specific info can be shared. Offenders are monitored and are required to check in to local cop shops regularly. Imo it's a much better system than the name and shame list that makes no distinction between things like public urination and child abuse. A list is only gonna make people targets and further endanger lives with no regard. All this info is easily found online with a Google search.
69. I have no problem with providing mental health care to children, or anyone. I don't know how you managed to mangle puberty blockers with mental health care. I don't know if you've been through puberty, but it's not optional, and it is when you really figure out your gender.
70. > what peer reviewed studies have concluded does This isn't true. The is actually a *lack* of high quality studies that demonstrate that puberty blockers, hormones or sexual reassignment surgery provide benefits to children. From the [Cass Report](https://cass.independent-review.uk/home/publications/final-report/): > While a considerable amount of research has been published in this field, systematic evidence reviews demonstrated the poor quality of the published studies, meaning there is **not a reliable evidence base** upon which to make clinical decisions, or for children and their families to make informed choices.
71. Voters pushing back against the left shows that it does matter what people think.
72. So that's where the coolaid went. You drank it all!
73. There is life long damage from puberty blockers, please don't think there is none. [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9578106/#:\~:text=Results%20consistently%20indicate%20a%20negative,boys%20for%20compromised%20bone%20health](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9578106/#:~:text=Results%20consistently%20indicate%20a%20negative,boys%20for%20compromised%20bone%20health)
74. You fuck with hormones at your own peril, or stupid parents do so at the peril of their children. Puberty is hard, but humanity managed to cope with it, untill about 10yrs ago. And read up on the damage puberty blockers do.
75. Could not be further from the truth re being “interested in public education.” It’s a stupidly complicated area of policy, co-funded with the Feds who impose their own demands, and it rivals Health in terms of budget.
76. And buy The Australian/Courier Mail
77. This.
78. The closed borders saved many more people's loved ones. Being upset about people being kept safe from a deadly virus is unreasonable.
79. I live in the next Suburb know the area well.👌🏻
80. Cheers. From checking that out, the two possible options they have listed for elimbah, the eastern most one seems mildly acceptable. But overall, that's just such a shit route for a highway, it's so close to the bruce highway already, it would have to go either under or over the rail line and it if goes between the rail line and the highway (which is the east) it will have the least impact on housing, but i mean. Old Caboolture Road there is super fucked, in order to convert that, they'd have to buy out a bunch of properties that live along there, and the grand plan is what? Let north brisbane folks get to the glasshouse mountains a little bit quicker? I practically lived on that highway for years going to and from work, that stretch from cabo to glasshouse was always the sweetest and easiest path. It was the gateway bridge to cabo that sucked ass.
81. I'm just reminding people it's not the end of the world Jesus. Does the idea of a registery scare you? Edit:Nevermind just saw you're a vegan
82. You and I are in agreement here 100%. It needs to be part of the mix. I’m not suggesting 100% nuclear but a decent minority chunk (15-30%). If only the LNP had not been so shortsighted in the 90s to do a deal with the greens to renew ANSTO. Who knows where we could’ve been with nuclear, especially considering that climate change was becoming a topic of policy discussion towards the end of Howard’s term.
83. So the document that showed that LNP had the least amount of material support and plans to look after Education, that's your evidence that voting for LNP was a good choice? Like this document doesn't show any actual policy or how they plan to achieve any of the things they vaguely offered support towards.
84. except I did, and 30 minutes before you posted this. Guess reading a document was too much for you. So I will break down the parts I like. sending students off to tafe instead of keeping them at school. Bringing back other disciplining options, so maybe Johnny who every lesson pours water on other students books, and jumps out the window to go jump into the class next door might actually get dealt with. bringing back meaning to assessment so I'm not passing students who managed to just write down what I had on the board. Maybe our naplan and A-C data might match again. How can we have 90% A-C, but then 40% 2 years below grade level in naplan. oh and no tolerance on violence, so When a kid takes a swing at you they get more than a 2 day holiday.
85. Nothing you’ve said contradicts. I believe that the majority of Australians vote with there feelings not with facts. You just said it your self, they aren’t voting with any sort of historical considerations or evidence and most don’t have any awareness beyond what ever single issue puts them for or against one party or another. It’s not values based voting at all and it’s super easy to manipulate. Which is why the election wasn’t decided by expert policy and research, but was instead determined by media coverage and slogans. QLD is a historically labour leaning state and the shift to LNP has usually been a punishment of labour not an endorsement of LNP policy. It’s usually followed by instant regret and then a fast switch back to labour. I am very much a values driven voter. I actually very much care about which party has the most progressive policies and am a “lefty” and a socialist. It very much bothers me that we have voted out a government making very progressive policies reality for a half baked policy platform from a party with a demonstrated history of being in the pocket of big business and whose campaign was financed by mining interests. And why? Because some queenslanders don’t understand how much worse it could have been under the LNP during this cost of living crisis. So yeah it annoys me when people who say “all political parties are the same and left and right don’t matter” don’t value the important role that choosing the better of the two parties matters. It’s very unlikely that the LNP see this as their chance to prove themselves good administrators for the people of QLD… they know they’ve got 1 term to ram through as many changes as they can and set up as much benefit for their mates as possible and pad out there position before they get fucked off in the next election when it swings back to labour.
86. Almost all of those little shitcunts were born to poverty-stricken parents who didn’t want them and abused them. It makes sense that people voted for the guys who’ll ban abortion, causing more unwanted “little shitcunts” and vow to lock up all the poor kids so you never have to look at the consequences of your own actions.
