Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Well I'll come back and withdraw my claim.shes being overdramatic when a bill is passed in parliament withdrawing her access to the contraceptive pill. What age do you think we live in that this would ever happen in Australia?
2. >disabled woman Yep, assuming genders now, cant be civil can you?
3. i mean the past few years has arguably been shithouse so i don't see how it can get any worse. i genuinely don't see how this will affect my day to day but let's see
4. He already said there will be no change!
5. Nope. You are wrong. But come back & crap on in 4 years
6. He voted against decriminalisation in the first place. His members - bar three of them - also did. We know exactly what he will do if KAP gives him the opportunity, and your disinformation will not work.
7. i was being sarcastic lol
8. If you don't even know what the candidates were saying during the campaign then how can you say anything with confidence
9. Oh so you've seen the new proposed legislation then have you?
10. What‚Äôs done is done, now. I really hope in 4-years time that people are able to call me a fool, and that I am overreacting, I really do. However, based on historical facts of the LNP, I don‚Äôt believe people will be afforded that opportunity. If you are on the side of the people trying to take away 50% of the populations right to choose (and the conservative nutters had their right to choose not to get abortions), then you really are on the wrong side of history, friend.
11. They didn't say they would put them in adult jails. But that's where they'll end up. Because we don't have the capacity in our current facilities.
12. Then why didn't the LNP rule out a conscience vote? If they plan to keep the current laws, a conscience vote is not required. This is a childlike attempt at lying by omission
13. Probably because of the Labor government being in power for so long? üôÑ
14. WOAH EASE UP YOU MIGHT TAKE MY HEAD OFF COUNT BOOMULA
15. No. It‚Äôs still between a woman and her healthcare professionals (QLD law requires two professionals to consult with her to make sure that it‚Äôs her choice and hers alone). Get fucked. And no babies are killed. Foetuses aren‚Äôt sentient. Science also tells you to get fucked. As a male, I tell you: fuck off. This is not our business. And it never will be. If you think it is, it means you think women are lesser beings. And that makes you scum.
16. I can't even fathom anyone caring about that with everything else being tossed into the election, what possible issue could there be with giving kids lunch ffs? Some people really can't see the forest from the trees.
17. Kids don‚Äôt break and enter on a full stomach?
18. Now kids will get three meals a day in prison üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è
19. Are you serious? A free lunch is the answer to youth crime? How ridiculous!
20. Not against this one bit. Adult crime adult time. But where does it end. The prisons are that overpopulated that they run on a in and out policy. For every person that goes in, one person is released. Depite the remaining time they have left. So what‚Äôs the answer, build more prisons raise taxes on an already struggling nation. Do we bring back capital punishment. Open more youth centers or bring in mandatory military service. There are so many options, but we live in a free country. Free to choose the life we want. Does that mean we go to a state of communism. What is truly the good choice. Education does work, but only if the individual wants to truly change. Violence brings violence, we see this every day. Personally, I have no idea what the solution is. Do we remove money or the concept of value. This brings its own inherit set of problems. Until the day comes where everyone is seen and treated as an equal, will it ever change. Even this has its own set of problems. The end game being someone will always want to be on top. It‚Äôs human nature. To be the best. I for one am glad I live in Australia you only need to turn on any form of media be it mainstream or back door media. It‚Äôs all violence, war, religion, greed. When was the last time anyone watched how a a common working class person who has struggled their whole life providing for his/her ( or one of the 130+ pronouns we now have) family who got cancer and beat it and is now a happy healthy person. You won‚Äôt see it. BeCause as a race we feed on seeing less fortunate then ourselves. It makes us feel better to know that there are people worse off we are so desensitized to murder and mayhem now. If someone can prove me wrong on this I am more than willing to listen. I for one would love to hear how it‚Äôs not true. Until this changes the world we live in will keep following this path we are on. Honestly how many generations are left to come. The way things are heading I see maybe 6 at best. We live in the moment and this is our moment.
21. It‚Äôs become more obvious because more people have CCTV than they used to, and we now have Community Facebook groups/ social media to talk it about, but that‚Äôs not evidence that it has increased. Yes, there are definitely pockets throughout QLD, notably Townsville, Cairns, and GC that do have greater problems than other areas, but on average, rates of youth crime are falling. Regardless, the ways that the LNP intend to address this issue will not solve the underlying problem so it‚Äôs really a moot point. Numbers may continue to fall and the LNP will take the credit for something they had no hand in. If you want to get all up in arms about something you should be looking more toward domestic violence, sexual assaults and murder of women, particularly by men known to them, where those rates have significantly increased.
22. This is a dumb take. The way the legal system works is 1. Person (victim) reports something happened 2. Police record this as a crime and begin investigating etc. Or don't. But this is when the crime is counted. 3. Try to find the perpetrator 4. Charge perp with committing the crime. 5. Court system. As soon as you get to step #2 it counts as a crime. The only potential crimes that aren't included are when (a) it isn't reported, or (b) it's reported but not taken seriously / police don't want to act on the report.
23. I mean the individual youths. Not all youths in general. And if the police are not allowed to single out criminals, that pretty much renders them useless.
24. Just because it‚Äôs not a problem where you live doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not a problem.
25. And that's how you lose an election. Tell people with real problems that there's no problem. Did you ask where they are from and what is thier experience before you told them that they are wrong about their life? Do you think that makes them want to vote Labor? I actually voted for labour but it's an arrogant tribe full of hate speech against anyone they disagree with and it's intolerant of different ideas. I voted for them because the government departments I work with are well run and their 50 cent transport policy. They lost and will keep losing while they support hate speech and intolerance of potential swing voters. That's just how marketing and psychology works. You can't insult people into supporting you.
26. Well come out into the real world and have a look.
27. There was footage of a meeting. Can't recall if money actually changed hands but they were doing deals.
28. No. Ashby desperately wiggled his buttocks and got Pauline to wiggle hers but failed to convince the Russians that they were significant enough to fund.
29. go have a nap boomer
30. Nah, but I'm sure it'd look that way to you ü§°
31. > Yes, but please remember that the gov borrowed to give the $1000 energy rebate Governments borrow. This isn‚Äôt news. However, Queensland has a balance sheet that makes it a non-issue. The state has many assets that return a good profit, resulting in a headline surplus after servicing that debt. Unless the LNP sells ‚Äòem all off, or we get another Bligh-style Labor government who sells ‚Äòem all off. > which means instead of feeling the pinch 3 months ago, we'll feel it in the next 3 years at some point Now that we‚Äôve elected the LNP, you‚Äôre correct. But if we‚Äôd stuck with Labor, that would be completely false - we were on track for a surplus, meaning that even after servicing the debt, the state would be in profit. Of course, that was predicated on making the mining companies pay their fair share, which the LNP has as a priority to reverse. > Both parties have been bringing in mass immigration to try to increase growth, which hasn't worked as they expected Both parties have done no such thing. The Queensland State Government has no power to control immigration one way or the other, both international and interstate.
32. I said down *across the board*. As in, across both short term and long term, and every category of crime.
33. Cool, like I said, do you have the data for that? Can you link it?
34. Let me be blunt. I absolutely will not say the criminal justice system shouldn‚Äôt play a part. The reality is that other agencies, if they stepped in sooner, with more support, could _prevent_ crime. That should be the goal. Prevention is 1000% better than rehabilitation. I have a problem with ‚ÄúAdult crime, adult time‚Äù because it‚Äôs undefined. But I don‚Äôt care who‚Äôs in charge as long as their youth crime focus is more about prevention rather than rehabilitation. I‚Äôm pessimistic that the LNP will even _think_ about it, but I sent DC my thoughts on it anyway. His speech said he would put Queenslanders interests first, so I told him that while I did not vote for him, I hope he sticks to that claim. (People who downvoted this: fuck you. You deserve to be victims of crime, because you have no decency. You think that instead of helping kids to not become criminals in the first place, we should indoctrinate them into a criminal justice system that fucks them up for life. Fuck you. Hard.)
35. You‚Äôre the one making bullshit claims though?
36. Privatise. Its the only way they can get kickbacks
37. They are going to sell all the public hospitals calling it now
38. we are all about to be in deep shit
39. Yeah, I know we've been drifting that way for a while.. but it's really gutted me lately. "Fuck you, I got mine". We might as well make it the national anthem at this point.
40. BRB, forgot to pull my ladder up behind me :(
41. Murdoch and stokes have blood in the game. Billions in shares. They also tell you what to think. And dumbshits listen.
42. This isn‚Äôt about race so calm down you believe in Adult Crime Adult time locking kids up? Some of us don‚Äôt race irrelevant these are children
43. Of course. Your feelings, fears and worries are totally valid and many of us are feeling the same way ‚ù§Ô∏è
44. > What age do you think we live in that this would ever happen in Australia? The age where we just elected an extremely regressive, religious party to government in a state where we have no Upper House to keep them in check.
45. My bad for assuming, but no need to shit talk me when I'm on your side üòä
46. Woman are the only gender who have ovaries.
47. What indicated I dont know? I know enough to say it was never on the table for the LNP, nor was it brought up by them. At this point seems like you're guessing a whole lot more than me. I certainly wouldn't support changing our current laws, but neither does it seem worthy of a protest.. protest what? Our current law.. its stupid.
48. If you re-read the comment it‚Äôs referring to the period before the Labor changes. Had first hand experience with a medically required termination with my partner, no one went to jail, nor raised any issues with legalities‚Ä¶
49. I refuse to believe there is more than 10% of people who believe its in society best interest to take away those rights. Regardless of political leaning..
50. I actually didn't care if Labor or LNP won. Fyck the Greens. I quite liked Miles and had money on him to win. So try again..
51. [removed]
52. The issue is that the cost wasn‚Äôt worked out properly - they only costed out the food. There were major issues with who would actually work in the school to hand out the food, given so many mums go back to work now and there isn‚Äôt that free labour any more. And how would the food be supplied to remote regions? It sounds like a great idea on the surface, but it‚Äôs not been thought out to the degree that it needs to in order to work.
53. > what possible issue could there be with giving kids lunch ffs? I don‚Äôt have an issue with free lunches. I think it implemented well could actually help disadvantaged kids who aren‚Äôt getting fed get ahead. Youth crime is not increasing at the rate the media is making it out to be, there is plenty of data on that already. Youth crime in general is a long term issue that requires a long term approach that might not solve it for the current generation of underaged kids committing crimes but it might help the next one. Providing food for those kids who‚Äôs parents can‚Äôt feed for whatever reason is one step closer to improving their quality of life. It also creates jobs for those in the catering industry to make food for kids. I don‚Äôt know what the LNP and Katter voters have against kids but they sure seem to want to lock them up while at the same time force unwanted pregnancies to create more kids the run through the system. Are these political parties being paid off by corporations like SERCO and G4S? Is this another prison industrial complex like the US and UK have been profiting off of for the last few decades?
54. Both those sets of problems can exist at the same time, be of concern at the same time, and need community measures at the same time. It‚Äôs not a contest. I know these problems existed long before we had at-home visibility, I was finding needles in my garden in inner Sydney thirty years ago. But for me personally, as someone decades married to a consistently non-violent man, I am much more likely to be a victim of crime from the local youth delinquents, and I‚Äôm not going to apologise for thinking that‚Äôs a problem I‚Äôd like addressed (although I agree that LNP aren‚Äôt necessarily bringing much to the table with evidentiary support at this stage).
55. I‚Äôm in Moreton Bay and we have more crime here and it‚Äôs to a higher degree. Somebody was stabbed to death in their house by teens only a suburb away. A house was set on fire in the next street. Teens are roaming the streets at night looking for cars and houses to break into. It is real.
56. What about the men who are treated the same by woman. This is not to dispute what you say. 100% true everything you have said. But it‚Äôs not just a black or white issue either. Crime is not race oriented. You can be any colour, religious faith, any sex or gender, any ethnicity. If you are a born human then you fall into the category. Why can‚Äôt people just get along. Why do we need to be better than the person standing next to us. There will always be crime. Murder, rape, theft, the list goes on and on. No matter what planet anyone or anything lives on. Should it hell no, can we change it, absolutely hell no. So how do we fix it. I‚Äôm guessing is to end our human race but that dosent fix the dogs or cats or bears or any other animal that‚Äôs walks this planet or any planet. Does it affect us yes. Can we live with it. I guess we‚Äôll have too. Should we cloud the fact that it exists hell no.
57. Absolutely they are rendered useless. Just ask the police dealing with this stuff everyday and night. And 100% not all youth are in this category. It‚Äôs like saying all lawyers are blood sucking parasites, but in reality they are not. Even the age old police are assholes. Clearly they are not, they just people trying to do a job. A job that everyone hates them for until they are the subject of crime. Then all the sudden they are the first person anyone rings. Tbh it‚Äôs a thankless job and for anyone involved in their lives. Bullying, harassment, reticule. choosing certain friends because no one wants to be seen to be friends with police. In reality they are people just trying to make a difference in this messed up country of ours. Like youth workers, doctors nurses, plumbers and builders and every other hard working Aussie is just trying to survive this country. It‚Äôs not all doom and gloom I‚Äôm proud to say I‚Äôm seventh generation Aussie. I love this country. It saddens me to see how fellow Aussie no matter what race, religion, colour or beliefs are too ignorant to see the problems in the real world and to believe what a poll tells them as gospel. To stand up against the powers that be that claim to be fixing our country. Why can‚Äôt a nobody be elected for prime minister. Someone who is actually living in the real world and dealing with real world problems because nobody would like what they said, that‚Äôs why. We have to be seen to be a thriving and prosperous nation so we look good. Dont get me wrong, its not just our country it‚Äôs a global problem. And we can‚Äôt change the world. But I would like to change my backyard
58. It would be nice to live under a rock. And as for the numbers. It‚Äôs easy to say when you only write down what they want you to see. And yes I do know personally first hand how the numbers are made up. Don‚Äôt look at the media actually go and live in these places and see it first hand. And to clarify it‚Äôs not the police. They are just as fed up with it as the the rest of us that deal with it on a day to day basis. If it‚Äôs not a problem then why are groups of people dealing with them themselves. There is no end to it because they know they can‚Äôt be touched. I truly hope that one day the comman person will see the actual reality of the world, unfortunately most of you live in a nice estate in the city and don‚Äôt have to deal with the real world.
59. I'm not even going to touch most of that nonsense but I'll stick to what I referenced originally: I'll 100 percent call out when people give anecdotal experiences some huge social value. Youth crime and crime on the whole is going down and has been for a while. In no world should that be a major issue at the polls.
60. The irony. How about you come out of your echo chamber? https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/100936
61. [deleted]
62. It‚Äôs just gross how American organisations get their mitts into everything that *should* have nothing to do with them.
63. That's even funnier. But yeah, I recall the whole meeting was covertly filmed.
64. The more you say it the sillier you look.
65. It‚Äôs straight from the qps regional data
66. He sourced them from here. Important to remember these stats don‚Äôt account for population increases. They‚Äôre simply numbers, not data analysis. https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/queensland-crime-statistics/
67. I understand and agree for the need for increased prevention effort. An ounce of prevention worth a pound of cure etc etc. Get no argument from me. But what about now? And what about the cases where the "prevention" doesn't work? People clearly (as evidenced by this election) aren't happy to have the legal system just give out slaps on the wrists. How many times does a person need to be in front of a judge, be shown the impact the crime has done the victims, pledge to be better and not commit crimes again, then go out and do it all over again? I don't think anyone would be against having leniency for first time offenders, but when you read some cases where the kids are committing dozens of crimes, how can the reaction just be "if we lock them up, they will just be worse", as if there aren't already?
68. I dont disagree with anything you‚Äôve said here. It absolutely shouldn‚Äôt be about punishment and it should be about prevention. That should come from the other agencies. But you have inadvertently stumbled on a failure of this government. NSW and Victoria have set up their social, justice and health systems so they can manage this exact issue how you are suggesting. Qld on the other hand has a rag tag bunch of agencies that are unclear how they hang together. Now, do I think the Libs will solve this problem? The NSW Libs did over the past 12 years, but I have no faith the Qld LNP will! But I also have no faith Queensland Labor would solve either of the current sentencing issues for high risk offenders, or that the will improve the system in the way you suggest because they are too busy with simple solves and announcables rather than real, proper structural reform.
69. We live in the best state in the country but man, a lot of our residents aren‚Äôt the sharpest tools in the shed.
70. Mate, you're the one who brought up race in the first place, not me. I‚Äôm talking about crime, plain and simple. If these "children" are out there stealing cars, breaking into houses, or doing worse, then yeah, they should face serious consequences. Just because they‚Äôre young doesn‚Äôt mean they should get a free pass for ruining other people‚Äôs lives. You want to treat them like innocent little angels, but when they‚Äôre committing adult-level crimes, they should face adult-level consequences. Age shouldn‚Äôt be a shield for bad behavior.
71. Get a grip and stop the fear mongering. The sky isn't falling in like people keep crying about.
72. The fact you didn't understand that it doesn't require LNP to introduce a bill for it to be voted on. The fact you called Robbie Katter "Bob" tells me you were thinking of his father. Your general naivety.
73. That's nice. Maybe you've noticed but that is in the past and had no relevance to whatever the fuck KAP is going to propose.
74. Given your stupid comments, I'm guessing One Nation supporter? High school education only. Some kind of tradie. Straight, white guy. Mid 30s?
75. This has been implemented in 400+ schools in the gold coast region. No one was saying a bunch of mums would have to do it for free. Every day care provides meals.
76. respectfully, LNP are pushing for abortion to be illegal and 10 year olds be allowed to be thrown in prison. A ten year old girl could be put in prison for terminating a pregnancy. let that sink in, get over the fucking lunch boxes.
77. Yeah, this is the criticism my mother in law has. She thought the money would be better spent improving education in general. I don't know if I agree, but it's a reasonable take.
78. they chickened out of abortion, that means they're scared of push back. keep doing it.
79. The Green's had a weird night - overall vote looked okay, but target seats ran away from them. I can only think that the Greens have turned off their marginal voters who went away from Labor, by not being willing to compromise on matters that affect the swing Green/Labor voter (like fairer housing policy, energy policy, etc.) Labor is far from guilt free in this, but if it's easier for Labor to steal your policies than work with you, something has broken diplomatically on the left.
80. https://preview.redd.it/b4p6o2or97xd1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aef84e2bdc1e14f375a0e3d92dd270bc3de274fa
81. I know it‚Äôs not a contest, however if people are looking to be concerned about issues and are stating rates of these issues as justification for change, then look to where the incidence is actually increasing, particularly when it as at such an alarming rate.
82. I am in Moreton Bay and I know the cases you‚Äôre talking about. Yes, it‚Äôs real. But where is the evidence that it‚Äôs to a higher degree. Both the police and criminologists disagree with you.
83. The problem is, youth crime is at a 20 year low. It's not a true problem, it was a lie told to bolster the political agenda that 10 year olds should be allowed to be thrown in prison.
84. And yes I know you will all be on here saying I‚Äôm full of shit and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about but it‚Äôs easy to be a keyboard warrior. Come walk a day in my shoes and let me know how you feel about the subject.
