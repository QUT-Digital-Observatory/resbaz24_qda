Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Because voters in Australia are politically and media illiterate. They don't have the capacity to read actual statistics from organizations who monitor things like crime. Even the Queensland Police say their own data shows crime is significantly down across the board. Also the cost of living understandably has made people angry, but again generally speaking voters don't have the ability to read into the actual causes of the cost of living. Primarily corporate price gouging due to the fact Australia's economy is in a stranglehold by mega companies that own entire markets. Like Coles, Woolworths and Bunnings for example. The QLD media landscape is dominated by the Murdoch empire who have always had an interest in LNP governments being elected. So you get media coverage of politics that is incredibly one sided with the intention of favouring the LNP. This all mixes together to create an environment where too many voters don't have objective information when they go to the voting booths.
2. Because people don't live in datasets. They look at what's happening in their own neighbourhood, and one or two bad nights in a localised area means it's a widespread issue. Basically, they can't think in broad terms. Confirmation bias?
3. I think the issue is that the severity of crimes has changed and the types of crimes have changed. And the age of offenders has changed too. For example. Years ago. Most 'Youth" crime was by 16 to 17 year olds. Not 11 and 12 year olds. YOung kids did not carry knives and machete's and break into peoples homes in daylight and kick doors down and "home invade". Just didn't happen. violence of crimes has definitely increased. Violence towards adults has increased by youths. Used to be? 15 year olds get yelled at by a grown man? They ran away. Now? They are likely to grab their knive they bought with them and try to stab them or attack the man. Years ago? Most cars being stolen seemed to be stolen by 16 to 20 year olds. Now it seems to be 12 to 16 year olds. Crimes against defenceless elderly? Used to be very rare. Now it's happening more often. It may not have increased or decreased. But it's certainly changed. I don't know what's factual or not. But I know this. The smallish town I live in. For many years. Never used to have house breaking or car stealing. Now? it's everywhere. It comes in waves. And the police know who is doing it. The last few waves? The kids stealing cars were 13 to 16 mostly. And the same age breaking and entering. Is this a youth crime "crisis"??? Who knows. But it was unheard of 5 to 15 years ago. So it's happening whether people admit it or not.
4. ~~LNP marketing department~~ Media
5. Can you be specific where is youth crime down?
6. Yes I agree, it’s the media. But don’t be fooled. The CM and the comm channels are not the powerhouse they once were. Their influence has drastically waned, especially amongst the under 60s. Don’t get me wrong, the influence is still there but they are not in the position they once were.
7. 1984.
8. At a guess, it comes down to two main things. Firstly, rates are down overall. But rates are up in regional centres. Secondly, social media. The rates the crimes are happening isn’t vastly different, but the rate at which we hear about them is. Every FB trash heap community group is filled with “suspicious youths spotted” posts, and every second house had a security camera now to capture video that makes for a more interesting and memorable post. TLDR. The distribution of crime has changed making it more noticeable for some. We hear about it more even if the rate is relatively stable.
9. It's not. If you talk to the Boomers for LNP brigade, they'll tell you youth crime is out of control because the Miles government introduced the 'detention as a last resort for youth' bill earlier this year. Since then the Murdoch media have shouted and stamped their feet every time there is a youth crime committed making us feel like it's out of control because of that one decision
10. maybe it's because there were a handful of youth crime stories that were especially horrific that got a lot of media coverage.
11. I just want the party in that won’t restrict medicinal cannabis. For medicinal cannabis patients, our doctors tell us use vaporiser to inhale our medication but because of Labor’s ridiculous vape laws, getting your hands on a vaporiser is very difficult and prohibitively expensive.
12. Because even though *statistically, across the state, on average* it might be decreasing, there are still everyday people having youths walk into their homes and start taking things while the family is home. Some areas are worse than others, and the *average* which includes Brisbane doesn't help someone living in an area that is worse than average. There are some alarmists, and some deniers. The real truth is an uncomfortable middle groundwhere we admit that some areas of Queensland have a level of youth crime that is unacceptable. TLDR: If someone broke into your home today, you wouldn't care about averages and statistics. You would care that your family isn't safe.
13. Because if you live in Townsville, it is a massive outlier when compared to the state average.
14. So using Cairns as an example if we assess the data, the crime summary shows overall crime in 2001 as 15,824 offences. 2022 shows 22,440 and 2024 currently shows 17,177 which is the lowest figure since 2020 (covid lockdown). These statistics are offences only and don’t factor in population increases, which obviously the entire population of Queensland has increased dramatically since covid (Qld population per census 2001 3,585,639 and per census 2021 was 5,156,138 and 2024 5,560,452 per govt population estimate) I believe 2022 and 2023 show the cost of living crisis really starting to hit. In summary crime reported is down since 2020 for Cairns, the difference between now and 2001 is approximately 1200 more offences not factoring in population growth for that specific region.
15. FNQ crime has sky rocketed. But SEQ has decreased.
16. Because of our mainstream media. It’s really that simple
17. Because boomers hate their own kids and everyone else’s kids too!
18. Because the media only reports when something happens and when it does, they go hard on it. Never heard a news service say today was pretty quiet, no crime to report today Oh btw everything is a crisis
19. Social media sharing and security cameras are now affordable and send you notifications of movement. People used to be none the wiser that someone tried to get into their house/car unsuccessfully.
20. Ok so the media are full of shit... Why isn't Miles calling it out? He should be absolutely going hard on those numbers showing crime had reduced under Labor.
21. Because media is cherry picking data to use it to tell people that it is for their own political agenda. The good news, the 'crisis' will be over tomorrow as the media moves on to what ever is next on their list.
22. Better question, why do the same people who look at the statistics in relation to youth crime and reach the conclusion it is not problematic also think violence against women is at epidemic levels?
23. I would believe youth crime is an issue. If I can’t use my phone when I walk outside from the fear of getting stab or snatch in my hands, like in EU or SEA.
24. Have you ever seen the movie ‘Wag the dog’? Its kinda like that
25. Facebook local groups do a lot of damage here too.
26. Talking to QPS on multiple occasions (due to being a victim of crime on multiple occasions), there is a lot of reoffending where the perpetrator doesn't end up in detention. There is no consequence, hence reoffending. For the record, every offender where I was the victim was caught, already known to QPS, and had already known to have offended at least 20 times. Offences included break and enter, theft, vehicle theft, and vandalism/property damage. I didn't know the offenders. The oldest one was 17. 40% of offences were committed by Indigenous kids. The rest were committed by middle class white kids with a sense of impugnity. And my story isn't unique, so the Reddit warriors lecturing us from their soapboxes with their stats and gaslighting re: how we are racist boomer types without a clue and overall crime isn't rising need to realise we DGAF and would like some law and order please. This isn't a right vs left thing. The current Government isn't fixing it, and I doubt the pissweak opposition will either.
27. I believe there has been an overall for most areas, but there has been an increase in repeat offending & severity of crimes. Someone posted the charts a few days back & I believe it showed NQLD as a region was up quite a bit, but overall down. In the past probably less car jackings, stabbings, violent home invasions etc.
28. Vested interests gonna bullshit, weather at 6
29. The same reason they thought it in the 90s, 70s, and 00s.. media. Rich people push an agenda to scare voters into voting agains their own interest so they can shave a tiny fraction of a percentage of their income the size of nations while people starve to death in the streets
30. Because the media says so.
31. It’s hard to say what influences it. I’ve looked at the crime stats in my area. It doesn’t give the age of perpetrators, but break ins and car thefts are definitely up. And it could be the nature of the crimes too, they might be more obvious or brazen. I know a car was stolen from an elderly lady in my area after the school run, but quite a few of my friends in the area actually drove past two of the perpetrators and noticed them hanging out at the bus stop waiting for the third person - unusual as it’s close to the end of the line and that time of day most people are waiting on the opposite side of the road to commute to town. So it was quite blatant and noticed by hundreds of people. The other issue is that it’s still hard to report crimes, you’re still pushed to the online reporting, that has no definite time frame for a response. And I’m not sure what the response time is currently as they’re not published, but for the tiny sample of incidents I’m aware of, response times aren’t great, which makes victims feel like they’re left isolated when something does occur. It can also be how stats are captured - if you’re not taking or responding to reports they’ll drop. If people have given up reporting, they’ll drop. Time frames will also affect the picture - one stat comparing 20 years may not capture other trends during that time. I’m sTheres other factors that may not be constant that could affect the stats. As UK Prime minister Benjamin Disraeli said, “There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.”
32. Because fear is what they be selling and old folk love to be scared so they got something to bitch about at the local RSL. Also having a society where every person is armed with a personal recording camera allows every single infraction to be recorded and forwarded to ACA for an in depth analysis.
33. Because you’re being told to think that
34. So recently I've started watching snake catching videos, because I watch a lot I've started seeing them more and more. They're often brown snakes which are relatively common where I live. I've been talking to my partner lately about how brown snakes must have been breeding more this year because there's so many. They're a dangerous species so I need to take this concern seriously, I've got security cameras at my place and one actually picked up on one going into my shed the other day. It makes me way more nervous doing the laundry (which is unfortunately in said shed). My partner (who is not currently hooked on snake catching videos) says "it's fine, just wear shoes." I wish this wasnt a true story, but I feel like it lines up a lot. I do see a TONNE of comments and posts and videos about brown snakes, but 20 years ago I didn't have enough friends I regularly heard from to reach even a 10th of my "followed" list, let alone hear their experiences w local threats, and I wasn't living in an algorithm designed to force feed me content.
35. I think it'll depend on what statistics you're looking at. Our population in QLD has soared since COVID with people moving from other stats to get out of stricter lock down measures and staying as well as people returning from overseas after COVID lockdowns and borders opened. A majority of the new immigrants have settled in QLD. So yes, there is likely more instances of crime but when assessed against the "per capita" criteria, it's probably way down. As it is, Australian has the highest youth incarceration/detainment rate of all the developed nations and have since WWII. Clearly, our current system isn't working but I don't think anyone really has the answer.
36. Because the LNP's media buddies have been pushing the narrative nonstop for the last year?
37. Victims of crime numbers up as isnt that what opposition is claiming? All these victim stats include DV and even that kid getting the hot coffee poured on
38. It's easier to tell a lie than to refute it.
39. The media & politicians using it as a diversion tactic.
40. It has gotten more viability as the non-white organised gangs from poor suburbs are going through the well off suburbs and stealing everything not nailed down.
41. Definitely in the increase. And it was all orchestrated.
42. Rupert Murdoch. That's why.
43. So where do the youth offenders who are out on bail with 50+ charges (pending) who break into a house and stab the occupant fit into the statistics? If its purely based on offender numbers, numbers may be down. If its based on other metrics, such as offences per 100,000 people, youth crime is up. Reality is, ask townsville about how crime is down because thats what the internet said
44. 'Youth crime' is also incredibly broad. Is it just 10yo's riding their scooters with no helmet, or 10yo's highjacking cars at the traffic lights at knife point? The big issue is what topic is the most marketable. In essence, which bee is going to get into your (the viewer) bonnet.
45. All you gotta do is look back to the 90s and see the car theft rates back then compared to now, ita nothing compared tp then
46. Have you seen the number of kids with mullets and rats tails? Youth crime is definitely rising
47. Media. Bad news sells.
48. A slowing in exponential growth is still rapid growth as an example, 50% of the 900% of the year prior is still so so sooo many more cases than the stats from 3 years ago where cases were up 50% but that’s 50% more cases of the 10% (total 110%) from the year before that. Politicians’ use of statistics is pretty much the same as a magician’s use of misdirection.
49. Media beat-up that is bolstered with anecdotal “evidence” of the nature of someone knowing someone whose cousin had their car keys stolen. If people want to believe something it doesn’t take much to convince them. When I was living in Toowoomba, if you listened to what people had to say,the place was over-run with teens committing crimes because of the “ice epidemic”. My anecdotal evidence is that as a parent of teens, we had half of the local high school sleep at our house at one time or another and never locked our house. The most criminal activity was some smoking of weed and the time they pranked people they knew by collecting their garden ornaments and writing joke ransom notes before they returned them (most of the prankees found it funny). I saw it as a learning opportunity (because the hostages came to my house), so I spoke to them and convinced them to return them with an apology. Maybe this terrible crime is part of the crime wave people are talking about but it paled into insignificance compared to that lost tradition of “muck-up day” that meant the end of the school year in the 80’s….no fountain or street sign was safe. I question how anyone who has ever parented a teen would echo “adult crime, adult time”….kids make mistakes and if that mistake puts them with adults who are career criminals, what are they going to learn? Not a trade or anything useful, just criminal connections for when they get out. If a 13 year old kid is stealing cars , the first thought should be Why? and fixing the cause…not punishment and retribution. If society isn’t willing to rehabilate a child and instead wants to warehouse them in the prison system, we have really lost sight of what is important. My teen that was involved in the kidnapping and high school drug experimentation is now in his 20’s, earning 6 figures and owns his own home (along with the bank of course). If law enforcement had been involved who knows what the outcome could have been.
50. Fear sells. Fear and anger are much strong emotional reactions than joy ever can create
51. Confirmation bias - they see people complaining about it on FB groups and it’s on the news (extremely biased, often by Murdoch etc).
52. Lies, Murdoch media, poor internet literacy
53. Because of the way the media is reporting it and the media that reports it have a vested interest in generating fear and manipulating public opinion
54. News. Its the news.
55. Because idiots believe Murdoch majority media outright lies😡
56. Murdoch
57. Media sensationalism and the rise of local community groups on social media are the reason to blame. Queensland's broadcasting and publishing media is dominated by a duopoly of News Corps and Nine Entertainment. They account to well over 80% of all news and print media in the state and are both notorious for their right leaning bias. They get off on the success of sensationalising youth crime for ideological reasons as a result. With modern social media and the internet too, there's no shortage or lack of opportunity to find a story somewhere of crime to bash on somebody about and because of the increased engagement of these articles over others they get published more often. Then with the rise of local Facebook community groups in Queensland, it has resulted in a negative feedback loop of very tightly nit friend groups of thousands of people talking to each other constantly in real time on posts about the latest happenings. Negative posts such as thefts or break in attempts generate the most sympathy and engagement in these groups and thus social media algorithms will push these posts to the top of one's news feed more often than other posts. Thus you get flooded with more negativity and this causes a perception that now this is ALL you hear about so clearly this must be happening everywhere... Right? Never mind the hundreds of other happenings you never once read and whereas previously you talked to maybe a dozen or so people on the regular about the latest updates, now you're talking to thousands all the time and someone SOMEWHERE will have had a bad day when your sample size is so much larger. And it gets bumped to the top of the feed every fucking time. If you don't know statistics and how to find the answers in depth like the majority of people, your perception is going to be, "well I'm hearing about it a lot more now, so clearly it must be happening more often." This is completely untrue, but critical thinking skills and basic application of being able to rationally breakdown data is not a prerequisite to being a voter either so it encourages politicians to knowingly revel in the public's misconception on a matter to gain power rather than tell what you as an educated intellectual know is the real truth.
58. Because liars exist. And when they're lying about a problem, they're looking to sell you a solution.
59. It’s the media… plus more people more crime. Not saying that it’s immigration but when this level of individuals come into any country it will make it rise with it. Years ago I worked with two Brazilians that had some very interesting tattoos, turned out they were Latin kings here. “learning English “ great boarder checking…
60. Propaganda dude.
61. The lying Murdoch media propaganda arm of the liberal party, cookers on social media. Anybody who thinks the Newman clone, Is going to do any better then want we have has rocks in their collective heads. Just like Dutton, Cristifulli is dangerous! All that interests both ofthem, is power! Beware
62. If a conservative political party has nothing to offer, it needs to turn people against an “enemy” so they vote against their own interests. The scapegoats shouldn’t have electoral power: this election it’s the youth who are the target.
63. Newsdotcum saturation news.
64. So maybe we need media misinformation laws. Especially, for large media companies with hefty fines.
65. Because the government and media are reporting it 24/7
66. FB echo chambers where the individual incidents are amplified to the extent that many think it's happening to EVERYONE EVERYDAY! Then the media continue to amplify it for viewers or subscriptions or just clicks, and suddenly the data doesn't matter anymore.
67. Manufacturing discontent, that's why
68. People don’t care about facts
69. The media control the narrative, the media want the LNP in thanks to Murdoch. If the crime rate stays the same or increases under the LNP it won’t be reported on. They did the same thing in Victoria with African gangs.
70. The media is not our friend. It's not facts, it's whatever the people at the top want it to be. And they have a chokehold on the older generations. But you see this same control moving into social media.
71. fearmongering from the news and radio thats getting funded by the pols that want you to be scared of it cause it fits there agenda
72. Youth crime hospital crises road accident rates always goes up before an election. Magically if the current government looks shakey ok. So point number 1 if you are in your 30s and have been taking notice of how it works. Point number 2 if you are in your 40s and have not notice the papers and televison atitude sets the mood for election day. It is that simple if you cant figure out by now the 3 major media sources play this game every election radio televsion and news papers who they pick and promote I can not help you if you are aware your best bet is not to argue against a rusted on voter just go about your day Then theres the in fighting in the party it self to add to it
73. Sky News, channel 7 news, channel 9 news, channel 10 news, Murdoch media. That’s the cause.
74. Take into account population growth too, it's probably higher
75. Percentages don’t tell the story properly when there are so many variables. The type of crime, severity, location, who was targeted (residential vs retail/business) drugs vs physical harm vs damage vs theft, etc. Are those figures lumping all of that together? For example, the whole percentage may be going down, but *residential* theft might be higher than it used to be. And if that’s the case, people are rightfully fearing for their safety. I know many people who had a break in for the first time ever in the past 2-3 years, myself included.
76. I live just outside Toowoomba and occasionally I look at our local Facebook group. It's full of LNP voting freaks posting alerts about teenagers walking around the neighbourhood. Not doing anything - just walking around. Like teenagers do. "Heads up! 3 kids in hoodies walking down Paranoid St. Anyone keeping an eye on them?" We've lived here for 8 years and never had any trouble whatsoever. But if you look at the FB page for this area, you'd think we live in a war zone. Its fucking ridiculous.
77. Channel 7, there's ya problem. Owned by that guy who funded the legal cases of both Bruce Luhrmann, rapist, and Ben Roberts-Smith, alleged war-criminal.
78. I haven't looked at the stats, but is there anything about the number of crimes and the severity? It's all well and good to say "per capita crime is down" when we've had a massive influx of immigration from other states and other countries, and if we're including petty theft and kids just generally being little arse holes, to straight up murdering grandmas in the street. Not saying I believe the news, but I don't believe it's as simple as "Number go up, number go down"
79. I'm curious what the crime was compared to 10 years ago
80. You won’t get the truth with data from the police. They are money hungry and not qualified for many areas they tackle!
81. The rectangular plastic box is essentially a machine that buys votes at a given rate for whoever has the money to pay.
82. As long as Murdock owns most of the East Coast newspapers and some of the TV news channels,you are always going to have our version of Fox News US
83. The only people who watch legacy media are the oldies. The oldies love conservative messages. The oldies respond and are riveted to stories of chaos outside the walls of their retirement living areas." Have a look at the kinds of ads that are on free to air TV and in the papers - and you'll see its old legacy trusted brands and messages. Make no mistake, the media know the demographic they have left and milk it to within an inch of its life.
