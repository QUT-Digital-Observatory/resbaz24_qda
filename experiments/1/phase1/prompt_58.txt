Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. I strongly doubt the greens will lose Maiwar, and I have no idea why the ABC was projecting it - The greens are in second place and Labor preferences will get them the win. South Brisbane is probably a loss - The greens are in 1st place on first preferences this time and last time, and the liberals are in third - last time the liberal how to vote card was telling people to put the greens ahead of labor, because they wanted to unseat jackie trad; this time they've got the greens last, and that's what's making the difference. There is still a slim chance though that the liberals might end up with enough votes to slide into second place, in which case the greens will win based off labor preferences
2. The Greens need to move away from virtue signalling about Palestine and focus on actual issues that impact Australians. Imagine looking at all the botted comments on Reddit and thinking this is the primary issue Australians care about
3. Idk why I already forgot today was the election and I thought this post was going to be a thread with tips on finding cheap veggies. 😭
4. I'm in Mairwar, and there were lots of ads about the Greens being dangerous, crime rates will go up, they support terrorists, etc. Clearly targeting boomer fears, so I wonder if that messaging has shifted the preferencing of Labour voters.
5. Personal thoughts. The polls showed a strong swing to LNP, people who are usually Green voters voted for Labor out of fear of LNP, and a lot of people also fell for the "a vote for the Greens is a wasted vote/vote for LNP" rhetoric because that's what Labor constantly says. And it works apparently because I literally saw a bunch of comments on here saying "I usually vote Greens but I'm so scared LNP will get in I'm gonna vote Labor" and I know Labor people who say this sort of shit constantly too. So misrepresenting the prefential voting system is effective in convincing all the noobs who don't know better to vote for them. Then Labor also came out with a bunch of watered down copy cat Greens policies so people thought "why vote Greens when Labor is basically doing the same thing". Miles also outright said he'd prefer a LNP government than govern with a Greens minority and I think that further fucks things up. Coz people think "oh no, can't have that better vote Labor instead of Greens so they'll definitely get in". Fat lot of good that did. And also, where last election the 2 majors would put the Greens above each other in some seats for preference rank, now they are preferencing each other, so there is no room for minor parties. Anyways that's my thoughts. Despite all my criticisms of Labor I really liked Miles and thought he was doing really well and only just getting started too. So I'm really depressed that Queenslanders love the boot so much The sheer size of Qld works against us politically I think, also let's not forget the Greens are getting squeezed on all sides politically. If theres one thing both Labor and Liberals agree on its that they hate the Greens. So yeah.
6. In Maiwar at least you can see preferences shift to both the LNP and labor. Clearly, Miles did a good job of convincing the electorate that labor in general was worth giving another shot (relative to where he started, at least). The LNP swing takes a bit more unpacking. I think the idea that Berkman himself had the wrong policies is kind of dubious, I doubt anyone even really knew anything about his policies specifically. He's significantly less visible than other QLD Greens. I think there's a problem for the Greens in general that the majority of the things people like about them, they cannot achieve without overwhelming political power - something at odds with their fairly consistent overall vote share. Whether or not you want to blame them for this limitation, it makes it hard for them to sandbag seats and hold onto them. I also think there was a very strange phenomenon in Maiwar about a seemingly large, well-funded and fairly aggressive throng of I'm guessing israel-linked activists who seemed determined to punish the Greens for their stance on Palestine. I had seen the political advertising, but I was really surprised to see how many of them showed up to voting stations for this election, especially considering how tenuous the link to Israel/Palestine politics is for the seat. But I could definitely see that shifting some people.
7. Because being a militant ideologue is not attractive to most people, nor is it practical in a parliamentary democracy. Sri just comes off like a university student politician to me.
8. I feel that the Greens have forgotten their roots, they are currently a bunch of NIMBYs who don’t care about the environment, they don’t talk about protecting the environment, they are unrealistic about urban development, they want the inner city to stay like it is, filled with big houses with yards and to have the planes fly over the poor people’s suburbs because people who can afford to travel shouldn’t have to deal with the noise.
9. All ideas and no substance
10. I'm not a greens supporter but it would have been good to see the minor parties grab some seats and steal the majority away from our colesworth two party majority. If we want any meaningful change in this country, we need to start voting in our minor parties. Voting in one nation, katter party, the greens, progressive party, etc.. will lead to a true democracy. With no majority government, these parties will need to debate and compromise to lead us to a better future. Much like the inception of democracy in ancient Greece. Debating on issues from many different points of view to come to a meaningful conclusion.
11. Batshit insane policy like capping food prices, capping rents and starting up a bank. Nobody is high enough to believe that's realistic.
12. When your state and national agenda is Palestine and blocking meaningful housing reform this was always bound to happen.
13. Green to me is Jonno Siri. No thanks
14. Hardly surprising, the greens have lost their way. They focus almost entirely on niche social issues that affect a tiny section of the population and their environmental policies have been made an afterthought. Perhaps if they stopped pandering for sound bites with hard-line policies they know they'll never have to actually make work, they'd have people voting for them. I stopped voting for them about 8 years ago.
15. The Greens get about 10% of the vote and 0-1 seats. Katter’s party gets 3% and 3 seats. So there’s that.
16. Labor pulled away Green votes because they thought that would be a good strategy instead of retaining their own / fighting marginal LNP seats. Greens voters liked that Labor used Greens policies and feared LNP abortion laws etc so swung over to Labor in these seats. I don't really see it as Greens failing. We just had a rare good candidate in Labor for once.
17. What's to blame for this? Lydia Thorpe Seen to be too close to, sympathetic with the radical portions of the Palestine protests, including terrorists flag waving and anti-Semitism. Not denouncing violence, property damage etc that has been occuring during the protests. Green senators or MPs refusing to denounce particular terrorist groups or attacks Obstructionist at a federal level regarding housing supply reform ( especially Max Chandler-mather) Bizarre policies like state owned / nationalised banks Standing with / Protesting with a disgraced union (CFMEU) and protesting against intervention into the corruption and criminal conduct occuring within
18. Perhaps they should stop coming out in support of hamas and hezbollah terrorists.
19. People are over their radical agenda, and stopping traffic on busy roads was the last straw
20. Max is a fucking wanker, and absolutely fouled the greens. I’m not a greens supporter, I was pretty neutral on them - seeing them as sort of the hopeful dreamers that just spit out fanciful ideas and take credit for their realistic implementation, but now… How could you dismiss the HAFF as “just a series of complicated bank accounts”. Absolute moron. “It CosTs mOre THaN ThirtY ThOUSand to buiLd a hOUSe LABOR”. Absolute dregs of the intellectual barrel attempting to masquerade as useful and informed.
21. Focus on retaining the seats they have at federal level, and don't fight Labor on issues that offer an immediate solution. That is the lesson Labor just learnt in NQ. If they want to play politics, the can nominate one of their party members for Speaker of The House and gain some sympathy there.
22. I think the minor parties lost out due to fear of having lnp in. Can't risk losing a labor seat for an lnp one
23. Looks like Berkman will keep his seat
24. *disclaimer - haven't read this whole thread* The greens are no longer the party that Bob Brown championed. I grew up in West End, and Northern NSW. Am ethically a staunch lefty. I come from unionists, farmers, pro human rights, queer allie, pro harm reduction... you name it. The greens have lost their way. They have decided that 'not good enough' means 'block it and fight it' instead of working towards change from the inside out. Radical policy and soapboxing 'grassroots' movement in a two party system is not productive, and while i admire the fight, they have ultimately isolated themselves by pushing for radical agendas in a very ingrained, colonial Westminster system. Policy change, acceptance, and integration in the lens of community development can take up to 10 years to be implemented, accepted, and seen as a result. You can't force radical change on people in such a privileged country and expect everyone to just jump ship. The fact that this is an issue is the tip of an iceberg. With respect to the ideal - the approach is not inclusive, its not an open conversation, its one or the other and we as a country have it far to good for that to create the right outcome. You can't create change and change engrained views by being noisy in this day and age. You have to be smart. You have to educate gently, and you have to be holistic. I believe they can do better, and i hope they do, but they need to rethink their strategy and consider how to engage a broader audience. Just an opinion. Very dissapointed by the election outcome, but i didn't see it going any other way. These parties need to rethink the approach.
25. Not surprising. The Greens aren't sustainable. That's the irony. Their socialist policies are easily copied by Labor. Their economic policies are a threat to the average punter's super balance and desire to have a bit left over for themselves. Telling nurses and cops, teachers and public servants that there's a freeze on their rent is just out of touch. No matter the social reason, it's politically immature. Their environmental policy is their only differentiation. And that isn't enough to keep voters. The party is dead in the water. And that is a good thing. Why? Because the party hasn't got the experience to run a country, a state or a council. They can throw stones, get loud and oppose. But, when it comes to governing, you need substance, real foundations, wide appeal and policies that have economic advantages for the whole. For the Greens to survive their leaders and members need to leave the city, go and work on farms and truly understand the challenges of the regions. Can't tell people how to live their lives if you haven't walked in their boots and truly listened to their realities. It'll always be the Greens' downfall. Bob Brown learned that the hard way, on a bus. This may be unpopular on this forum of Greens and Labor lovers. The results of tonight are also unpopular.
26. I was at a few booths today in seats that the Greens were targeting. I can't say for certain because I don't know what their volunteers were told to say re: messaging when handing out HTVs. But the message seemed to change from booth to booth - and this wasn't between electorates, but within. One particular booth was consistently "Vote for a progressive change", and another I didn't hear those words uttered whatsoever. The amount of signage they had up as well with a lot of different messaging was really overwhelming. Whilst I believe they needed to focus on making Maiwar and South Brisbane a fortress for future campaigns, the fact they didn't meant they really needed a different type of approach to what they delivered on the ground. Where the Greens have come to prominence has been on the back of backlash towards the major parties. So they needed a simple central theme that really tapped into that. I'm just not sure they actually had that.
27. Be nice if the greens were there for environmental reason, but they're not
28. Imma be real, why the fuck are you asking that in this sub? You’re just going to get people (which you already are) saying greens are bad for being leftists. Especially when you’ll have ALP voters kinda blaming greens voters, and we know for a fact now that a majority of Queenslanders want something antithetical to the greens.
29. Perhaps people cottoned on to the fact that the Greens aren't about the environment at all - the name is a complete misnomer. They should really have been the Reds.
30. People are just sick of the greens empty promises
31. Maybe they could get out and do some real direct climate action..
32. Labor moved leftwards and the Greens couldn't differentiate. Also Amy McMahon just had terrible political instincts.
33. I’d say the batshit crazy policies were a significant factor.
34. Max has not represented the area well being anti progress on every thing and anything. He will be gone next federal election as he is all bark and no action. He has not represented the long time residents of the area that want to see change to a more modern livable inner city Gabba such as SE Square. Time for him to look for a job next election.
35. >What is to blame for this? Bad policies???
36. Many people want to back a party that presents a clear, unified message. When climate protests become platforms for various other political issues, it can dilute the urgency of the climate crisis and make it harder for normal ppl to engage fully. The need for cohesion in messaging is crucial for broader appeal, especially when the stakes are as high as they are with climate change. I 100% think we should be fighting for climate action but would never vote Greens as they are too quick to jump on the “next big outrage” rather than focus on long term changes.
37. I don't really have any comments as to the how or why. Just a shame overall to have less voices in parliament other than red and blue. No new independents and just another KAP MP maybe, and they have delved into National Party territory with social issues rather than staying strictly as an agrarian party
38. Lack of strong leadership and no strategy even greens supporters I knew said the party is unrecognisable and didn’t vote for them. Plus a very poor campaign
39. We all know their solution will be to lean further into Gaza and identity politics etc. which the median voter doesn't give a shit about, but will solidify their lefty inner-city base.
40. People associate Greens with environmentalism, they associate environmentalism with a higher cost of living. Greens aren't likely to get a look in right now
41. It's such a mystery?
42. I have been in the middle on greens and pretty much everything about there platform has turned me away the last couple of years. A seeming lack of willingness to work for achievable goals, Idpol plastered all over their website, very strange or non existent plans to implement things that set huge economic precedents about how we manage our economy. Not to mention the general snakeyness i get from Max Chandler Mather, but thats a personal gripe. I also feel the Greens lost out in this election because the ALP had some very progressive policies already. Why protest vote for the greens if the ALP is already promising what you want.
43. People just going to gloss over the fact that the ALP and QLP have campaigned successfully to demonise the Greens for the last 3 years? If there is one thing the major parties are terrified of, it's not having a majority vote i.e they are scared of actual democracy.
44. Good the greens should never have more than 0 seats
45. It's because the party has been infiltrated by watermelons. Red(dit) on the inside, green on the out. Stick to environment. Queenslanders do not appreciate a socialist agenda.
46. The Greens vote hasn't changed that much (may even end up being 0.something % up, I'm too lazy to check) it's more that the specifics of preference flows and where different parties finished on the ballot are less likely to favor them. If this did end up being a wipeout for labor they propably would have won a few Brisbane seats. I think people saw the trio of federal seat wins as a permanent surge for the Greens when in reality it was a side effect of Labor's Queensland vote tanking at that election. Not sure how the Greens can improve their seat tally, maybe they can't, very possible that they've saturated the portion of Australians who will vote for a party like that and a large seat haul will continue to be very situational- I think the 20% or so in major cities who vote for them will continue to do so, but I do know that if the go in the direction of the German Greens and chase "moderate voters" by becoming imperialists on bicycles, many of those voters (myself included) will abandon them.
47. Funny I had a green candidate, one nation, and family first, I haven’t seen three of them campaign. Normally they be in the city or Northside, when they came out.
48. I know the private jet debacle turned away a few of my friends. Also the greens policies have radically changed over the last 10 years. Seems like they're trying to hop on the hot trend instead of sticking to their roots.
49. The Greens do well when they go to the grassroots, focussing on local issues and the environment. The state greens fell flat because they just didn't have a base. Left Wing voters, who might've shifted at this election, were wooed over by QLDLabor's more progressive policy initiatives. They couldn't win over the suburban moderate voters because their federal leadership has become far too occupied on divisive social issues. Maybe if their candidates focussed a bit more on the issues of their electorates they would've done better.
50. I'd say it has to do with Labor refusing to work with the Greens. Just like in Tasmania where Labor could have won minority government but refused a coalition with the Greens. And people voting left were worried about the LNP winning so they just voted Labor to get across the line.
51. Greens are too focused on being Iran's useful idiots these days.
52. I voted green in the last federal election. I didn't this time because of their anti semitism
53. The same reason why reddit turns into echo chamber and out of touch with people of conservative ( normal and rational for me) thinking. I saw people here purely downvote others without actually understanding others, which are very common in leftist circles.
54. The abortion thingy was obvious bait tbh. When you structure your entire campaign around abortion you’re only appealing to women’s issues, which isn’t a bad thing, but it is a bad thing when it’s only one political issue that only really affects a subset of women (it’s also a weaker campaign overall since we’re in Australia and don’t realistically have to worry about anti-abortion laws). Green’s did’t feel like they were sticking to their own values this election. A diversified campaign (actually diversified not corporately diversified) would’ve gone further in the voting campaign. (I still voted for them though 😒 but it was out of principle)
55. The state wide Greens vote is basically the same as it was last election (just under 10%) yet they may have 0 seats in parliament. People haven't turned away from the Greens overall, you're just seeing the reality of a single-member and ultimately non-proportional representation system.
56. My impression with them is they're trying to legislate problems away which is a dangerous move which causes more unintended consequences in years down the line, that's why I put them last. Their heart is in the right place but their implementation is dangerous
57. Because the greens are and have always been delusion people living in a fantasy land. I probably sound like a 60 year old (19 in fact). I have seen them spread totally incorrect information time and time again about industries I have worked in.
58. Hopefully fucking reality
59. The second worst greens MP is qld greens, MCM has fucked their brand here in qld.
60. The political wilderness. The greens should LOVE it there!
61. A great result. Exactly what they deserved with their dumb as dogshit policies.
62. FAFO
63. Greens are a wasted vote
64. The Greens have had their time and are no longer relevant.
65. Its beautiful. Good bye woke culture. The circle jerk here in their echo chamber are now realizing people have had enough of your crap. Right wing non socialist is back in full swing. Heres to a nuclear hetrosexual family. 🥂 Cheers
66. [removed]
67. "who to blame" What's her name put me off them this time. Lydia Thorpe Seen to be too close to, sympathetic with the radical portions of ..... literally was in bed with xxxxxxxxxxxxxx and still gets paid a quarter of a million dollars by taxpayers
68. There was 0 campaign in bancroft for the greens. I was so disappointed
69. Far left siding with the far right on issues and they can't work out where they went wrong..... you couldn't make this shit up.
70. Because the greens are nutters.
71. Serves those cunts right. I hope they enjoy the loot&polute LNP they helped install.
72. They tried green washing socialist policies, used populist sloganeering and appeared to move away from climate and environmental issues as their main focus, looked like a bunch of phonies and lost a lot of their traditional support. They could either change their name to the Socialist party, or go back to promoting their green policies as their main priority.
73. Too many of their members had stupid fucking time waste campaigns like “making the brisbane river swimmable” 🤮
74. I’ve thought this too- I think there is more overlap in greens/labour supporters than greens/lnp. With all the news lnp would win, I know a couple of people traditionally greens voters who switched to labour in the hope it would keep them in.
75. Yeah, a lot of this result can be chalked up to Miles pitching himself strongly as a progressive and campaigning strongly to the millennial/gen z demographics that normally support the Greens. Arguably the most left-wing Labor campaign in decades. I don’t expect to see Albanese doing the same at a federal level.
76. If the people who voted green before now vote Labor, you'd assume they put greens 2nd now which would make no diff to the current result which has the 2 horse race between lnp and greens. The reality is the lnp won maiwar off the strength of their own first preferences and nothing else or the greens just outright lost the faith of the electorate (if the lnp do ultimately win)
77. We don't have time to fuck around. And there was lots of momentum from the last election. For the greens it is not about getting as many seats as they can, it is about changing for the good.
78. > Also Miles was more progressive than standard labor, so why would a progressive vote green when they could vote for Labor (free lunch, 50c fares, etc) Because we don't have the system of the yanks, so people who would vote for progressives, would still vote for the actual progressive party? What a strange line of reasoning.
79. This is largely it. Plus they won the leafy seats in large part due to being the de-facto local teals. A big chunk of their vote swung straight from LNP to Green, which makes the local politics quite different. It's not surprising that when there's a serious chance of getting the LNP up, a large number of those voters have swung right back, especially when the federal party has been running good-is-the-enemy-of-the-perfect tactics nonstop.
80. its over buddy, greens 0 seats
81. I think they also missed the point. They were making promises that they can only implement IF they form government. So basically making false promises. They should have focused more locally on stuff they could influence/implement if they were the elected local member.
82. A good example is the problem I have with the greens on their response to housing. They told everyone there is a rent urgent crisis, a true break glass in case of an emergency, a fire that is raging needs a solution NOW. I for one believe them that yes this is an emergency, which means that I found the amount of political brokering or stalling utterly cynical. I don't care if some developers are going to make out like bandits or the Green aren't going to get their preferred public housing policy, just do something now to start building. I'd compare it to say, blocking increasing RFS budget because you aren't happy with climate change policy.
