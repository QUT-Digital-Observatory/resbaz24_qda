Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Of course they are only my opinions. Extreme is a strong word, and I should defend it, I agree. When I describe the Greens housing policy as extreme, it is because (a) it expressly aims to introduce rent freezes, which is against the constitution. There have been three referendums in our history to change the constitution to allow that price control power, and they have each been defeated. So a policy that is unconstitutional is already a good argument to describe it as extreme. It is also ridiculous. (the Greens answer to this is get the States to do it; it's a Federal policy, but one that can't be implemented federally. Attempts to enforce this would lead to "interesting" High Court challenges). (b) it aims to end the role of private landlords and to substitute the missing capital investment in housing via massive tax increases on middle class Australians. The vision of renting is life long pseudo renting in state-owned housing. ("30% of all construction will be built by the government", which is the current share of private rentals) \* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxTbgJawcXg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxTbgJawcXg) I find these points combine to be an extreme position in the Australian political context. I am conflating federal and state policies, and giving precedence to the federal position. This is my bad but I am taking a national perspective. When you talk about things like "fully funding schools, actually build more housing.",you are stating objectives. Policy also includes how you get there because politics is about compromises and contested decisions (e.g. tax cuts vs tax increases). And the Greens do have a proposal on how it will be achieved because while you might not care about how it will happen, most voters do, and Greens have to say how they plan to do it. I didn't make up points (a) and (b). That is Green policy. As to your comments on Green votes, I have door knocked, and I campaigned for a Teal at the last election, once even for the Greens. I now live in a ALP/Green electorate. Anecdotally, I stand by my observations, and they match the demographic profile of the Green booths in my electorate. But actually I am repeating expert opinion based on mass observations. And then, there are the election results from Victoria, Tasmania, NSW, ACT and now Queensland. We are just passing the peak of the housing crisis. For a party which has nailed its flag to the mast of HMS Housing Crisis, this is as good as it's going to get. And it didn't really get very good. You can huff and puff about my choice of words, but no one can wash away the election results (would that be Green Washing?). The Greens are still doing worse than in the Bob Brown days (in vote share), when they actually were an environmental party. These days, innocent bystanders probably think Green Left is a Green's publication/website. It is really sweet that you have identified "empathy" as a voting block. Not one that political experts use, though. I am sure that you are a much nicer person than me.
2. PS Most economists agree that the CGT discount for inflation should be removed. There is no such thing as "CGT exemption". The rules for housing as the same as for every other asset class. What you say doesn't make sense. It gives the impression that you don't know what you are talking about. As for negative gearing, there are almost no economists who rate it is a very useful thing. Almost all economists predict that completely removing it will raise rents (and the Greens policy is to completely remove it). Most models say it will reduce house prices by a stunning 1% to 2% (because supply reduces in line with the removed demand). It is not good policy, even if only because it is the wrong thing to focus on. Even the Guardian no longer rates it as an area of policy importance ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqUFERBJwoY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqUFERBJwoY) ) But even more amusingly, only 39% of self-identified Greens voters agree with Greens policy, according to the recent Resolve poll. Considering this is after taking away the many voters which have the left the Greens due to their housing position, that is remarkable. Sure, many voters support restrictions on negative gearing, but the Greens advocate for its complete removal, and assuming that the middle class property investors fail to react to their much higher tax bill, then they use this to fund the rest of their policy. You don't like me to say it, but the Greens have taken an extreme position on this. However, it's true that a lot of voters in that poll wanted some curtailment of negative gearing. But before you celebrate the wisdom of the Australian voter (confirmation bias), note that one policy position was more popular than any other: The LNP's super withdrawal policy. Which I also don't rate as very good policy, not sure what you think about it.
3. You really really hate when people try to politicise the Greens stance on Gaza 😂 The greens are politicising every crazy idea they can think of... that's what they do. But no, it's everyone else who is politicising things, not the actual political party you support.
4. You make them sound like a Marvel movie.
5. This was lost on my mates who were lnp voters - labor’s not anti mining just taking qlders right to a slice of the pie. In all the average voter is ill informed at best. Plain stupid at worst
6. You do realise almost all the profits from mining go overseas?
7. What would you recommend Greens do from your perspective?
8. Centrists are already right. No one pushed them. They just took off their masks. Also, Labor policies overtime are moving more right.
9. Major Greens policies included free/cheap fares, free school lunches, free GP clinics, cheap rents and mortgages, capping grocery prices, no new coal and gas - not exactly unpopular policies? Institutions of power won't allow you to win simply with good or popular policies, because in contrast to more conservative politics, left-wing politics stands against those institutions e.g business. If the major parties and media spent half as much time attacking Greens policies and politicians cf. Katter, independents in their respective seats, you would have a different result. It became even irresponsible - Stephen Miles for example, spent a bulk of his time on election day bussing around to different polling booths in Greens target seats rather than LNP. Labor also adopted half of the Greens platform in the eleventh hour and this also diverted would-be Greens voters to vote ALP, either in fear of LNP or to 'reward' Labor (both of which indicate a lack of understanding of preferential voting / political strategy). None of this is to say there werent internal factors affecting Greens chances, but to say that all they need is policy to me, with all due respect, comes across as a bit naive.
10. KAP have the "racist uncle" section of Facebook locked down. They don't need explicit MSM support because there's an entire online social media ecosystem to cater to their needs
11. Though there are internal factors Greens could have changed to help their chances, their policies are definitely popular e.g. cheap/free fares, cheap/free school lunches, no new coal and gas, taxing corporations etc. So it's not simply about their policies. The mainstream media interprets, reports, and frames information. They also decide what to report on and what to ignore, and shape popular discourses. They don't just transmit information directly to peoples' brains. The ABC, once considered a solidly progressive media outlet, compared Adam Bandt to Trump at one point - not exactly an 'unbiased' account or decision. Media organisations have their structural backers and ideological biases as does anyone else. If you think this is a conspiracy, it means you don't understand bias in reporting. It's simply how institutions of power work. Would highly rec e.g. Chomsky's Manufacturing Consent.
12. I don't seem to understand how people don't understand how by not giving money to Israel we can use it on actually worthwhile things to spend on instead of cutting the budget for other things again and again.
13. 'These left-leaning ideas take up a lot of time on letting leaning media'. Also I'm assuming by mental illness you just mean people with mental health issues? Since when was caring about that a left leaning issue? Australia loves to go on and on about its mental health crisis only to do nothing about it.
14. >Promotion of homosexuality, mental illness, pro immigration, and feminism Acknowledgement and acceptance of these issues, and discussing them rationally, is not "promotion."
15. It’s 39-34-23 for LNP-Greens-Labor currently. Surely it comes down to how many Labor voters would preference LNP above Greens? (Genuine question).
16. 😂
17. The prepoll numbers are included in the ECQ results, so it might come down to the postals
18. Lol sure buddy sure
19. You'll have to book a colonoscopy if you want to see his sources
20. 54:46 to the LNP and no GRN seats. Nature to be commanded must be obeyed.
21. I live under a major flight route already that has 2 late night/early morning widebody departures nearly every day of the week ... Aircraft noise is a part of living in an isolated country in the year 2024. It's just not practical here given that we are an island. There are 4 airports in Australia that have a curfew. In addition, Sydney has built a 2nd airport to operate 24/7. It's a weird hill to die on.
22. Reddit in a nutshell basically 🤷‍♂️
23. Ok so no examples. You’re clearly recycling something you read from murdoch or some other right winger
24. Hahaha mate literally look at the yellow writing on the bottom right
25. Cairns appears to be going labors way, but I think that's more to do with lnp running Cruella de Vil.
26. Hope you feel great about 12 year olda going to jail on adult sentences, setting them up for a life as a hardened criminal. I agree it is an issue. The LNP approach is against all research and evidence of what will really solve the problem. It is a lock them up out of sight and let them rot approach.
27. > You can keep telling people of NQ and FNQ what their lived experience is but they won’t listen, we’re used to SEQ gaslighting and trying to tell us what it’s like up here without ever having been here. [Here's the Police saying Youth Crime is going down.](https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/news/2024/04/15/youth-offending-declines-as-government-agencies-unite-against-youth-crime/) I feel like they'd know what's going on with crime, given they're the fucking police.
28. Downvotes confirm I am right! Just bubble harder, white collar social democrats!
29. Just on the doctors and abortions, I am sure a doctor could still have the option to conscientiously decline to perform an abortion. And private hospitals were exempt from even entertaining it even if they had a willing doctor. I believe a woman/couple should have the choice to abort the child if they want with a robust system that educates and protects the woman if she chooses she wants the child. I also support voluntary assisted dying for the terminally ill. I fear the LNP will also take that away and people in palliative care will suffer painful deaths.
30. This is nonsense.
31. Renewables make up 35% of electricity generation. Electricity is merely 1/3 of total energy demand. There is coal fired electricity, thermal coal and liquid fuels. Liquid fuels make up over half of total energy demand. Renewables cannot do this without a colossal investment in batteries or embracing hydroelectricity again. What if our population goes to 35 / 40 million in 10 - 15 years? The recent CSIRO analyses of generation costs make overly optimistic assumptions about renewables and the worst possible assumptions about nuclear, even assuming SMRs have a 30 year lifespan whereas they are more typically 60 - 80 years. 1000 MW of nuke is the same as 4000 MW (1/4 of nameplate capacity) of solar or wind PLUS storage. The CSIRO are pretending backup costs don’t exist and it is profoundly dishonest. You want an entirely renewable energy economy by the time we hit 40 mn Aussies? You’d need 30 times current capacity with sufficient battery backup and grid improvements. Even 82% of electricity supply by 2030 is just delusional.
32. The responsibility to provide evidence belongs to the one making the claim.
33. Evidence?
34. Its not the only thing no but its a contributing factor, i think the biggest issue is the hamas love followed by out of control bills and council rate hikes, the new carbon taxes every few years like the new ute tax and then to top it off they all refuse to even look at nuclear power because the libs said it first and so now they cant be seen to agree with them its what are you five its clearly needed
35. It had everything to do with it, QLD is a funny thing well put up with peoples bs to vote the way we always have but all these things pile up and a lot of people i talk to have mentioned this specifically as a deciding factor and saying the other states did it too doesnt make it any less bad, i mean daniel andrews is hated more but we dont live there so he never impacted us but ana and by extension miles did
36. But the 60s is not 80 years ago.
37. Then it sounds less like a case of party politics and fear of Liberals taking the seat and more trust in a specific candidate to do what's right. Which honestly should be how people vote anyway.
38. That’s how Amy lost her seat in South Brisbane - people not really understanding the voting system.
39. People really don’t understand our preference system…
40. But you can influence Labor getting 50% ..
41. Maybe you should do some small amount of research into the history of Israel and Palestine. It's not like October 7 occurred in a vacuum. The greens have always condemned the actions of Hamas. Predominantly they've been calling for a ceasefire and I struggle to understand how that is particularly controversial? I'm honestly curious what media you consume to give you this impression? Israel is accused of multiple war crimes, and on trial for genocide and conducting an apartheid regime with the International Criminal Court...
42. The greens do have an optics issue. Partly because of Murdoch and partly because of people like yourself parroting this bullshit. "PERFECT IS THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD" is another one of Labor's rhetoric they throw out in order to not engage with debate. Sure - supporting the CFMEU against anti-union legislation and supporting Palestine might not look fantastic for an uninformed voter. We do it because it's the right thing to do. Hopefully at some point integrity will shine through. It's currently sorely lacking in Labor and has been lacking in the Liberal party for at least a decade. You need to educate yourself on protest movements. Its because of protest movements that you get 2 days off on a weekend and not 1 as well as a host of other worker rights. A protest that inconveniences nobody is a protest that the government is very willing to ignore. I call bullshit on you "wanting to support a party like the greens." If you think that's true you need to do some self reflection. How do the greens tread your incredibly thin line of standing up for what's right whilst not "giving bad optics" or "inconveniencing" any Australian? You think we manage to get significant change by writing stern but polite letters? We get change by winning debates? We're already winning debates on policy because the other parties don't have a leg to stand on.
43. Holding out for better options is required when dealing with plans and policy that have decades long timelines. If you propose a plan that only incrementally improves conditions and takes a decade to implement, you can't go screaming "perfect is the enemy of good enough". This is the issue with the slow burn approach of the ALP and their rhetoric. This is aggravated EVEN MORE by the fact that Australians have short memories and will just as quickly vote in "the other mob" after less than a decade later before any improvement is even noticeable with the "good enough" plan. Then the other mob undo all the incremental progress in one term, and we're back where we started. The ALP try to play the middle, the greens try to force the issue and get much improved policy that rapidly improves conditions and will be harder to undo the impact of when the LNP inevitably get in and the ALP claim foul. If we want to materially change the conditions of the majority of australians and improve our country as a whole, we need policies that take drastic action and gain momentum toward progress, because the idea that we can slowly build toward a better future is ridiculous when the LNP and other conservative parties are more than happy to throw a match and some gasoline on the whole thing as soon as they gain any amount of power.
44. By politicising they mean that the greens do not have their stance on the ongoing genocide in gaza in order to gain muslim voters. They have the stance because genocide is bad, no matter what population it is being committed against. People and communities are capable of supporting causes and protesting injustice without some underlying self interest.
45. And you sound like a landlord. The genocide in gaza is wrong. It wouldn't matter if the victims were the Israeli population or the Palestinian population, the greens would protest in either case. Because systematically wiping out any population of people to steal their land is evil.
46. It's a tricky time for Greens.. "the left" is leaking votes even if the Greens are making small gains of popularity in areas where they are already popular. Greens logically think their best chance to secure more votes and seats are taking those from Labor, however attacking Labor as Lib Lite is leaving the pool of voters between Labor and Liberals starting to lean slightly towards Libs. This is short-term thinking from the Greens and doesn't help build a progressive voter population. If I were to make some recommendations for Greens, it would be that they help get policies they support in the door and keep going versus holding off policies they want because they want more. Take the shared equity policy, it was something Greens had in their policy plans for the last election, and now that Labor has the same style of policy, let's "negotiate" on things like what % gov could own, who is eligible for it, etc. Greens could focus on making that specific policy as good as possible. We all make progress, then we get on to the next thing. Currently, they hold it off, they demand action on policies they fully well know are tricky to implement politically and leave the Libs to make the "left" seem like they haven't got a clue what they are doing. Greens and Labor have to end the hostility to focus on getting their pool of voters to 60%+.
47. Agreed, response is based on the current voting population who are leaning that way, Greens and Labor need to be convincing that edge to come left. (Side note yelling that they should be more left ain’t it). I think Adam’s strategy is losing votes at that edge to grab a few votes between Greens and Labor which plays straight into Liberals hands. 🤷‍♂️
48. With mimdsets like this I don't know how the greens didn't sweep the state
49. >Major Greens policies included free/cheap fares, free school lunches, free GP clinics, cheap rents and mortgages, capping grocery prices, no new coal and gas - not exactly unpopular policies? Evidently those that were taken to election by labour as well were popular. Some of these have no economic basis and should be dealt with outside of end consumer pricing like rent and grocery caps or influencing the RBA. Most voters can see through that. You're forgetting the other stuff that the Greens party in general have done these last couple of years are different from labour and lnp that would be unpopular to voters and even their core voting demographics. Again clearly evident this election. >Labor also adopted half of the Greens platform in the eleventh hour and this also diverted would-be Greens voters to vote ALP The LNP did this too and this sounds like democracy at work. This a mask off moment? If the Greens cared about the voters more than just winning then they would be happy for this as many Greens supporters also claim that its their job to push the government towards the left no? If the entirety of the Greens platform was popular and labour adopted them entirely to win would you still be complaining? Is it because you just don't like the colour or the individual representatives? To say or assume that all they mainly only have popular policies or that most of their platform would be popular, comes across as a bit naive.
50. That is because they are popular enough to be numerous enough have their own circlejerk. If the Greens or any other independent were really popular enough, they'd have their own circlejerk corner of whatever media locked down as well. Actually, there are many facebook communities of whatever political bent. They are just not popular enough to gain ideological dominance.
51. I guess you meant to write if I don't think it is a conspiracy. I am about the last person to be interested in unprovable propositions as a method of explaining things. They are intellectual junk bonds. You missed the logic of my point. The Greens did win seats in the recent past. Does the conspiracy only appear when they are losing seats? I'm familiar with Chomsky... I'm a linguistics major. I also read Manufacturing Consent. It is very dated now. The mainstream media is barely hanging on. Plus Greens voters, the most educated and by far the most likely to have encountered Pilger and Chomsky are the least likely to fall for nasty conspiracy theories. ... In Maiwar they lost 17% of their primary vote. The problem is not that they are not growing. They are losing voters. Did all these voters suddenly fall victim to the MSM? Pull the other one. I think you are in denial about the Greens political strategy. They have bet the house so to speak on policies which don't have appeal and they have overplayed their hand. Bandt needs to put his big boy pants on and do something. Max needs another job. Maybe somewhere there are some rabbits he can look after. I think he'd like that. Lots of running around outside.
52. Can you share, specifically, where the Australian government is "giving money to Israel". I do think this is part of a problem with the Palestinian support movement, the repetition of US talking points, who very much do give financial aid to Israel really doesn’t inspire a huge amount of confidence in the Australian context.
53. Because what we do spend on Israel is a drop in the bucket and the Geopolitical implications of cutting ties with Israel go so far beyond just “doing the right thing”. Regardless, The Greens have become the party that shoots down good ideas because they aren’t perfect ideas and would do well to reassess their game plan to be taken seriously by the average punter
54. It's $700 a week to live in the caravan park in my city in Queensland, that's where you end up if your abusive partner kicks you out because you're too hard to control, or your behaviour becomes too much for the people you live with, or your parents kick you out because your gay, or the community ostracised you for drinking/stealing; now you're out on the street so you can live in a car if you have one , couch surf, or stay at the caravan park which is the last rung on the ladder that you hit on the way down. The media talks a lot of shit but when you need help you're not going to get it from Labor, Greens, or the ABC; they're too busy talking out their ass so everyone votes for the "I got mine and fuck everyone else party" because in reality that's how it is in Queensland today and in comparison to other States and especially NZ it's much cheaper to live up here.
55. Send them back to Victoria. Job done.
56. The Government makes decisions with their benefactor and it the media's job to sell it to us.
57. Yes, you are right. I was wrong. The Greens only need about 65% of ALP preferences, and they will get about 80%. They will keep Maiwar, just. By about 1000 votes perhaps. They have lost about 17% of their voters at the last election, but they will hang on since most of the lost votes went to the ALP, and will come back. Lucky full preferential voting is compulsory, perhaps :) It won't be next time, I guess.
58. Victim card at the ready... how surprising.
59. But why does it have to be that way? There are other ways of getting stuff to and from Australia. Perhaps you have heard of these things called "ships"? Brisbane gets the crappy timeslots because they can't be used for Gold Coast, Sydney or Adelaide. It makes commercial sense, but it pisses me off that the Qld Govt was throwing buckets of cash to the foreign airlines that make all the frigging night time noise. No way there needs to be as much air travel, and given how garbage the experience has become I wonder why people bother. The exposure that the Greens have put on air traffic management shows how much regulatory capture there is with the government basically the bitch of the industry. Wining and dining of politicians with "Chairmans Lounge" access and flight upgrades is corruption.
