Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Their policy on being tough on crime is incredibly general, nor does it describe how they will address the issue. They want to enhance putative measures. Yet, it is clear that enhanced education outcomes is the best protective variable. So it stands to reason that any initiative that keeps kids in school and adequately performing, whilst being sensitive to issues impacting performance, is our best offensive and defensive plan. Thus, their plans go against the accumulated evidence in all western countries, including ours. It is not evidence-based and is entirely concerned with problem-focused immediate response, rather than solution-focused and longitudinally framed; enhancing the potential for cascading negative effects for individuals and society 20 years down the track. For example, they say they want to prevent future crime by identifying at-risk youth for a life of criminal conduct (we literally cannot even do that and even more importantly, being born as non-white will indirectly increase your risk automatically on most measures available for risk assessment), and then make them attend camps/programs to address this. However, all the accumulated evidence suggests that most people naturally commit some crime and it naturally desists by 25yrs. It also suggests that placing kids in contact with police and other systems increases their risk of further contact. They oppose some important incremental population-level initiatives (saliently the free-lunch scheme) that keeps disadvantaged kids performing (thus also less cranky) in school, which inherently reduces both youth-limited and life-long criminal conduct. When I say this, I am referring to the systhesis of robust evidence coming from Terri Moffit's typologies of developmental pathways to antisocial conduct, and population-level initiatives such as social and emotional learning programs (E.g., see meta-analysis by Durlak et al., 2011). On a last point, this is not even considering the fact that when you put kids who are... As you might say, displaying antisocial behaviour together—like in prison or in special education programs—behaviour gets worse. Again, keeping them in school with those who are doing satisfactorily is the best defence. Also this doesn't even consider major differences between ethno-cultural subgroups as well as dominant white culture. The issue is very complex and embedded in geographical issues, socio-historical injustice, and ongoing discrimination experiences. The answer again based on the evidence is to keep them in school and out of the prison system. I'm concerned that these laws will inflate the issues because what constitutes as adult crime will not be clear. What constitutes breaking and entering—the most common method of car theft is simply entering through unlocked doors. *Edited to repost a comment I made on another post which outlines some of the reasons why the policies are based in talking points, not evidence, and have the potential for damaging consequences.
2. These policies focus on rehabilitation rather than prevention. While these initiatives are good, sticking a bandaid on the cuts isn't going to make the blade go away. Labour's free lunch program would be a more effective approach to reducing youth crime. Children who aren't hungry are better able to learn and stay engaged in school. We've all experienced how difficult it is to focus or work while hungry. When children have full bellies, their engagement in school is stronger, leading to less youth crime. Statistically, reports have shown that free lunches directly provides: \- 17% reduced suspensions (in minorities) \- Average higher grades (mostly in Math) [\[source\]](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/schoolwide-free-meal-programs-fuel-better-classroom-outcomes-for-students/) Theres a good number of other studies, but I really can't be bothered.
3. I am opposed to you in every way, which I hate to have as an opening statement. I know you are trying, but the implementation of such things is impossible. Giving kids school lunches means they have to be at school to get them. Who is going to enforce this nonsense? It's great if your kids are fine upstanding citizens (like all mine are, farque) but delinquent kids come from delinquent parents. You can lead a horse to water, but it will still eat your cheeks when hungry. Or something.
4. Bruh, I work in resi homes. Dual carers is going to do fuck all 🤣 but good luck finding the staff to work in them anyway.
5. In going to double down here. Who is enforcing this regulated system. It's fecking great if your kids just want to go to the library anyway (or play video games), but if they are huffing some brain drain nonsense, mum and dad won't talk, grandma is the only one who makes them sandwiches and onlyfans seems like an easy solution you got bigger problems
6. Triple tap. Some kids are just munted. They need to be away from their ghoulish parents.
7. I don't believe anything that comes from Newman mach 2
8. By definition, bloomers are born between 1946 - 1964, so the youngest is 60. Perhaps I'm being defensive because I'm mid 50s and definitely do not consider myself a boomer...
9. Weird how boomers are so educated, but they get their cars stolen by children. Amazed they haven't looked at a better way to just secure their car. I got a big ass dog, my rule is, if you get past the dog you can take what you want, you've earned it
10. According to National Seniors Australia, one third of voters in QLD are over 60, which is pretty nuts. No wonder QLD leans conservative.
11. Ah, but we can give them three square in jail... loophole
12. The same amount as now? Had my house broken into and cars stolen when the Newman government was in…didn’t go off crying about it, or blaming the government…thinking privatizing prisons and locking up 10 year olds will fix anything is nothing short of ridiculous though
13. Statistically more than today
14. And if they don’t read Murdoch; their mates do
15. I mean do they though? Sure, [news.com.au](http://news.com.au) is the most read Murdoch site but it's also relatively non-ideological, compared to the curious snail or the \`strayan.
16. I have lived in Tasmania. I love it and may move back there shortly. Libs improved it dramatically.
17. All that as someone who lives 6000km away. Lol
18. My god, talk about brainwashed. Fucking lol
19. Actually, I'm not affiliated with the LNP at all, or any other party. I vote purely for whomever will best serve my interests. Also I support women's rights to abortion. I do not support the climate lunacy that is priortizing spending on something that is inevitable over cost of living and quality of life. Looks like I touched a nerve though.
20. How much you wanna bet a fair portion of them were just a couple years ago "doing their own research" on mRNA vaccines and 5G...
21. Yup. This. It's so hard to get someone out of the murdoch cult once they get in it.
22. QLD - if Texas and Florida had a child
23. I at least take comfort in there being savvy folks and in no small number. Unfortunately that number is likely still a minority. The average person walking down the street is really not that smart...
24. I would absolutely put money on it not happening. They know they’re on thin ice and have been given a bit of rope. They might tinker with mining royalties and other taxes, but it would be political suicide to criminalise abortion. They know that, and won’t do it.
25. They probably won't have the numbers now.
26. Norway has $1.71 Trillion in assets in it s sovereign fund from nationalised resources. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Pension_Fund_of_Norway Norway is the UK's biggest gas supplier https://www.sunsave.energy/blog/uk-gas-sources In 2024, Norway's oil and gas industry is expected to contribute nearly 24 percent to total GDP. In the period of consideration, figures oscillated between 10 and 35 percent. The industry is one of the most important in the country, making up a staggering 73 percent of Norway's export value in 2022. https://www.statista.com/statistics/1450033/oil-industry-share-of-gdp-norway/#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20Norway's%20oil%20and,Norway's%20export%20value%20in%202022.
27. Since you brought up Norway. The primary issue that this election decended into was abortion, do you care to know what the abortion laws are in Norway because they are significantly more restrictive then they are in QLD.
28. my bad, who owns the media nexus in the western world?
29. Your bigotry is strong.... cope and seethe
30. If he said it, it must be true...
31. There’s more to governance than housing. And so much of that is stuffed.
32. Some people are uneducated on the issues.
33. Oh ffs. Let’s not do this as well. Haven’t we suffered enough?
34. Victoria
35. None, most countries are starting to turn conservative. Possibly a rock off the coast may suit.
36. That’s fine, as the majority are conservative he would have no issue with the referendum.
37. Should be better than the lack of policy from the last 9 years. Youth crime only became an issue in SEQ after the many high profile deaths over the 2 years, this has been happening in regional QLD for 15 years. Labor’s policy is release all these awesome things right before an Election to buy the welfare and city votes. I’m glad regional qld saw through the bullshit and voted to change the status quo. And if he doesn’t stick to his promises then he’ll be another 1 term premier.
38. So what do you think is the solution to the families I have where every child has been incarcerated multiple times as both a child and an adult? Where the parents refuse services (which they are allowed to do and there is nothing we can do to force them)? Or where there are 7 and 8 services and agencies involved with the family and yet nothing changes. How do you propose breaking the cycle?
39. We live in one of the safest countries in the world in a state where crime is fairly dramatically trending down. I can poke fun of the fact that this has become a massive election issue and the death of a government given all this. It’s pretty embarrassing.
40. Crime happens everywhere dude. Youth crime is trending down. And even if it wasn’t, crime overall is dramatically trending down. You can’t stop crime completely and you’re a sucker if you think you can, an even bigger one if you think the LNP can. Of course people who love someone who’s been killed are going to be upset. Where did I suggest otherwise? Get a grip loser
41. Wrong, the regions had been entrenched labour voters for a long time. You also haven't considered the Katters are extremely pro environment and it's more likely it would allow them to grow across all of North Queensland.
42. Thanks for the response. I still am not convinced that this is evidence of a youth crime epidemic. Security camera footage has increased and is really being harnessed by the media. There are folks in my workplace that love sky news and channel 9, all they talk about is youtg crime. Those of us that are younger, live in the same suburbs and are more on the ABC side of things are not exposed to it at all and it is not even remotely a fear. Sorry to hear that you are afraid, wouldn't be nice. Cost of living crisis almost certainly leading up more crime in general, so it's not unjustified.

44. What do you mean it doesn't deter them? You weren't robbed.
45. Crime is indisputably down, you cannot argue with statistics. Correlation ≠ causation. Just because a phenomenon you don't like is happening doesn't mean it's the governments fault. "Adult crime = adult time" does absolutely nothing to address the root cause and will only breed more repeat offenders. Multiple studies have come to this conclusion. It's called recidivism.
46. Bro shut up. Your opinions aren't founded in truth. I don't care.
47. Energy market experts. Power grid experts. Nuclear experts. Power generation experts. Vs Dave on your Social Media feed who's "done his research". Ok.
48. "Experts" source the [csiro](https://www.csiro.au/en/news/all/articles/2023/december/nuclear-explainer) yeah id consider them experts and not what a bunch of twits on the internet said
49. 1. Wrong 2. Wrong 3. Wrong 4. Wrong. They're state parties. They have nothing to do with foreign relations. That's the federal government's job.
50. Take a hike
51. Nothing going to change that will have any real effect on your life, same shit new party. Stop your crying.
52. That's the point of your post, people must be brain dead or brainwashed by the media to vote for the party you don't like. If only they weren't stupid people they would think the same as a smart person like you does.
53. That doesn't sound left or right wing; just stupid.
54. You've betrayed both of them. What a shamefully bad parent.
55. Mainstream media create their own hype, and the viewers don't even realise it, then the world ends when other people critically think.
56. The coal royalties were offsetting most if not all of those expenses, and the state is in a surplus. That won't be a thing anymore, so those expenses will either be passed on to us, or the lnp will sack thousands of service workers like they did under Newman.
57. If it's so innocuous then why do people have the need to lie about their sex? We can stop being disingenuous - we know that impacts women when men start invading their safe spaces, sports, awards, prisons etc.
58. There’s literally nothing stopping a guy from walking into a woman’s restroom. Do you think there’s like a bouncer checking ID’s for that? As for prisons: I actually looked into that one and it’s done on a case-by-case basis (not hard to do when there’s an incredibly small amount of transgender offenders). They asses the potential risk of the person in question, to determine which prison they should go to. I’m sure in your head some burly guy is just declaring g in the court room floor that they’re a women to try get into their prison but it doesn’t work like that. You have to have already been known to be trans for years for the courts to consider it. And the fact of the matter is that any transgender woman that gets put in a mens prison *will* be raped. As for sports? I don’t know why that’s the governments business. If a sporting agency wants to allow or disallow athletes based on sex/what puberty a person goes through (I know some won’t allow trans women that have gone through male puberty but are fine with ones that started her earlier) then that’s really up to them. And again, we’re talking about a vanishingly small group of people. You really can just analyse them case-by-case.
59. >And what of the campaign that Labor ran? No, I'm talking about Crisafulli and the LNP.
60. I'm not contesting the result. The majority of our media is owned by one family with the same political stance, and you see no issue with that? You represent the average intelligence of an LNP voter.
61. You understand there are many other factors outside of just a government being a reason for crime going up, correct?
62. How is your perception of Labors political stance relevant to anything I have said? Without googling it, tell me what neoliberalism means.
63. Do you mean like finishing the most ambitious pumped hydro project in the world, projected to reduce our energy bills and provide us with energy diversity and security for the next century, all scrapped to prop up and protect our oligarchs and their interests? Or do you prefer it lining the pockets of multinational corporations who give zero shits about the countries and peoples that they extract the wealth from (e.g. Adani), or by giving Gina/Twiggy/Palmer some more intergenerational wealth off the backs of Queenslanders and our resources (and they'll be the first to leave the country if there is any resulting climate apocalypse).
64. Well it's not gonna used for shit now.
65. Lol, you may have to stop and charge a few more times to get to Burketwon. But seriously could we afford or would we accept the cost of a totally highway spec national grid. And why would a town of, what 300 people a gazillion k's from anywhere get a national highway standard road. I live regional not in the south east and know money gets spent based on population. In the last 3-4 years I have driven 80,000k's and our highway network is pretty dam good for our population.
66. Lol
67. How the fuck is it cope? I'm not in denial of the result. Imbecile.
68. It's rude to try and lecture me on what fascism is when it's clear as day you do not know the first thing about said fascism.
69. What is the cake supposed to represent?
70. Dude, you had two options. A party that was for the people, and a party that was for the coal mining industry. You chose the latter and get defensive when people call you stupid. Seriously?
71. *tomorrow's 👍
72. There are no clear-cut plans to ban coal. Even if that came to fruition, coal is not the only thing unearthed in this state. I don't understand your point.
73. It's hilarious that Labor shills don't see this.
74. 1. Stating that a liberal government will cut admin staff from hospitals 2. Implying/stating that doctors are unaffected by funding cuts. I’m saying that liberals in my view, are less likely to cut hospital funding. Even if they did, it is up to hospital administrators to decide how to save money or who to cut, not politicians. Regarding 2, I’m saying doctors already have been affected significantly by dwindling funding, although most have too much skin in the game to bother worrying about it.
75. So still not free then?
76. Boomer here. I've become even more left leaning than I was when I was young. And all my friends are similar. Best not to generalise. Saw hoards of young Liberals at the Liberal celebration last night. Don't think they'll be progressive now or ever.
77. I’m a boomer. Have always voted to the left. Interest that boomers are getting the blame when presumably in previous elections we somehow managed to get Labor elected. So tell me what has changed? I haven’t stopped voting ALP. Nor have my lefty boomer friends. The main difference is demographic. There are more younger voters. Yes. That’s what has changed. So maybe think a bit more deeply than just using prejudice to form your opinions.
78. Not all boomers.🙂 True though, I could count on one hand the number of left-leaning boomers I’ve met in the last 20 years. One possible explanation: An eye opener for me was during a few short-term gigs I did in central Queensland a few years ago, spending time in mining camps and the occasional pub or sports club. Every television set I walked past was set to a Sky channel, which I learned is a free-to-air network in the regions. It was fucken POISON, and seemingly inescapable. People would gormlessly sit and gawp at it during mealtimes, sometimes offering comments about African gangs (which almost none of those blokes would have had any experience of) and how they “don’t want to be welcome to my own country“, etc. The exception was sometimes seeing Koschy talk shit on Channel 7 in the mess hall at breakfast.
79. Generation what? Maybe don't use that word if you want to be taken seriously
80. Don't sit there pretending that you wouldn't have done exactly what boomers did if you were born at the same time. We will enjoy a better standard of living than our grandchildren, not because we are selfish but because by the time they are adults the world will have fewer resources and Australia and the world, will be more populated. That we have outgrown our planet is not one generation's fault.
81. Since the rich as fuck Fox execs got the jab, I figured it was safe enough for me
82. Exactly. So all these healthcare workers who only had two vaxxes are they now labelled anti-vaxxers because sure they are not on their 5th booster??
83. love it, package that in the next 3 slogan election campaign bonanza! You are hired !
84. Yeah, for people living on the edge, that $50 to $100 means something.
85. So, unless they can do something that fixes everything, they shouldn't try anything? How dare they try to ease cost of living slightly? The first step didn't magically change the world so just don't bother at all, huh?
86. I fact checked this since I thought it was an absolutely ridiculous number but you're actually right. A Guardian article from May 2023 outlines it really well. Lemme guess that more private prisons are coming to Qld? [article in question](https://amp.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/30/cost-of-keeping-queensland-child-in-custody-hits-2000-a-day-report-finds)
87. Honestly, if it's done properly in a good YDC like those being opened in Capricornia and Cairns, it's money we'll spent. These centres are nothing remotely like a prison. They are closer to a boarding school and give these kids a genuine chance to change. The sad thing is that these centres were only broke ground recently and won't be open until 2026 at the earliest. Think of the money that was wasted building covid detention camps that could have been redirectd into building more of these kinda of centres.
88. Kids that aren’t hungry may also have better education outcomes.
89. Yea heard that too. Which is basically going to result in more people using and addicted to meth which will lead to more crimes because most people aren’t going to take meth if they know it’s meth and it’s a super awful and addictive drug. But ya know I’m sure those 17-18 year olds deserve it for being young and curious and wanting to push boundaries as per their expected development… it’s their fault for trying pills in the first place…
90. I think that came from a specific case where even the judge wanted to hand out a bigger sentence but wasn't able to. The case in question is the murder of Emma Lovell, where the maximum sentence the judge was able to give out was 15 years, and even that required special authority. It's almost criminal that the violent thug who murdered a mother in her own home on boxing day 2022 by jaming a knife into her chest with such force that he snapped the blade off the handle will be out on parole before his 30th birthday while that family will suffer for a generation at minimum.
91. Are you saying jail time is not a deterrent? Sorry genuine question.
92. You didn't say 'more jail time is the forefront of the policy', though. You said it was their only policy.
93. That's a completely fair point. Please refer to the last paragraph of my post.
94. I'm not a liberal vote mate. I'm just trying to encourage conversations that are based in reality and an actual understanding of what the other side wants rather than strawmen like 'their only policy is more jail time'. I think parties should be criticised based on their actual positions and policies.
95. Okay, like I said if you want to argue it won't actually happen then fair enough
96. When I lived in Rockhampton it seemed about 20 years the rest of the industrialised world. So would that shift the generational boundaries?
97. Ok boomer ;)
98. I make sure my neighbours house look more desirable than mine :D
99. I'm removing this comment because I was insensitive to victims experiences
100. Where are those statistics?
101. I somewhat agree, but they are noted for inflammatory and emotionally manipulative language, and frequent enough occurrences of no sources, or poor sources https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/news-com-au/
102. What did they improve? Because they've had the reigns for the last decade, and all I've seen is more people on the streets as they do sweet fuck all about any real problems, all while they jerk off about their "strong plan" that's been in the making for as long as typewriters have existed.
103. So, if you voted for the LNP (I'm making an assumption, sorry if wrong), you voted against the party that has implemented not only the largest cost of living measures in the country, but also ensured they were all anti-inflationary so the situation wasn't exacerbated, all while having a budget surplus thanks to the mining tax... Voting against a party that had promised to purchase fuel stations and cause competition with publicly held stations and cap the daily price increase of fuel. Voting in favour of a government that has pledged to scrap the mining tax, thus returning us to a budget deficit while somehow paying for the promises they've made (probably Newman style service-cuts). So, we're going to have public services delivered less efficiently, with a budget deficit (because the mining tax was allowing all of these things), and this is in your best interest how? Because they are going to put more 12 year olds in prison, at $760,000 a year each? I really fail to see where anyone's interests are being served by this party other than mining companies (who are profiting from YOUR resources as an Australian citizen). Also, climate change is a very real threat, whether you believe it or not. As someone with a degree in Astrophysics and Environmental Sciences (double major), I'll say it can certainly be blown out of proportion by some advocacy groups, but the research does show that if it's not dealt with, there are definitely points of no return that would not be great for most life on the planet (Which is why we have reductions targets). Regardless, renewables are cleaner, cheaper and well, renewable... I really don't understand how anyone is opposed to less carbon in the atmosphere, less water being used for cooling, and less radioactive fly ash coming off coal plants.
104. You are a real monster. How bout you vote for others?
105. That research included Facebook posts from someone’s aunty, the Joe Rogan podcast and some QAnon page.
