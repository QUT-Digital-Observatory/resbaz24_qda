Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Yep, and how did the LNP do when they were in governance since the 80's? Hmm, and I wonder why Labor was in the majority over those years? Was it because they elected by the preference of the voters? Just as LNP were today? I'm apparently nearly as old as you according to other comments you've made. So yes, I was very much of voting age when Newman was in.
2. The entire construction industry is crooked, it's so well known it's practically a meme. It's interesting that the LNP only decided to make a fuss recently, and even more suss that they haven't looked any further than the union
3. I guess this is why they shouldnt fix the duke highway, it’s zero benefit to people that live inner/outer Brisbane electorates or many electorates within the state.
4. The point of the 50c fairs is that it also injects cash into the economy without raising inflation. Please use your brain next time.
5. That’s nice for you and all but for plebs like me who are permanently disabled and on payments way below the poverty line, it sure helps me get out of the house more.
6. eat a pile of shite.
7. Muppet
8. Why?
9. Why?
10. Why?
11. Because a public service is bad?
12. If you can get any sort of doco or psychologist to sign off saying you can't tap on and off, you can get one. Translink Access Pass.
13. Which parts are inaccurate out of curiosity?
14. Most of these kids aren't safe at home and are actively killing themselves persuing car thefts. What would you recommend is a good alternative? Group homes aren't working, the foster care system is underfunded/under supported and in some cases, equally as bad as home. These kids are chroming and mentally unstable. What alternative is there now?
15. Yeah I doubt it would've ever applied to rural schools.
16. Because it’s not a mandatory lunch. Those kids can still be sent to school with lunches provided by… there parents.
17. Wow, that would have to be one of the most populated state schools in the State, definitely not the norm! The average student enrolment for primary schools is well under 1,000. Even in high density areas! What school is this? The food is optional. Most kids won't line up for it. Those who do want/need breakfast or haven't had it provided will have access to it. Considering my school managed to handle kids ordering full blown meals consisting of hot foods for hundreds of kids a day... it really isn't that hard. Cereal and fruit covers all special dietary requirements that would be considered reasonable. If a child has such serious health issues that those two choices would screw them up, then it'd be simple to organise that with the school... just like we do for daycares that provide food. Fortunately only a small minority of children have dietary requirements.
18. Almost like it would create jobs in the process or something
19. No... no they don't. You can buy your kid tuckshop every day. Unless the tuckshop is closed due to lack of volunteers, you can just solve that by... paying people. Which would no doubt be included in the budget for it. So... the handful of regional state schools that go beyond Primary will feel pressured? I had never actually heard of that tbh. My brothers regional town has 1 state school and it still doesn't go over year 6 - They have 90 students in total. They just go to the regional high school after year 6 - Which takes the students of ALL the regional primary schools in their much larger catchment area (Highschools are designed to take larger numbers over larger catchment areas). It's really only private schools that do that? Could you show me some examples? I've just never seen that before even regionally. That's still not a valid reason to... not do it, in fact that's a good argument to expand it! Yes... naturally facilities will be expanded. That's what will happen. Problem solved! The funding isn't solely for food... because holy crap! There are apparently 326,000 primary school students in QLD. $1.4b... that'd be a $4,000+ food budget per kid per year. With 199 school days per year... that'd be $20 a day. Will they be treating the children to McDonalds every day? Realistically only about $5-$10 would go towards the actual 'food' part, while the rest would go towards the facilities to provide it.
20. There's tons of programs like this that's preventative. It's also providing healthy food to those who don't have healthy food, and if kids do have it rough they will go to school more knowing they can be fed.
21. We are not going to see mass deaths. Are people going to struggle? Absolutely. Should people be homeless in this country with all its wealth? Absolutely not. But we aren’t going to see mass starvation and famine and deaths in the streets. We aren’t going to have a Great Leap Forward or a Holodomor.
22. QLD has the cheapest power in Australia. Battery’s have been providing more stability to the grid then anything else has at a cheaper price.
23. >Oh that intermittent non baseload power... Funny how we have a cost of living crisis and power bills keep going up the more we will out renewables. You're doing a fantastic job at demonstrating to anyone who knows anything about how the NEM in Australia works that you have no idea what you're talking about, please do keep going.
24. Whine.
25. I live in the Yeppoon/Rockhampton area..... People here aren't methed up bogans. I know why they voted the way they did in my area/central Queensland. But don't put blanket blame on everyone in regional areas. A lot of people didn't know about the preferences which played a big part. Plus a new fresh face who has had a long term successful stint as a local councillor and high profile community member. There also has been a lot of youth crime in our area and wider central Queensland. The catchphrases stuck. Because the sentencing of young offenders is actually a problem. I've worked with young offenders. I feel so damn deflated about this election.
26. Gold coast is a lot to blame for this as well, not just regional areas
27. It's disappointing that's how you see anyone who lives north of you. Most methed up people don't bother voting.
28. Yes, meth heads watch Sky. 🤡
29. Blaming interstate migration for this election outcome is about the stupidest thing I’ve read on reddit of late. The swing is in areas with low interstate migration. Look to your own. Everyone I know that voted LNP was born here, me and my interstate and overseas migrant friends all voted Labor or greens. Not to mention that: - most aged care facilities would need to shut completely if there wasn’t migration - particularly in the regions. - police and health sectors are actively recruiting interstate the workforce can’t be found locally - many people move here to study from both overseas and interstate which is good for the economy and supports employment for all those in the sector or that service the sector. Hatred towards interstate migrants is such a backward QLD thing. There’s no laws stopping people from moving around Australia. Get angry at the right people, not people who are here actively helping and participating in society.
30. My bad, meant to reply to the main comment, but fat fingered it.
31. They definitely will go with Vic Park. I would bet everything I own on it.
32. Were either of those things happening under Labor?
33. Nope not a boomer. Fact is mate. Qlders have spoken. They gave ALP 12 years & thats enough Id say they lost Mackay because of the awful idea of destroying a beautiful valley for a hydro station. They lost North Qld because of our of control youth crime. People are just fed up with youth crime. Not being able to park their car in their own driveway. Having youths wandering the streets carrying big knives & machetes, getting a, slap on the wrist & let out to do it all again. People are sick of our places being renamed to Aboriginal names & people don't want a treaty. People didn't want to blow billions on Olympics... they didn't even ask Queenslanders. In fact? They just did what they wanted more and more without seeking thoughts from anyone. People had a gutful of that.
34. Don't care. According to ALP Qld has plenty of cash! They've been giving it away like it's a bottomless pit. Happy to pay to lock the little shits up
35. Democracy. This is how it works🙂
36. >not yours to make for 50% of the population… But you are also free to make choices on behalf of the rest of the population. You could apply that comment to everything.
37. Not sure of the point of this comment is. Fatherless? My dad was a wonderful man & person. I don't think he did anything dishonest in 85 years! And I'm a mother. Not a father.
38. They knew. I think it’s a choice a lot of people will come to regret, but it was theirs to make.
39. Uhhh so a woman is asking for it if she wears a dress that a man considers too revealing?
40. At this point, they've just made a night of it (and past few days at least) trollbaiting around the different subreddits so not a lot to be had arguing/debating with them. I wasted my own time tonight already, letting myself be engaged by it.
41. Tbf, it's my understanding that most of those roles were administrative.
42. We could save enormous money with this mindset. If it doesn't help everyone, it's a waste of money. Just give me rebates and cash back. Works for me.
43. The point of the 50c fares was to buy votes in Brisbane. People in the regions saw it as yet another slap in the face and reminder that they don’t matter to Labor.
44. And what about all the disabled people living in the rest of the state who can’t access this?
45. I'm used to it...ALP had us all eating shit for years
46. Inefficient use of capital.
47. Inefficient use of funds is bad. They know it's a waste of money. Miles brought it in a mad dash to try to buy votes because he knew he was going to lose and didn't care about the consequences. Cris said he would keep for a term to make it a non voting issue despite knowing it's a bad policy.
48. thank you!
49. First of all the last time the QTU took strike action was pre Newman.
50. It would have but it would have involved partnering with local businesses like a cafe or even just someone who can do the food.
51. Why are you talking about cereal and fruit? The proposal was for ‘hot’ school lunches, not an easy pour out of a box breakfast.
52. I live in a regional city and there are several primary schools with over 1000 students. These size primary schools are fairly common. I work at a school with half that and it would still be hell on earth to supply those free lunches. To create that food they would have to build a whole new tuck shop and hire several new people to run it and even then the time it would take to distribute each day to kids in prep, 1 and 2 would be insane. When there is a birthday and we have to hand out slices of cake to prep kids, it can take half an hour. Where are we going to find the time to do that three times in the day. Prep, 1s and 2s would also likely drop a plate, some don’t know how to use a fork. There are also no tables to sit at, just benches. It would likely mean the kids loosing out on at least an hour of learning to make it happen. There just isn’t the time in the school day. I love the idea, but it was said in the moment with no consultation with schools and no plan on how to practically deliver it on the ground. Oh and it was meant to start term 1 next year. As if the new facilities would be built by then.
53. In the Sunny coast, quite a few of our state primary schools have over 1000 kids. Talara, Buderim, Coolum, Peregian, Baringa to name a few. Of course it’s optional but most parents would take advantedge of it at various points throughout the year. I would imagine Fridays would be a pretty popular day. I don’t think it’s a bad idea, would just be hard to navigate at organise at big schools.
54. Goomeri P10 State School Kilkivan P-10 State School Wondai P-9 State School Yarraman P-9 State school Woodford P-10 State School Dirranbandi P-10 State School Tin Can Bay P-10 State School Texas P-10 State School Allora P-10 State School Injune P-10 State School Alpha P-10 State School Aramac P-10 State School Baralaba P10 State School Bell P-10 State School Biggenden P-10 State School Cecil Plains P9 State School Crows Nest P10 State School Dimbulah P-10 State School Doomadgee P-10 State School Herberton P-10 State School Inglewood P-10 State School Injune P10 State School Jandowae P-10 State School Killarney P-10 state school Kowanyama P10 State School Mary valley state college (P10) Millmerran p10 State School Miriam Vale P10 State School Mitchell P10 State School Mornington Island P10 State School Mount Larcom p-10 State School Mundubbera P10 State School Normanton P-10 State School Proston P10 State School Quilpie State School (P10) Quinalow P10 State School Richmond state school (P10) Springsure P10 Surat P10 Tambo P10 Taroom P10 Theodore P10 Wallumbilla P10 Wandoan P10 Yarrabah P10 Those are just the P9 and P10 schools. P12s include an awful lot of very, very large schools. And no, lots of rural schools literally have tuckshop once a week or a fortnight and only what the P&C parents provide. Lots of rural schools don’t have the facilities to make food at school.
55. What data
56. Who the fuck said death? I’m talking about surviving financially. Context clues.
57. How much have power prices gone up in the past 4 years?
58. More like wine... I'm celebrating tonight with the majority of QLD.
59. I've been assaulted twice, I know youth crime. Methed up bogans yup.
60. Yes. Cashed up bogans on the GC voting with no conscience
61. Yeah true, ancient fucking boomers.
62. As a frequent user of public transport, my transport expenditure went from small but significant, to virtually non-existent under them, so that was pretty good for cost of living.
63. Will the LNP make them go down? No. Could Labour? No. The world is on the brink of war. Those things aren't going to just improve But LNP will fuck with abortion laws and cut necessary services such as drug diversion. Fucking idiots
64. This ^ Anyone who thinks any politician regardless of party actually cares needs to take a step back.
65. That’s completely different and you know it. Leaving your doors and windows open is completely stupid and the perfect way to let someone in and by the way this isn’t a new thing there’s always been people who would take advantage of the access.
66. It could be just as good as the US healthcare system.
67. You want a magic bus way to be built in other areas of the state? With your "whataboutism" nothing would ever improve for anyone unless it could improve for everyone at the same time. Which if you have half a brain you'll know isn't possible.
68. You want to take something away from group A that benefits them because group B can’t access it? Do you realise how fucked that is?
69. Nah, but newman did.
70. Yeah man those mining royalties that paid for so many benefits really knocked the stuffing outta ordinary Qlders..
71. Prepare for a massive increase in quantity and
72. No problem. Happy to help you apply if you need!
73. So they claim. Not all rural places would be able to accommodate it is the point.
74. Sorry, my bad... I was stuck on the long-standing policy of the Greens with breakfast. Still does not change anything... as schools already provide hot school lunches. They just accept payment for them. Has no one against this ever had tuckshop before or something?
75. Go watch some videos on Japan schools. They provide lunch for the school kids and have no problems at all. Kids in the class room, whilst waiting for their meal they tidy up the classroom to pre pare for the meal. The teacher dishes up the meals. And they all sit and eat together including the teacher. Yes there will be hurdles but it will be worth it. Not only does it insure all kids get a meal a school it's also helps parents as they no longer have to worry about having the money / food for their kids lunch. It will also teach kids responsibility and some basic respect.
76. No, they're not. Name them. Because we can check the enrolment numbers as they're public. I know Sunnybank Hills is one of the most populated state primary schools and they have 1,500 something students... but that's not a regional school, that's in a city. That's not the norm. I'm in Townsville atm, a large regional city... and so far none over 1,000 students. Logically... regional state schools would not have greater numbers than metropolitan schools... because the populations are way smaller. So again... say the name of the state school, we can check them. Also, tuckshop isn't delivered 'on a plate' - Not unless you're in a private school (Do they do that?). In my primary school in the 00s, you got it in a brown paper bag (the same one you wrote your order on) and you ate it with your hands. Why would it happen 3 times a day? Damn dude, are you talking about private schools? Because in state schools you have 1 lunch break (longer) and then 1 afternoon tea (shorter). State school tuckshops tend to be staffed by volunteers, usually parents of the children. I volunteered at the primary school tuckshop for my work experience in highschool, and we successfully and (very easily) cooked about 200+ hot meals a day. It wasn't a 3 course meal bro... it was things like cheese toasties, hot pies, sausage rolls and chips. I wish I went to your school as a kid though. 😂 3 lunches! Birthday cake! Plates and cutlery! Damn.
77. Yea, to name a few. That's the point. There are over 900 primary state schools in QLD. Some schools would need more resources to roll it out, but presumably, they've still been providing hundreds of orders of tuckshop food a day already... it really wouldn't be that big of a difference. My former state primary school had 800 children. When I volunteered for tuckshop, me and 2 other volunteers easily provided about 200+ hot lunches a day. You're not using an easy bake oven, or making 3 course meals. I'm not sure where people are seeing 'hot lunches' though... all the articles I've read just say 'lunches' - So even easier!
78. All those schools don't even have many students...? Kilkivan only has 62 students over Primary??? There are only 94 Primary + Secondary schools... so 10% of schools. So you want to not give lunches to 90% of state schools because 10% of schools have Primary + Secondary together? That seems super fucked up dude.
79. Unfortunately you're laughing at the slop they would eat without seeing a menu, so I already know that providing you with info is not gonna change your mind. No point wasting my time on you. Call up the services or headspace but fuckoff if you wanna question it without looking into it yourself
80. Still cheapest in Australia my man. It’s all comparative. Also we have the best solar rebates too. Or had. Might be cut now.
81. How much less has power prices gone up in Queensland compared to other states?
82. Sure bud, you and gina rinehardt the KFC miner must be having fun.
83. I'm so sorry you've been assaulted. Especially to be assaulted twice. That's so horrible. I hope you didn't have major injuries and you're doing okay now. I've been sexually assaulted before and the Labor coercive control law changed my life. It gave me freedom.
84. The sad part is it’s not even the cashed up people (bogan or otherwise) voting LNP here. It’s people who perceive themselves to be cashed up. People are voting against their own interests, with know idea that they are shooting themselves in the foot. There are people voting to have their own kids locked up, which they’ll realise once it’s too late.
85. Yup unfortunately my area now. Live in a suburb that was full of young families, young couples and single people years ago and is now overrun with boomers, who vote LNP (and was proven in the results) I hate it here
86. It really isn't. Stop tryinging to justify yourself. Breaking in isn't legal because a door is open just like it's not legal to take advantage of a woman because of her "asking for it". Your words in regards to leaving the door unlocked was they would be asking for it. Don't back away now. You used the phrase own up to it.
87. Don't knock it till you've tried it!
88. I personally think that introducing public transport that connects more of the state would help disperse the population which we need to do. I personally think that an investment in high speed rail connecting regional centres with Brisbane would be a worthwhile investment that perhaps would have shown regions that Labor actually values them and that also makes regional centres a more attractive place to live.
89. Benefits for whom?
90. It did affect mining towns, companies canceled expansion and didn’t renew contracts. Just because city dwellers don’t see youth crime and lack of infrastructure and investment doesn’t mean they aren’t an issue. Labor have just realised they can’t focus on the city and neglect rural and still win an election. Have a look at the election map, labor won Brisbane city and outliers and almost no other. Let this be a lesson to both majors that you can’t forget the rural electorates.
91. I should be able to manage it, thanks. But if I can't, I'll get back to you. (There's so many times as someone with ADHD, I'd swipe on and forget to swipe off travelling one zone so they charged me maximum).
92. On the contrary, I’m on a committee that runs our school tuckshop. I know how much more infrastructure we would need to serve a hot lunch to 700 kids a day (as opposed to the 150 a day who order a mix of sandwiches, snacks and minimal hot food, and we are only opened 4 days a week). The upfront capital cost would be massive, and a complete waste compared to the infrastructure our school actually needs. We would need a lot more employees (volunteers are hard to come by as it is), which would also increase the costs over and above what we already have per item. Lastly we are in a demographic that definitely does not need this type of handout and it concerns me that this will not address the true reasons kids are going to school hungry, but will give free things to those that have plenty already.
93. Where did I say I didn’t want to give lunches? I’m merely pointing out that the actual policy doesn’t take into account the wide variation of school types in QLD, and the fact that these schools cannot afford to provide food for their secondary students out of their budget, and that in rural schools they don’t actually have capacity to offer tuckshop so how will they do this? It was made very clear that there would be no additional staffing allocation to schools to support this. And positioning people actually in schools who point out their concerns with this policy as “not wanting to feed children” is ridiculous posturing. I mean, how is a school tuckshop like Kelvin Grove State College’s supposed to prepare 1500 meals for its primary while ALSO preparing orders for its secondary, and have all the necessary recruitment and infrastructure expansion completed by January? How was the Miles government going to complete this expansion by January when schools have holidays in 6 weeks and therefore principals and business managers are not working?
94. They were already being cut.
95. That's right comparative to the rest of the world. We can't manufacture anything here because we are not competitive on a world stage. Largely due to energy costs despite being blessed with ample land and some of the best natural resources in the world.
96. Yeah, I wish so bad I could just be able to buy a chunk of land somewhere and make my own town where you can't be a right wing nutjob, and where only non fuckwits live. I'd love to. But instead, I have to listen to Nancy on the bus tell us how one of her friends got broken into 2 years ago and how her cigarettes' are so expensive.
97. If the doors open it’s not breaking in
98. I don’t need to make all of my own mistakes, I can learn from others mistakes.
99. Look, obstensibly I agree with you. I am a huge fan of trains. But high speed rail is expensive so they aren't going to build it to regional areas with low uptake. Primarily because this kind of stuff is build on demand. People have to move there first, but people won't move there first if there's no mass public transport. Chicken and egg etc. There's been talking of high speed rail between sydney and melbourne for ... decades? And they won't even do that...
100. People who aren't billionaires. The Miles government actually did what a government is supposed to do and used the mining royalties to go towards queenslanders. It supported the many, not the few.
