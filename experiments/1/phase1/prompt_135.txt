Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. The people with those rare moderate LNP members should consider reaching out to them about their abortion stance. This might be the only way to protect abortion rights.
2. Libs don't care as they aren't serving you they are serving donors and business interests.
3. If anything, this should be a wake up call for both parties to look after regional areas. Labor neglected regional and spoiled the city and it shows by the results, I think they’ll get 1 or 2 electorates outside Brisbane city. Regional electorates won this election for LNP and they’d be foolish to neglect them over the next few years. Time to keep them honest to their word.
4. How delicious it is to watch the SE corner cry babies.
5. Tell me u can't accept defeat without telling me
6. i wished my outgoing labour MP well. i’m so so upset he’s out but i’m so proud of what he’s accomplished. Same with Miles. Miles didn’t have long but he was a hero to so many people. This elections result sucks but I hope it’s a wake up call for this state. We’ll realise how much LNP is shit and we’ll move through the olympics without them
7. Good point. I'll message my ALP member and advise my dissatisfaction that they ran on scare campaigns of abortion, mining royalties and public service job cuts.
8. So we are writing to we only value the opinions of those that are the same as ours? Never would I have believed such a meltdown would occur by people that didn’t get their way.
9. Pls update your original post. Its not 3 years but actually 4 years of liberal tears 😭
10. I wrote to my local ALP member when I was having issues with my REA/ real estate agent privacy and stealing our information and issues with mould in a house and he never replied. I voted labour and have since day dot but my local member is lazy
11. The majority of Queensland voted for these policies. Putting aside the "under new management" part, perhaps you could try to align with the policies that are closest to your values. Eg. The social housing policies, education improvements, investments in social services are all quite progressive. Small L liberal policies. Politics are much more about common ground. If Labor spent as much effort fixing the youth crime or ambulance ramping problem as they spent saying that there wasn't a problem then (in the spirit of finding common ground with the other side) they'd probably have been reelected.
12. Have you stopped to consider that people voted based on their own interests and not based on scare campaigns? I mean, sure, a lot of people vote for whatever, but a large number of people that I know voted for the LNP for very sound and rational reasons. Note: I did not vote LNP
13. It's funny how everyone claims manipulation. Maybe some people actually like the party.
14. Cope and seethe
15. Fun fact that I don’t think many people in qld seem to understand. THERE IS NO HUMAN RIGHT TO ABORTION IN AUSTRALIA, just laws created and enforced by each state territory. When you get out and touch some grass, MOST people are extremely uncomfortable with the thought of a VIABLE foetus being aborted for a NON-MEDICAL EMERGENCY post 5/6 months (non of the recent changes to laws proposed anywhere I’ve seen effected medical emergencies, but happy to be shown I am wrong). In fact, if you have got time for a little reading. These are the stories that are why abortion seems to be back in the news. I can’t understand how anyone can see one story like this and not think laws need immediate change to protect the foetus, here is some quick stats from the available data in a 2023 study. babies left to die post a failed abortion 2010-2020; WA- 27 QLD- 328 (wtf qld) 396- VIC (WTF vic) ON AVERAGE EVERY WEEK IN QLD AND VIC A BABY IS BORN ALIVE FOLLOWING A FAILED ABORTION. But women’s right to choose, her body, etc etc more important.
16. My candidate is the face of the LNPs youth crime policy, Russel Field or whatever. Should be interesting to see what a retired almost 70 year old tradie has planned to reduce the “youth crime” that was already reducing under Labor.
17. Get back on your meds. This is some serious derangement. Labor is toxic and was failing. Overspending, useless on crime, bad energy policy and sought too much control and spread too much fear through the pandemic. Conservative is what we need and the amount of unhinged cope from this sub has made me remember why I dont follow it anymore.
18. What a tantrum rant.
19. You need to get over your loss for a good reason and respect the democracy in your state. That’s all
20. \> Do not let Labour go quietly into the night. unbelievable cringe
21. They don't care what you think
22. Geez dude. It’s a change of government, not the end of the world.
23. Communicate with your local Lying Nasty Party member at your own peril: Anything you say, especially differing to their views, can and will be used against you.
24. Send literal turds to any LNP office.
25. Oh FFS, get over yourself. You lost a state election.
26. Sure. One example of "powerful manipulative messaging and coordinated misinformation" is how so many people seem to think that coal royalties are some magic money tree that is paying for all kinds of policies when anyone can look up the state budget or coal prices and see that coal prices and royalties have dropped massively and that the govt has been taking on debt that we'll all be paying back at some point with either higher taxes, lower services or a combination or the 2.
27. The fed is next. Bye bye ALBO.
28. Good so many woke hand wringers on here. Move on with your lives and preferably get a job. It's a democracy, you lost!
29. The same things, ideally. Express how you want them to keep fighting against LNP's braindead policy.
30. Meaghan Scanlon?
31. Give them condolences for the 7+% swing against them.
32. Sounds like Shannon Fentiman?
33. Damn. Sounds like a great place to send your junk mail, then.
34. I give it a year at most. But we'll probably stop hearing about it sooner coz why report on it when LNP won?
35. Yeah about 24 hours mate .
36. Damn I really can picture it now. He'll point out that the CM hasn't reported a single case of youth crime in a year or something and call that a win.
37. It’s fine if you’ve never experienced this crime, try taking a bus or train in the city out of the city, not from station to station from Brisbane to rosewood, my brother was robbed on the train shoes phone jumper. I had a junkie try and steal my fake ass chain in Caboolture, walked to a maccas and he stsrted kicking in the glass. I know countless people whose houses have been robbed in the night, to think it dosent matter because it’s not happening to you.
38. They'll keep reporting it. News ain't so profitable they can afford not to. It'll just still be labor's fault somehow.
39. Fantastic tips and ones I intend to follow. I wish I'd added this to the original post! Definitely a BIG underscore to writing politely and respectfully. They're people as much as we are, and don't deserve hate mail.
40. Exactly this. Just keep the conversation going and the pressure on.
41. They literally said it wasn't on the table in unequivocal fashion. Wtf more do you need to hear?
42. Yeah, a fair call. I do hope the LNP follows through and looks out for our regional friends. We're all QLDers and we all deserve a government that looks after us equally.
43. Go for it. Just coz I support ALP doesn't mean I condone their scare campaigns. All of that went in my rubbish bin, too.
44. We'll be storming the phallic symbol before you know it.
45. It's not like I'm not allowed to be dissatisfied. You'd do/feel the same thing if ALP managed to get a 4th term.
46. I saw it coming a mile away.
47. I'm not sure if your local MP is the person to go to for that. There are regulatory boards to go to first.
48. Democracy doesn't begin and end at voting. Being part of a democracy gives me the right to speak openly about my opinions. That's the whole bloody point.
49. Would you have preferred I say something like "Don't let LNP skibidi their gyatts for the rizzler?"
50. Sounds like being a sore loser. Accept defeat and know that the world still goes on and your team can try a different strategy next time.
51. That could get you in trouble, please don't.
52. Packing some shit for them now.
53. Hm, yes, I am in 300 dollars of debt, and only receive 50 dollars a week. 10 of that comes from my friend. Time to tell him to stop giving me money! That'll help!
54. The government hasn’t been borrowing due to falling coal prices. Recent high coal prices brought in record revenue, helping create a budget surplus. The current debt is funding long-term infrastructure and services, not covering an immediate drop in coal revenue. However, with coal prices expected to fall, the government would probably need to rely more on debt to sustain this level of spending in the future. https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/100536 “Queensland’s improved fiscal position reflects higher coal royalties on the back of high global prices… The additional revenue has allowed the Government to manage cost-of-living measures and maintain a budget surplus without taking on new debt for these purposes.” Where are you sourcing your info from dude?
55. As an opposition party, isnt that what they are doing already
56. No. Fentiman.
57. It was only 4.2% though?
58. Or my bowel test kit
59. Murdoch doesnt want peace and quiet. Newslimited builds its business model on dividing the population and creating drama so they get more clicks. They'll turn on the LNP at some stage. Got to keep that 24/7 news cycle going. Miles or Crusifilli could announce they have a cure for cancer and the Courier Mail would start complaining about the negative effect on Pharma, Oncology and Funeral businesses. Newslimited is a virus that has infected this country (and several others) and whoever allowed Sky news to be shown on free to air in regional areas should be locked up.
60. Oh sorry, I'm not saying it's not happening, trust me I know it's happening, what I'm saying is now that the LNP is in and they were using it and its victims to get votes we'll start seeing it reported less and less on the news until it's either pushed back to the last 5 minutes or not at all.
61. True, I didn't think of that.
62. If Katter tries it and DC shuts it down, good. If Katter tries it and DC allows it, it shows all that he absolutely can not be trusted Is their ideology stronger than their word?
63. I want them to say they'll vote against katter's vote to recriminalise abortion. They're an anti-abortion party and I absolutely do not trust them on this issue until they explicitly state that they will not support Katter.
64. “We do not support the re-criminalisation of abortion and as the leader of the LNP I will not allow a conscience vote on this issue for my colleagues.” If he said that then he would have won more seats. Instead, he left it very open to interpretation. “It’s not part of our plan.” Cool, but if it’s part of the KAP plan (which Katter had confirmed it was) then the LNP can allow a conscience vote and say “well it wasn’t our plan.”
65. Ah no. Because I can’t vote here. Would not have cared in the slightest. End of the day you can be hysterical about the election but you also do have to accept the result and the opinions of others. End of the day, democracy occurred. One team won, the other lost. Accept it.
66. Unhappy yes. Your level of hysteria, god no
67. And I went to those first, it’s been 12 months of BS. It’s been recommended to by QSTARs and RTA and a rental advocate.
68. It does begin with voting but it indeed doesn’t end there.
69. Massive LOL at you OP and every other instant political activist who has suddenly coalesced out of the ether in the wake of what was a predictable outcome. Where the fuck were you all in the lead up to it? Why weren't you hitting the streets & door knocking or standing on footpaths waving corflutes? Why only now do you seem to care? The parade of seething & infantile rage posts or calls to arms are as hollow as they are attention seeking. All this bullshit about writing to your member to challenge policy from a government that isn't even sworn in is laughable.
70. honestly yes lmaooo
71. Gracious in defeat. I can only imagine the seething if someone did this to the Greens or Steven Miles.
72. I'd like to hope so, but just sitting back and expecting any politician to work in your best interest is niave at best
73. I hope she wins the leadership vote!
74. Give them 4.2% of condolences then.
75. The cure gets announced and they come out saying it's bad because it takes doctors jobs away
76. He literally said, 'we ruled it out...the laws will remain the same'. It's on public record. I'm happy to wager that there is no change to the abortion laws during this term to anyone who is willing. Will have a lawyer draft up a contract, we split lawyer costs and money to be held in escrow.
77. Democracy doesn't just begin and end at voting. As part of a democratic society we also have the right to express our dissatisfaction and communicate with our politicians. I accept that LNP won. That doesn't mean I have to change my opinion nor be quiet about it. That's the entire point of a democracy.
78. Crikey, if encouraging people to calmly write to their MP is "hysteria" now...
79. Well, let me know how it goes when you write to your LNP member.
80. Hence "Write to your local MP".
81. So if it's not fair to do it now, when is it fair to do it?
82. I'm fuckin tempted to edit it now
83. fuck that let miles feed em
84. Correct. But the entire point of democracy is everyone is equal. Your dissatisfaction is worth only as much as someone’s satisfaction. As I said you can act as you please, however as someone who doesn’t vote here, but will one day (and is really on the fence on who I will vote for), the actions in this sub this morning have really turned me away from ALP. So bear in mind, denial (not what you are doing but there is a lot of that here), complaining when literally nothing has happened yet and the jumping to conclusions can have a huge negative effect to the cause you are trying to achieve. Nobody wants to associate themselves with sore losers, which is very much the vibe here. Me personally, I’ll see what the next four years brings and as I’ll likely be eligible to vote by then, have a far more informed vote. As we haven’t even started seeing any policy come to fruition. But it’s been eye opening to see how the ALP supporters (granted it’s Reddit) react to a loss. Particularly when if you live for 80 years, about 40 of them your side wins and 40 your side will lose.
85. About what. They have not started yet
86. I never mentioned fairness, do as you will, I'm just questioning the timing of it all (which you completely ignored).
87. I want Miles to stay as leader but don't think it's likely.
88. Your first point is valid, but again that doesn't mean I'm not allowed to express my dissatisfaction. Also, this sub is pretty heavily ALP leaning, so you were going to see these attitudes here anyway. It's not about being a sore loser, it's about lamenting the introduction of a party that wants to lock up kids, ban abortions, and bankrupt the state. I'm not sure how you see my willingness to engage in the democratic process as denial, either. I accept the LNP won and that's the party we will deal with for the next 3 years. If I didn't, why would I encourage you or anyone else to make noise about policies that affect them? Is that not the same as the media reporting over the last 30 days? Find an LNP leaning subrddit and you'll see an equal display of echo-chamber toxicity. But this isn't a sports game. You don't just come away from it and go "Oh well, better luck next time." This is politics, and you *can* make a difference by talking about it and participating. If you want to write in support of LNP, KAP, ONE or whatever, that's your democratic right. Don't just expect or rely on your vote to epxress the nuance of your opinion or position.
89. Mate I'm not gonna re-read my posts or comments to you. You can do that yourself.
90. So me asking /when/ is ignoring the timing of it? So I should just give up because "Oh boo hoo it's too late?" As stated above, in my many comments, you can be active politically whenever. Every little bit helps. Shitting on the effort made by others because you couldn't be bothered to join in yourself isn't helping. Were you on the streets banging on about youth crime and abortions? If not, what gives you any right to comment? Also wild that an account created yesterday is having a sook about people 'coming out of the ether'. Lmao, the hypocrisy is strong with this one.
91. Yeah... I think it would be a mistake though. I think he'll be good to have in opposition.
92. Miles will stay on.
93. There is a bit of upside to him staying on. I hope he stays.
94. Well Gary Bullock will have something to say about that.
95. Oh I’m in Right leaning subs. And they certainly don’t carry on like this at all (after the Federal election they lost). It certainly portrays being a sore loser from what we’ve seen this morning. People wanting the state to split, it’s mass hysteria. Secondly the amount of misinformation that is spread here is wild. The abortion “issue” has been said quite clearly the laws are not going to change. And bankrupting the economy? On what grounds? Are they going on a spending spree and printing money to do it? Because that’s the first I’ve heard of it. You don’t have to believe what they say but you certainly should not be spreading or implying that they will. It is literally misinformation. I think you can quite clearly see now, why I have my doubts about the ALP support base and do I want to be associated with that.
96. I hope so but my next favourite for leader is definitely Shannon
97. Sure, if they want a petulant child that can’t lose gracefully to run the party.
98. I'm huge team Miles and if I could cast a leadership vote for him I would
99. We must be on different subs then, coz I've seen my fair share of sore losers from both sides. I've been around long enough to know the last time LNP was in power, we had a bad bloody time. The Newman government pretty famously suffered big controversies, (check out the ridiculous anti-bikie stuff), cut so-called 'frontline' jobs, and privatised schools and hospitals. So don't blame me for expecting more of the same from his ilk. The LNP has a long and storied history of going back on promises and looking out for the 1%. But if they do in fact stick to the promises about not changing abortion and do fix the budget, then I'd happily change my tune. I'm not immune to reason. I just don't expect that to be the case based on my past experience with them. If you don't like the ALP, that's fine. Like we've established, it's your right to believe what you want and vote/behave accordingly. Just don't take the actions of one group after one event as representative of a whole. I'd like to think I'm at least trying to encourage helpful dialogues, rather than posting silly anti-LNP memes. I don't want to be inflammatory or otherwise; just remind people they can still use their voices post election.
100. That message conveniently spoon fed to you by Sky / Nine / Courier Mail.
101. It’s not that I don’t like the ALP. I actually think Albo has done really well at Federal level and am surprised the polls have LNP ahead now across the nation. That was a tough time to come in post Covid after all Western Nations really shat the bed (for lack of a better term) in how they handled Covid. And him and Chalmers have done well to navigate the headwinds of rejuvenation of the economy whilst keeping inflation somewhat in check. As I said, I’m surprised Dutton and LNP are leading in all polls now. What I’m not happy with is how toxic the QLD ALP supporters have been with the outcome overnight. It’s actually borderline concerning. America Lite kind of thing.
102. Oh cry me a river Labor bogan
103. Yeah I'll concede that, and my part in it. I'm just hoping to foster more productive ways of using that disappointment, rather than having a big sook online and screaming for state splits and riots. That's not the way, and not conducive to healthy democracy. I'll also admit my initial wording of this post was probably more... inflammatory (?) than I expected, reading it now. It's easy to get caught up in the emotion of it all, and you're right to point out that kind of behaviour for what it is.
104. [removed]
105. Yeah that's fair. I think it's good to be involved in politics and take an interest in it, but you're right in that it can be very dangerous to let emotion get the better of us. Having said that, I think us Aussies are generally quite whingy, anyway. It's a national pass time in some places!
106. I swear I tried getting my friend to vote but he was all like “nah they’re both bullshit anyway” and “I’m not registered to vote so I’m not going too.” whilst agreeing with Labor policy… dumbass.
107. Miles was never your enemy regional QLD. Gina and Sky News was. Ask your local member where all your money up north was going. And more importantly, where it's going to go now. Ask why all the FIFOs aren't investing locally. Ask where all the hundreds of millions in tourism bailouts actually went that we paid for. Love, your city slicker tax-payer, who gets to pay to fly your asses down here for routine health stuff :)
108. Let's not forget this little gem that's resulted in Crisafulli being referred to the Parliamentary Ethics Committee... Mr Crisafulli was being pursued by the Federal Coalition Government for insolvent trading while he was sole director of SET Solutions. Mr Crisafulli paid $200,000 to stop those legal proceedings in a confidential settlement so Queenslanders didn’t find out. Documents filed to the company regulator reveal the $200,000 was paid to liquidators in three payments between $60,000 and $80,000. Two of those payments were made while he was shadow minister and one while he was Opposition Leader. Mr Crisafulli has not publicly admitted he made those payment or declared the liability on his parliamentary register of interests which at the time had a limit of under $20,000. Public records also show Mr Crisafulli was a Minister in the Newman Government when he funnelled a $320,000 grant to SET Solutions. A year later Mr Crisafulli was sole director of SET Solutions, a position he held for four months. The director that replaced Mr Crisafulli, placed the company into liquidation the following month. The company owed $2.7 million to creditors. The accusation is they were also trading insolvent, which would land you and I in jail or heavily fined. But not Mr Crisafulli.
109. Miles may well not be back. ALP rules cause a leadership spill after any election loss.
110. Cheers, I've also noticed people will blame us, but not ever mention the fact the ALP barely campaigns west of the great dividing range. In my electorate they campaigned in literally two of the towns. How do we expect regional voters to make the right choice when the ONLY campaigning we get to see is LNP and One Nation?
111. I honestly think the only reason, QLD has an LNP Gov today. Is those idiot voters who thought, ALP have been in Gov long enough. The most idiotic way to vote. The LNP will screw up the transition to renewables. Leaving QLD behind the rest of Australia. After the new year. There will be a conscience vote on abortion. Next step will be a coordinated media campaign. Then a members bill on abortion by mid next year. With a vote before the end of 2025.
112. Doesn’t matter where you are or your preferences: if you meet someone saying they think both sides are bad they’re 100% voting conservative.
113. The ALP definitely dropped the ball on rural recovery, and tourism, in the post COVID environment. But that's something to improve rather than baby with the bathwater responses unfortunately.
