Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. most pv cells are made of coated silicon, one of the most abundant elements around (second after oxygen i think). there is more glass used to protect the cells than used to create the panel itself, meaning when a panel is swapped out every 25-30 years, a majority of that glass stays right where it is. the biggest *real* issue with solar/wind is enough energy storage to shift off-peak production to peak demand, with chemical batteries being very very expensive right now and hydro batteries being reliant on geography. Either way, renewables require an initial investment the same way coal and gas did when they were first used to power the grid. Only this time, that investment lasts longer than coal ever could and you dont need to pay for the unnecessary labour required to burn a million+ tons of the stuff every year per plant.
2. Solar panels last 20-30 years; petrol lasts for the second it burns. Recycling the components at the end of their lifetimes is a huge focus for the renewable energy sector. The power from my solar panels doesn't need to get dug out of the ground, trucked around, and burned. It goes from my roof to my car. But we're not really going to pretend that you're against renewables because they aren't environmentally friendly *enough*, are we?
3. Such as?
4. Care to give an example?
5. Miles isn't really woke, though.
6. 'woke agenda' lmaoooooo what does that even mean in this context? please give actual examples of 'the left' and their 'woke agenda'
7. Ah now that you’ve listed what they were wearing there’s no way you’re lying. Thanks for confirming.
8. All these metaphors really bust me plugger
9. I can’t see how liberal make it worse labor actively opened the doors to hundreds of thousands and crushed our rental market
10. As far as I am concerned they do not give you citizenship unless you have a good job and are qualified. They only give you a visa where you have to find the job yourself. My parents are Indian and obtained Aussie citizenship by going back to school and getting jobs that are reputable and are actually facing a shortage in Australia i.e healthcare. And the people who did obtain some form of citizenship this way are illegal and should be deported. It must be some sort of forgery.
11. That's a petition for the Federal Senate...
12. Fair enough. Although whether the Brits are worse than us or not, it's still a problem here.
13. Agreed, I’m not pushing to promote what theyr doing, but I think the picture is far more complex now then assuming they only attract racist supporters. There’s a reason they continue to win more seats every election, but idk, maybe that’s just reactionary to those arguments about the left pushing too far (I’m sure u know the one, I don’t care to entertain it, I’m an openly gay man and pushing an agenda on kids is in no ally’s interest, and can only think it’s genuinely the influence of Russian bots spouting seeds of division).
14. The very environmentally friendly chemicals that are forever abundant? We’re going to have a problem with the toxic batteries that’ll make asbestos look like a baby in the near future. And also look into actually how much and who owns the key components of batteries. There isn’t enough friendly toxic chemicals to last a few decades - and the owners will be able to increase the prices dramatically
15. I don’t think you understand how much energy it takes to make glass. And the massive amounts of concrete and steel in a base of a wind turbine. They will never be recycled- ever. If you cared about using less energy, you’d realise that 70% of the energy is lost in transmission. Construction is less than 8% of energy usage. If you made the massive building landlords change the leasing rules to increase air conditioning temperatures by 1 degree in commercial buildings, you’d save way more than all renewable efforts. When people feel so strongly about things that have such little impact, you play with the fringe without tackling the bigger problem. Exactly what the coal companies want
16. The left is woke, pro union and a group of losers re foreign policy, immigration etc. - and I doubt people really care about whether an individual in red is the same or different (I don’t)
17. Jeans and a baseball jacket in that heat? Yeah sure hahaha
18. Your plugger wouldn’t be bust if you didn’t clench so hard.
19. Immigration didn’t crush the rental market, that is a scapegoat. The population would be within 10% with or without the immigration policies. What crushed the rental market is a lack of government housing to provide a floor for rent and negative gearing skewing the investment market. No developer is going to increase supply in a constrained market enough to lower their returns or waste realestate on providing lower cost housing when they could sell them at higher rates to investors
20. It isn't forgery, it is playing exactly by the written rules and wholesale ignoring the spirit. The rules say you have to pass an english test so they teach exactly to the test the same as in every other industry. The reputable places who fail their students go out of business because the dodgy ones have 100% pass rates so everyone goes to them.
21. Ah yeah, my bad - so it is.
22. I don’t think every One Nation supporter is a racist, but they have all decided to support a racist party with racist leaders, which I would argue makes them racist, even if they aren’t actively personally racist. But I do get what you’re saying. It’s all based on material conditions. And yes the bots too.
23. > look into actually how much and who owns the key components of batteries i don't really understand what you're getting at here, but chemical batteries are not the only form of battery storage, they just happen to be the easiest to implement directly into the grid. Li-ion/LiFePo4 batteries are also not the only chemical batteries out there, hydrogen fuel cell technology is already powering translink busses and electrolysis is the perfect thing for dumping a bunch of useless off-peak generation for later use. We have several very viable and proven technologies at our disposal here, we'd be stupid to waste something as free and limitless as the sun.
24. People do. Not everything revolves around you. Unions do a lot of good unless you're an abusive employer.
25. Define 'woke'
26. 'Plugger' is a slang term for thong or flip flop in Australia ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|smile)
27. Which is exactly why we should reduce immigration, so that people don't come to this country unqualified. Coming to a foreign country with dodgy results isn't illegal? For you to obtain a job, it requires a working level of English. Your argument about the people faking IELTS is correct, but they are mainly students who do it to study abroad. Not people with degrees who are educated. Most Indians who have obtain citizenship are educated and know the voting system mate and I can assure that they vote conservative on purpose. However, I can't speak for all immigrants
28. Unions were relevant in the early of child labour etc. Not anymore They do nothing other than maintaining the Australian national sport of mediocrity through unnecessary protections I understand why you find them important - there are almost 300 million Indonesians living next door who would be happy to do your job for $100 per day. That’s the value of your time and skills - if you make more than that through being protected by the unions then I understand that you’re truly grateful. … but you’re not competitive at the global level
29. Not the way I use it
30. I think you misunderstand. These businesses are in Australia working with people who already have visas and are working on permanent residence status or citizenship. In theory they are a good thing as they cater to people working on obtaining citizenship/permanent residence but in practice they are a rort just like all of the other outsourced government programs. Australia runs on immigrant labour and immigrant scapegoating. Without immigrants to do service and production work and to be the enemy in political discussions the true state of the economy would be exposed and collapse.
31. You're free to use your plugger anyway you like.
32. Thanks for the consent, now bend over
33. My friend voted LNP because their MP is actually well known in the region and has advocated multiple times in parliament based on letters and correspondence sent in by individuals and business in the electorate. Meanwhile the Labor candidate was just some random person without much of a track record of anything. Not hard to see which is a more convincing proposition I guess. In the 2022 Federal Election, someone in the community who was well known ran as a progressive independent and almost took the seat from the LNP so it’s not like the seat is staunchly pro-LNP.
34. Apparently a friend I spoke to last night voted LNP because he 'hates mining companies"...
35. I asked my 4 family members who all voted LNP and here are their reasons: 1. Youth Crime & Labour had been in too long 2. Has always voted LNP at every level because their parents have always done that 3. Just picked the one that looked the cutest/coolest 4. Didn't know anything about any of the parties (it was their first election)
36. “Steven miles had a smug face during Covid” Stupid hurts sometimes
37. Sister who works in government in HR hated dealing with union shit all the time. She also has 2 daughters....
38. A nurse i know voted lnp because it's Labors fault the interest rates went up. I tried to argue the point and that this is a state election but no joy. Looking forward to fighting hard for our next EB agreement and striking next year.
39. [Didn't think I was going to get another use out of this so soon.](https://giphy.com/embed/12ETcAyWE6TjHy)
40. Asked mum what she was hoping for from an LNP government. Answer; increased public housing build by state government and a freeze on council rates and insurance costs. So yeah, let’s just leave it there.
41. A lot of my family are rusted on lib supporters. Some just wanted something different. Few of them will see any benefit I’m sure, as my nan said “why vote conservative if you’ve got nothing to conserve”
42. How about the Olympics??? … surely there’s ALP voters who were absolutely embarrassed at the idea that we weren’t getting a legacy stadium build for lions/cricket but QSAC was getting a 1.4 million temporary renovation. We might still have a dud Olympics but least it won’t be at Mt Gravatt
43. I'm actually worried about my job, I'm on a contract and work for P.A Hospital... Apparently last time lnp got elected they got rid of a lot of Qld Gov workers in the hospital...
44. Dead ass the parents of a kid at my son's school voted LNP because: Labour are getting rid of bulk billing, they want to charge $250 for a doctor's appointment. Another voted for one nation because: She just says what we are all thinking.
45. ![gif](giphy|h7noFsLU9Ekj6)
46. So what exactly is the QLD LNP's plan ?
47. I have one cousin who apparently didn't like Steven Miles' 'vibe'. True story.
48. farmers
49. A friend voted LNP because he’s in the ADF, that is all
50. I didnt vote for them, but the new sex offender registery is a good idea. I think they're going to name it Daniel's law after Daniel Morcombe
51. -Apparently 50c train fares are misappropriation of funds and we should stop that. How dare the elderly and low income people (checks notes) go places. - something unintelligible about Ukraine inaudible muttering about Russia, mumble rumble, hezbollah needing to be shown what’s what and other incoherent babble. -Disney brainwashing children into being trans -the state school system being complicit in said transing of the youths -a woman should never have been made police commissioner for reasons -institutional misogyny doesn’t exist. Men and women are inherently different and just suited to different things. For example men are just better at being leaders and running countries and companies. Because statistically throughout history it’s been men and not women doing the leadership stuff. Check mate drop mic. -institutional racism doesn’t exist and anyone who is trying to say it does is just trying to blame me personally for colonisation -forced vaccinations and how everyone has compromised immune systems now that has nothing to do with contracting a virus that causes autoimmune disruption multiple times and everything to do with having to wear masks. (Actual conversations with conservative family members And no I don’t know how labor/greens etc are responsible for any of this stuff.)
52. Mining stonks go brrrrr
53. Might finally get that new primary school on the west side. Might get disabled abscess to Taringa station Might Address over crowding at state high schools Might get a public transport option on the centenary highway Might get cooperation between the BCC and the state government for once Might get a decent Olympic plan Might get none of that 🤷🏻‍♀️
54. One of my besties is staunch lnp volunteer, I helped ALP, we caught up a few days ago and we agreed a mixed or more balanced Parliament is in everyone's interests. But only if sh!t gets done. Incidentally, it was very civil at my local poll, the reds and blues chatted all day, locals who knew each other and were respectful. (Not a Green in sight, perhaps they moved to West End)
55. I don’t believe Crissafulli won. Labor lost. There’s a big difference sadly
56. I don’t know the reasons, but I do know that hard core labor voters have turned, my father is a lifetime union member, his father a member of the labor party, his grandmother one of the first female QLD union members and family history in the labour movement dating back to the Ballarat goldfields, and he voted Liberal.
57. LNP going into the campaign with no solid plan worked, since it let everyone's imagination run wild with the ideas of, "'x' will finally be fixed.".
58. So, from coworkers I got: Because, with the exception of the 3 year Newman government, Labor has been in power since 1998. Thus since 1998 they have had 23 years in power to organise and improve things or ignore and break things. Obviously, they did both as any political party would do. Because some people were still hurting over decision and decision making processes made during Covid, unable to see dying relatives, etc. Some were worried about issues around how Labor dealt with the corruption watchdog. Because some people were concerned about the amount of money being spent and borrowed against the future as part of the election campaign. That's a list I heard from people at work. In the end both parties have some pretty serious shortcomings and issues, however, and I understand people's passion, Reddit has been giving very loud Labor and Miles are Jesus/Gandhi equivalents and LNP and Crisafulli are Satan/Hitler - which beyond being simplistic and silly doesn't really get others talking and makes threads an echo chamber. FYI, that's an observation, not an invitation to start an argument.
59. Friend voted ALP, but still thinks the local LNP member will be good for the town. They have an active history working in the local area, and doing a lot for the community.
60. - If you like big holes in the ground, we'll be getting more of those - If you like car parks being available in the CBD, that'll happen - If you are a developer, cha-ching!
61. I worked in the Qld government for many years, and the stuff I saw over the last 7 or 8 years was pretty bad. There are a few ministers I worked under who cared more about getting themselves on the news rather than having stuff done properly. It is a shame for Steven Mike's as I do like him, and I hope he stays as leader.
62. has anyone given a genuine answer yet? Here are some good points: \- LNP raising the first home buyers grant from 700k-800k \- LNP to establish $2bil fund to help councils build infra for developers \- Clamp down on youth crime (as many have already mentioned \- Reducing surgery wait list for public hospitals \- Increase of ambos on the road \- a regulatory review into the building industry (much needed imo) \- $27mil towards free vision, hearing, speech checks for kids \- LNP promised to have a decision on the Olympic situation within 100 days Obviously both sides have some good points. but instead of everyone saying "we're doomed" and being negative i think an actual answer to the question is needed. The election happened. the LNP won. We need to deal with it and move on.
63. “I think Steven Miles is a twat.” “Why?” “Because the Courier-Mail said so.”
64. The LNP have committed to scrapping the current Stage 4 route which will in effect wipe out the township of Elimbah. I voted to save my town. https://preview.redd.it/kz483j9ww8xd1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a81ff61d3dc21672f3c5d82d155b95c3f6640b6c
65. Someone I know voted Bree James because they liked her Hitler joke 🤣🥲😅 this person is not my friend
66. 1. Olympics 2. Crime 3. Promised to match 50c fares - ALP’s policy but would have been a dealbreaker for me they were going to remove it. 4. Promise to fix Union corruption Edit: added 4
67. Friends - some come from big, Christian, traditional, business-owning and property-owning families. I don't think it gets any more "core voting base" than that. I think the LNP objectively benefits them, I can't blame them on that. Not to say they always vote Liberal, mind, but they generally will when the country does.
68. My local member failed our community,it was time for a change… it’s as simple as that
69. Probably one of the bright spots of the LNP is in the seat of Bonney, held by Sam O'Connor on the Gold Coast. From following his personal insta hes campaigned on keeping Jacks Law, (extra police power for on the spot checks for knives in late night precincts and train stations.) and funding for wildlife hospitals, I think the amount was $5 million. He was the shadow Environment and Science minister and if he keeps his role in the cabinet will be a young fresh face for the party. Although the environment will probably be completely destroyed under his role, I am hoping that it might not be as bad as Cambell Neumann. I used to live in his electorate but have since moved to Brisbane. Hes got genuine community support and does alot for his electorate, unlike the Fools seat just above his.
70. As a nurse, I’m interested to see what’s next. There is no mention of a pay increase to nurses or how they are going to help with daily occupational violence we experience. The truth is we are underpaid, over worked, physically and mentally abused, and have no real support. They keep saying they will deliver more nurses. But all the experienced nurses have left and are still leaving the industry in record numbers. A QNMU poll asking if you were thinking of leaving came back with 18,000+ responses saying they will leave by mid 2025. Nurses are more likely to be attacked on the job than corrections and police officers. We have no hazard pay and some administration officers are getting more money than bedside nurses. Yes, the nursing diploma is free in TAFE. But the registered nursing degree is $40,000+ for content that is way out of touch with industry. Education needs to come back to the hospital, bring that money back from universities into the public and private systems. Allow for paid placements without income stipulations. The current new grad from university are barely capable of safely caring for 1 patient when our ratio is 4. One of the LNP health plans is this: To identify where the pressure-points are and target funding to fix them: We will unlock transparent real-time hospital data within 100 days. We will provide Queenslanders with the truth about what’s happening in our hospitals, as it happens, not when it’s politically convenient. We will deliver accountability for wait times, the number of patients waiting at Emergency Departments and how many hospital beds are available. We will use real-time data to drive resources and frontline staff to where they are needed Every nurse needs to utilise the workload reporting form on their desktop or print out, depending on facility. As this real time data will become more valuable than ever with the LNP looking at what’s wrong. It will show our short staffing crisis and skill mix issues.
71. I was always told growing up to vote for LNP because they help people who want to work hard and make money , not people who just want hand outs
72. Bc their fking name was familiar. "I just voted for the names I knew" That's what we're living amongst.
73. It’s really weird to ask about people’s honest opinions here on reddit because the community is anything but accepting of different view points. Anyone who voted for parties progressive people of reddit don’t like are labeled “waste of space” and worse (just a beautiful little post in Queensland community). It’s very similar to how aggressive anti-Trump crowd is in America. They would literally scream at your toddler because you dare vote in ways they don’t approve. So the majority of people just vote quietly against people who repeatedly insult and berate them. Pretty understand position.
74. Most people don’t not have a clue on the policies of any party. They vote on who they like or dislike. Literally as we were sitting in front of the polling booth, my wife asked me who we’re voting for. I told her who I’m voting for and why. I told her the policies the two major parties were offering and she said “oh!” She literally did not have a clue. She would’ve voted LNP because that’s what her parents have always done. If everyday Australians just took an interest in what’s being offered then I don’t think the LNP would ever get in. Incidentally, the LNP are better for my line of work but ethically speaking I cannot bring myself to vote for them.
75. I voted independent. My entrenched ALP member certainly skirts the line between crook and politician, is a union crony and is constantly in the media at all levels for his 'shenanigans', failings and dodgy deals, and is probably lucky to have not been charged with multiple white collar offences. But he got back in again. If he was an LNP member and did the same things he had done over the last few terms, this sub would be calling for his head.
76. Here is my reasoning (not that it matters—I was in an ultra-safe Labor seat). As a teacher, I am burnt out. Our pay has been stagnant, matching only inflation for the past six years, yet we are being asked to work longer hours and take on more administrative duties. The government has removed any viable method of disciplining students, and it’s now seen as a black mark for principals to suspend students, so they don’t. Education is in crisis, and Labor has been in charge of it. None of the eight-page policy documents they’ve released address teachers’ concerns. The focus is solely on students and parents. The LNP’s document, on the other hand, focuses on helping teachers. Whether they can deliver on that or not remains to be seen, but I am willing to give them my vote and a chance to try. I already know Labor won’t do anything for me, except make me more burnt out. The LNP government might backfire, but for my personal circumstances it was the best vote for me.
77. Not me but my mum works with someone and they voted because of something to do with solar panels
78. People didn't vote for the LNP. They remember how the ALP state government behaved during the pandemic, and, well... A whole lot of other reasons no doubt.
79. Because they’d build a proper stadium for the Olympics
80. I dont align with a political party I HATE the fact people call themselves left or right, I think that’s complete gang mentality, cult like hive mind behaviour from both sides. I didn’t vote LNP, But my guess is the majority of people who are unhappy with what the government has done over the past 3 terms the ALP has been in power and they want things to change. they probably wouldn’t care what the LNP announced on the policy level, they just want change to the government that they are sick of not addressing their wants. Maybe if Steven miles had of taken over earlier from Anastasia and was able to make some more policy change or listened to the public in time they may still be in power? But I think it boils down to people being unhappy and wanting change and clearly the majority have lost faith in the ALP. I’m sure I’ll get downvoted to hell but I don’t care, you need to stop being hysterically politically aligned, change is okay, the country will still keep running no matter which party is in power. it’s a shame we all follow this left and right bullshit and there isn’t a party that actually cares about all people across the board. Left and right are both flawed.
81. https://i.redd.it/d8v6alg8x8xd1.gif
82. If I still lived in my hometown of Mackay I might have voted for Nigel Dalton, the LNP candidate. I know him personally and have a lot of respect for him and I know he's there to serve his community because he did even when I was a kid. Although I disagree with his party's policies, he *personally* would have probably got my vote. People can lose my vote by lacking integrity and honesty, even if they represent my preferred party; I think the opposite can be true as well.
