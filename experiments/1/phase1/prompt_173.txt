Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Taking pleasure from other people’s struggle is unworthy of anyone claiming to be Aussie. We’re all better than that. Or at least, we used to be. Where did we get this bloody American tribalism shit? I wish whatever un-Australian fk wits spreading this mentality would bugger off to Texas or Tennessee.
2. Some of us have been forced to struggle so hard we’ve been backed into a corner and struggle is turning to will to survive
3. RIP Greens Qld ✅ less fuckin windmills destroying our hillsides
4. They could do much worse and may well do. They have no plan. Housing and cost of living arent a Qld only problem.
5. You'll be on the copium when the LNP get replaced after a singular term again once they destroy the state, There is a reason why No one wants the Corruption party in power which all goes back to Joh Bjelke-Petersen, you should do some learning instead of blindly supporting those who only ruin the state.
6. There will be a change in 4 years alright once the LNP ratfuck everything.
7. Wow.
8. That’s how government works? The tax payers pay for stuff??? Enjoy your tax dollars going to mining and gas companies now.
9. Except Qld doesn't tax individuals. That's federal income tax. Qld taxes corporations, like Adani. So arguing lower taxes is helping foreign Mining companies.
10. Yeah can’t wait to take out my ambulance insurance cover from a fake market stacked with LNP shell companies.
11. That's a pretty strange example to bring up, given that QR National was sold off by a Labor government.
12. Look for a struggling insurance provider who has a family member who is sitting in an LNP seat.
13. QR was sold off by Campbell. Energx will so be in Campbell 2.0 sights. Can’t have a good thing in public hands.
14. Then they’ll privatise it…. It’s all part of the plan
15. Build more prisons, lock up all the criminals. This will benefit the housing crisis with ultra high density housing.
16. Will seeing how labor shills complained about the NT I don't think LNP shills will
17. Not if dutton gets in and spends trillions on nuclear...
18. I don’t disagree about Labor loving mining royalties, but your comment about magic money trees is incredibly stupid and arrogant. Plenty of avenues for revenue to look after people and their basic needs. There’s one thing that we can be confident on, LNP and their voters are all about themselves, oh and locking up kiddies.
19. what happens when we run out of coal, and our food supply chain is in ruins because of ocean salinity, and increased acidity of rain?
20. Now we just need some nuclear and fk off all these price gouging elec companies. We pay far to much for power especially all this bs renewables.
21. Wtf i am literally confused about wtf has happened tonight with the quality of candidate put forward and this makes the most sense I've read. I genuinely had a little more faith in humanity and in qld 10 hours ago The power of propaganda is alarming to see
22. That's exactly what happened.
23. Labor have been in power for the last 10 years in Victoria
24. Victoria or NSW? Because Victoria has had a labor government for over a decade and NSW had Labor for 13 years. Liberal hold Tasmania and now QLD so your comment is very ill informed and you should be embarrassed.
25. You think NSW is/was a less conservative state? Yeah, ok "Bruz"...
26. Most of the people who moved here from other states after COVID are boomers who are now trying to turn the state into their private retirement village. It's no surprise they vote Libs. Fuck you, I got mine attitude.
27. Bit of both. The free TAFE list is federal and relates to targeted professions. Free cert IIIs to school leavers is state.
28. I hope so.
29. They pledged to keep it for one term. Miles pledged to write it into legislation forever, since the coal royalties would have helped. Given Crisafulli has since backtracked on several pledges, including one yesterday before the voting booths opened, I would trust his word like a wet bill.
30. Yeah of course they said that. It’s a super popular thing that would absolutely cost them if they said they weren’t going to keep it. Doesn’t meant they will now that they have control. Especially when they get rid of all the mining tax and let the mining companies do whatever they feel like. Where will the money come from to fund it? They won’t make any effort to find another way to fund it and it’ll just naturally disappear.
31. The guy was literally implementing and doing the things he said he would, don’t be daft.
32. I was impressed at her mastery of cognitive dissonance while being interviewed last night.
33. I think 2 years, but yeah, he might get knifed after at his second sitting. You can tell he's scared. He looks like Dick Haper from Fun with Dick and Jane.
34. WTF are you on mate?
35. Except that they absolutely could. Crisafulli himself voted against decriminalisation, and multiple of his MPs have openly stated that they would recriminalise it if given the chance - which they will be, since Katter has already vowed to table it after the election.
36. I agree it is highly unlikely, but assuming they do advance a Katter-based conscience vote, there is no guarantee the exceptions will be the same as last time. Appealing to the relatively broad access that existed pre-legalisation (it was effectively legal under that regime tbh) doesn't mean anything here as they haven't said what the wording will be.
37. Australians on Reddit import too much American rhetoric
38. Oooo you're clever.
39. No that'd be ridiculous, imagine different police force for each local municipality... like the seppos... Fuck that noise. It'd cost a fortune with new local taxes being introduced to fund the seperate entities. All the letterheads, all the procedures and protocols need to be written up and made law... more money from the tax base. To make it work and to operate as a functioning country it'd be federal laws governing all with minor local matters being dealt with by councils... Yuck no. I agree we waste too much money on too much government but would you live in the alternative?
40. When did any of them actually suffer or put themselves at risk for the community or people they are supposed to serve?
41. Coal mines do so much less damage. /s
42. Dog ate my homework.
43. Let me be clear for those in the back of the r/queensland sub, YOU ARE THE MINORITY!
44. The change will be backwards, last time LNP touched the top job it was a shit show
45. Yes, I am shocked people are still murdering babies. How barbaric have we become in the name of progressiveness
46. Thank you. Let’s ignore the $17B in GST from the federal government, stamp duty, payroll tax. Money which needs to be managed wisely. A
47. Haven’t heard of this conspiracy/notion. Link me up and I’ll have a read. I just wanted to point out that “the other side” privatised too.
48. That’s the whole point. I think you read the OP post wrong lol?? Or is your reply to the OP and not me?
49. To be fair 66% of qr national was sold by Labor, Campbell sold the remaining stake
50. True qld motorways abbot point port qr national port of brisbane forestry plantations cairns & mackay airports brisbane airport wind energy assets gas assets & enertrade golden casket power direct sun gas sun retail allgas
51. QR national/Aurizon was absolutely not sold off by Campbell, it happened while Bligh was premier lol
52. Then those kids will be hardened criminals in 4 years and LNP can start their marketing all over again in 8 and blame ALP
53. "We need more skilled immigration to work at the prison"
54. Nah, they won’t spend any money on it. Just delay tactic to keep coal going for a bit longer
55. One can only hope
56. Not sure my comment is stupid but if QLD can find a spare $100 billion to cover mining exports I’m all for it (note over 50% is coal exports). I would say your comment is naive. We are all benefiting from mining booming and I’d argue there are no free lunches and the reason we are talking about free lunches, cheap fares, increased wages for teachers/nurses etc is because mining is booming. Happy to argue where the money is going but your initial comment suggests that the mining sector booming is bad. I disagree.
57. We will never run out of coal, not for 1000+ years… Anyone that says we will run out of coal in our lifetime or our great grandchildren’s lifetime, obviously has never worked in a coal mine & never seen the Bowen Basin… As for climate change scares, the science that we make an impact is real, but do we make enough of an impact to create an immediate catastrophe? No. So let’s stop the hysteria and avoid sending us all broke over a shock transition to no emissions. Do it gradually & strategically…
58. Nuclear will be more expensive though… so there’s that. One can only hope we get more renewables to continue bringing down the cost of power in QLD. Renewables being the cheapest electricity we have, which is peak during the day.
59. Victoria or NSW? Because Victoria has had a labor government for over a decade and NSW has had Labor for 13 years. Liberal only hold Tasmania and now QLD so your comment is very ill informed and you should be embarrassed.
60. Palace shook clung on for a bit too long. Before the Olympics announcement was the time to gracefully step away. "Not Labor" got them over the line.
61. I was specifically talking about the influx of imports from NSW...
62. And it’s broke now.
63. Ahhh, you mean NSW had Liberal for 13 years... Like from 2011 to 2023. During the pandemic, the leader was Gladys Berejiklian who was absolutely not Labor, and **NSW folk were lining up at the QLD border to cross**. 🤦🏻‍♀️ You call my comment ill informed and then you write **whatever that is**. Typical right winger, misinterprets something, comes in swinging for no reason, embarrasses themselves. Why on earth did you even decide to come into a discussion with your aggression anyway? Any danger of right wingers not being angry?
64. Bruz is from the regions. He's a corrupt fuckwit but still less conservative than KAP and we as a State gave them 3 seats. In Queensland, One Nation/KAP/Family First have about 12% of first preference vote. In NSW, similar conservative parties get about 5%. Queensland is and always has been more conservative than NSW and Vic
65. The majority of inbound interstate migrants are aged 25-34, followed by those age 35-44. We also lose a lot of people aged 25-34 who migrate interstate, so the largest net gain is people aged 35-34. But if we’re talking purely about numbers coming in (who would then be voting) it’s that 25-34 age group. https://profile.id.com.au/comseq/migration-by-age No one has any evidence that the swing to LNP is caused by interstate migration. A lot of the swing is in areas minimally impacted by interstate migration eg up north in places like Townsville.
66. Yeah it was part of Albanese's first budget because the libs had privatised and gutted tafe nationally
67. Meh, wait and see. Out of my control. I’ll keep living my life.
68. That’s much more dignified than what we said. She was Probably the girl at school who was teachers pet and dobbed on everyone.
69. I have noticed that.
70. Expand the federal police force with the previous state police. Municipal police forces are generally a orruot nighmare. Laws could be nationised as is happening with this countries WH&S regs. Yes huge set up cost but cost saving long term. I worked in local government for many years and the state and federal bickering was exhausting when it came to funding/finance and compliance.
71. Let me be clear, You are the minority who think liberals can do a good job. They only got voted in because the whole "labor has been in too long" message if that didn't occur Liberals wouldn't of won as we know that they are simply corrupt and provide nothing of value to the country and states.
72. And you know what, majority of Queensland AGREES with this statement Shocked pikachu face 😱 Leftists in shambles
73. Except based on previous record, the other mob has given up being the "fiscally responsible" party because their policies made life harder for the average person while benefiting foreign interests.
74. Ah yeah, misunderstood you there whoops.
75. And more to come! So good taxpayers shouldn’t hold public assests when there’s profits to be made by the 1% then negative gear a bunch of investment properties to off set all those tax dollars.
76. I love that you get down voted when you actually prove your point lol
77. You’re still talking about their plan… :/
78. Can’t wait to see it fail hard, and they blame it on ALP haha
79. Yeah na. I’ll invest my time on good things for the betterment, rather than arguing with a rusted on ‘mining is good for us’ diatribe. Same argument as gambling is good for sport. It is bent. See ya.
80. my comment wasn't explicit about time frames. We will run out. Catastrophic effects of anthropomorphic climate change will happen. Natural climate change too. The other factor is that we will only make money on coal for as long as the world demands it. Taking a cursory look at the energy transition of the rest of the world makes black coals outlook short-sighted.
81. Have you not seen the charge coming forward for solar on roofs now due to excess solar going to the grid? Yet we are still being fucked by elec companies and being paid so little per kw/h we put back into the grid? Renewables aren't the only answer.
82. The current NSW premier is Chris Minns, the leader of the New South Wales Labor Party, who assumed office on 28 March 2023. Minns defeated Dominic Perrottet at the election held on 25 March 2023, after twelve years of Liberal/National Coalition rule.
83. Ha. I admit I stuffed up, cut and paste and didn’t paste in the 2nd half correctly. *Had liberal for 13 years before last year. I’m not right winger, I don’t have any affiliation and I vote with whoever’s policy I agree with. There was no aggression, I completely disagree with your comment that people left a failed liberal state and moved here to vote LNP. Of the 120k people migrating to qld every year how many do you suppose moved to the regional areas that had most swing? Victorians had the highest migration of any state from their failed labor state.
84. Stop using logic mate. He just told you that you are wrong emphatically. That is all that is required these days on reddit. How anyone who has watched any political commentary or has any knowledge of political history in this country would think that QLD is less conservative that NSW is dumbfounding. Just don’t engage.
85. Okay. So we get to keep one thing.
86. I’m not happy about it since I take the tram to work. It’ll increase my expenditure again and as a student living on their own, any savings is good.
87. That’s not why they were voted in. Labor is has been in for ages, and where are we for it? Housing is insane, cost of living is insane, youth crime is rampant (don’t say it’s not, I see it). People obviously want change. And because reddit is a massive echo chamber for the left, rather than look at Labor’s failings, they just scream and shout about “how could this have happened, we are all doomed”. If labor did a better job, they’d still be in.
88. "Labor has been in too long" was all it took to sway former Labor voters loooool
89. Another issue is the size of the public service in QLD. This becomes the “average person” because they employ so many people. There is no effort to make the state business friendly - which is why QLD doesn’t host any head offices. All business of size moved to VIC and NSW.
90. No worries. Mate it’s unreal how far left people are on this forum. Legit hard to get people to stick to facts and not fairytales their dads told them. Crazy times.
91. Is that not how it'll play out?
92. Nuclear is proven technology, why would it fail?
93. Good on you. More than happy for people to present alternate viable views. Not sure you really have. I was trying to have a discussion. Mining is bad and I’ll argue for something better… without any claim of what a better option. I’d love for us to diversify our economy. But your suggestion the ALP is good and LNP is bad just doesn’t cut it with me. And please my views were hardly a “diatribe”. Unless you genuinely feel I’m being aggressive and forceful with my views.
94. Lmao!!!!! The world is over populated!!!! The polar bears are going extinct!!!! Greta told me it would happen!!!! Fuck off doomer
95. They aren’t, but right now they are the best and cheapest we have. I for one would prefer cheaper electricity for the next 10-20 years, then we can decide what is out there and if solid state power storage is better by then, and integrate into the grid. Rather than have to fix coal to last us 10-29 years for a nuclear power station to be built and start running, and then pay more than 4 times the cost of electricity compared to current renewables. What we do know is that renewables have become cheaper over time, renewable electricity has become cheaper over time, nuclear is up to 4-8times the cost per kw/h so electricity bills will be much more expensive.
96. Yeah was gonna say NSW has been liberal a long fkin time
97. So, how could you vote for the LNP then? Not only did they wait until the last minute to release their policies and costings but it was an absolute weak and thin joke with holes everywhere. Anyone pre-polling and voting for the LNP did so without a scrap of knowledge on what "their plan" was. I specifically spoke about the COVID migration QLD received from NSW because frankly, we had it **much better** up here than NSW. My comment was not remotely purporting to be fact, I was also curious like the original commenter I replied to. That was obvious. And calling Victoria a failed Labor state is laughable at best. They hated Dan so much, they voted him back in for goodness sake. They were looked after while NSW was on tanking incredibly. On the note of the timeframe I was originally referring to: The Labor premieres along with Sally McManus were the ones who forced the federal Libs into paying JobKeeper... Except the Liberals then went and fucked it up by paying directly to employers instead of individuals (as per the original submission). Morrison's brilliant idea was to let people plunder their super. Let's not forget Robodebt, a highly illegal scheme (that was known to be illegal) that killed our fellow Australians and forced many into hardship and poverty... The Liberals across the country, state or federal, have terrible form in countless areas. And they are factually utterly terrible managers of the economy, which seems to escape those who don't want to do literally even just some cursory research. >There was no aggression Uh, ok. That's not how your aggressive comments about me apparently being ill informed and uneducated came across.
98. Well known advocate for progressive policy and lifestyle, Joh Bjelke-Petersen
99. "*Labor is has been in for ages, and where are we for it? Housing is insane, cost of living is insane, youth crime is rampant (don’t say it’s not, I see it)*." By the data Youth crime is lowering, Thats alright if your opinion goes against it as thats just your opinion, I'll rely on the data. Cost of living was being addressed through various measures like rebates and 50c public transport that will be scrapped under the incompetent LNP.
100. I’m not disagreeing with you, just saying it’s their plan. By my accounts, were in violent agreement that it’s all shithouse
101. it's a lot of information, but the topic is well established: https://adepteconomics.com.au/does-nuclear-energy-have-a-future-in-australia/ https://ieefa.org/resources/nuclear-australia-would-increase-household-power-bills https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/is-nuclear-energy-feasible-in-australia-and-how-much-would-it-cost-20231004-p5e9qc.html https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-20/nuclear-costings-absent-power-bill-rise-supply-shortfall/104374718 https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-06-11/nuclear-power-for-australia-cost-and-timelines-explained/103641602
102. low quality bait, bad bot
103. It’s not an opinion, it’s an experience. I’ve had to chase 2 lots of kids away from breaking into my home in the last 2 years. Never once before that. My community page has CC tv of kids trying to break into houses, weekly. Cost of living measures, you mean the ones they recently put in just before an election? Just so they could try and win votes? Why not do that 2 years ago? And why not try to fix the actual causes of the cost of living, over little bandaid fixes? Labor has been in for a long time, and we are in a shit spot. That’s why LNP is in.
104. In SEQ You are part of the problem. If you are a reflection of the average thinker the Labor party has, unable to look at regional data and understand that crime trending down *statewide* does not mean that it is trending down *everywhere across the state*, then you are going to be in opposition a long time. But please, keep on denying reality. We have come to expect nothing less from Labor over the past 35 years.
105. Haha the face at the end was making me question
106. Why is cost an issue? I wouldn't put a price on having reliable clean power. Focusing on it from an economic perspective doesn't make much sense when the goal is to have reliable, clean energy. The only thing stopping us from having nuclear power is a lack of political will. The same thing that has held us back for the last 50 years. With the materials needed to produce batteries becoming a possible strategic resource, long term planning should include nuclear as a part of securing base load generation. Phasing out coal and moving only to battery storage for renewables may be cheaper and faster, but it is not a long term solution.
107. "I*t’s not an opinion, it’s an experience*." As I said thanks for your opinion. "*Cost of living measures, you mean the ones they recently put in just before an election? Just so they could try and win votes? Why not do that 2 years ago?*" No I mean the ones that have been around for the last 18 months. "*And why not try to fix the actual causes of the cost of living, over little bandaid fixes?*" LNP aren't going to fix anything, they will make it worse and I can't wait for you to eat your words over it but then again being an LNP shill you won't. "*Labor has been in for a long time, and we are in a shit spot.*" Yet we are in a great spot, Well we were under these LNP clowns got voted in. If we want to compare to a shit spot lets look back to the Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen era where Queensland was at its lowest and the reason why Labor has been in the last 30 years out of 35 years since with his near Dictatorship over QLD, Using QPS and other gov agencies to silence critics and Track/spy on opposition politicians for twenty years. [Watch this video for more context surrounding it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG_w-b_V1qQ)
108. "*In SEQ You are part of the problem.*" Across the board unfortunately, I know that doesn't play well with misinformation/lack of facts you have. "*But please, keep on denying reality. We have come to expect nothing less from Labor over the past 35 years.*" It seems you are the only person here denying the facts and data.
109. But in 10-15 years when the nuclear power is up and running, and cost 10s of billions of dollars, who’s to say that solid state batteries aren’t easily made and readily available? It just seems stupid to jump on nuclear today, betting that in 20 years we would have nothing else? Why not just invest more in cheap renewables now, reap the benefits and cheaper electricity, then make a call in 10-20 years? I for one would prefer cheaper electricity. Not sure about others in Australia.
110. I don't disagree with nuclear overall - I think it has been proven, and aside from a few notable events of extreme circumstances (natural disaster, and 2 counts of extreme human negligence) it is viable. Economy at a certain point must be a factor in a society, and world, built on monetary value and the impact it has on the society. I wish we lived in the world where economics aligned with our absolute needs, it sadly isn't the case. Example is the UAE, an Autocracy, still took 15 years to get one plant operational. Democracy is a much larger hurdle to jump over
111. Because future generations will have to pay it off. Why put an extra burden on the next few generations. It's very narrow minded way to think.
112. Qld police data shows crime rates trending up in the regions. You are outright lying, and still think you are in the right. Absolutely delusional. *People like you are why Labor lost* The lack of acceptance and accountability from you Labor folk is staggering. It is honestly hard to reconcile in my own mind how out of touch you lot are. I assumed it was rhetoric leading up to the election, but it's becoming clear you actually don't see anything wrong with your behaviours. Fascinating
