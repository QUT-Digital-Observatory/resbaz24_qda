Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. A good leader would want to know what the options are. Not just pick a random idea out of their head. That’s not what good leaders do.
2. Look Marge, its a negative karma famer .... in the wild
3. How is your QAnon membership working out.
4. [deleted]
5. That is what they are promising, to rebuild the public service expertise. Whether or not we believe them is another thing.
6. It’s just Disasterdeck or Ziggler, let’s be real.
7. haha the irony! using a consultancy for advice about cutting the use of consultant's!
8. They won’t hire anyone extra
9. They have said they will, but I am guessing you don't believe them. Frankly I don't either.
10. Yup
11. So the courier mail admits that the costings don't include any detail about how they're paying for their promises and then goes on to declare that "Labor’s claim the LNP plans to cut 17,000 public servants is rubbish". We still have no idea where that extra money is coming from. Where are the costings Dave? The only things that are costed are the things you copied from Labor. Plagiarism is not a joke, Dave. Do you own work for a change.
12. >MILES: Just released, the LNP's plan for cuts means frontline doctors, nurses, teachers will be sacked. >The LNP have finally released their costings and it's even worse than we feared. They've committed to $6.8 Billion in cuts. That means Queensland jobs will be lost. >... >This is Campbell Newman 2.0. >Before that election, Campbell Newman committed to $4 Billion in "savings" and then he sacked 14,000 Queenslanders. Now, David Crisafulli's cuts will mean 17,000 jobs will be lost. Crisafulli and the LNP's election campaign has been insulting to the public. No policy details. No costing details. No answer on an LNP conscience vote to criminalise Abortion in QLD.
13. Didn’t Campbell Newman promise that and then cut public services. Exactly like Tony Abbott too.
14. The bodies are still warm from last time.
15. Can’t cut public services if there is not public services… I’d put money that’s legit what the fks think
16. No public healthcare means The Poors will be even more desperate and exploitable. Win/win for the LNP.
17. If you vote LNP you are the problem
18. It should be illegal to wait until two bloody days before the election to drop information like this. Utterly disgusting rug-pull, but I expect nothing less from the LNP.
19. The link https://archive.is/xg6vi
20. I get the feeling they are trying to tighten up the ship but have never been below decks
21. Did you even read the article? ‘The costings did prove, as predicted, Labor’s claim the LNP plans to cut 17,000 public servants is rubbish – though it’s unlikely to stop a desperate party from howling about it’
22. Labor in Victoria said this Now Hospitals have had budget cuts , ambulance ramped and staff shortages
23. Politics is cringe and voting is gay
24. Labor didnt care about Nurses or Drs during the scamdemic yet apparently concerns are now that LNP will cut staff, Athough both are two wings of the same bird real change comes for voting for independents "Ms Fentiman said during the pandemic 1,100 staff were stood down, and another 1,000 resigned over the mandate. "We have global workforce shortages, so I think it makes sense now to reconsider this mandate," she said. "If someone wants to now reapply for a job with Queensland Health who is not vaccinated for COVID, there'll be treated the same as any other worker."
25. [removed]
26. have you lot seen the last debate at all why would lnp cut when we need more nurses on the floor smiling miles is driving up debt by spending money we don't have on satellite hospitals instead of hiring nurses. C-19 lockdowns we seen labor sack over half of the nurses because they didn't want to jab up same thing happened with the police force almost half got sacked cause they didn't want to jab up. the only cut lnp will do is in the public servant sector
27. The "Labor’s claim the LNP plans to cut 17,000 public servants is rubbish - though it’s unlikely to stop a desperate party from howling about it" line is jarringly out of place with the tone of the rest of the article; makes me wonder if it was forcedly included.
28. Yet there are so many people that have either already voted for them, or are still going to. Boggles the mind.
29. Yep, he's a turbo-Newman.
30. He did. He cut over 14,000 jobs. Then Newman & Crisafulli ran their 2nd term campaign on privatisation, fortunately they were given the boot and unable to follow through on the threat. It looks like Crisafulli is ready to give it another go. 😳
31. If there’s no figures, then theres still no counter to the claim isn’t there. $6 billion cut in contractors and consultants, but contractors include not for profit organisations like UQ healthcare who are essentially the only source of free comprehensive diabetes treatment in SEQLD Coatings didn’t prove shit because the costings aren’t there, no figure on public servant wages for example released.
32. Apparently I read more than the cherry picked line you did. "the costings" didn't prove anything because there were no costings. The absence of information doesn't prove anything. There's still a big black hole in their "costings" with no explanation on how they'll cover it. So yes, considering the LNP's lack of detail and fervour for privatisation, it's fair to assume that they'll be tearing into our public services go pay for it - that is, until they can provide the detail to confirm otherwise.
33. Victoria is broke because scommo outsourced quarantine to states, hotels and security guards. Queensland isn't broke.
34. Geez. I hope you don't use roads, or electricity or the internet or anything.....
35. > "Ms Fentiman said during the pandemic 1,100 staff were stood down, and another 1,000 resigned over the mandate. > So, the trash took itself out? This is no different to, say, a mechanic refusing to get qualified to work on cars less than 30 years old, and then getting fired. Yes, it affects their body since they have to "learn" something, and possibly reach further out and strain a shoulder. As a professional ANYTHING in the workforce, there are things that you have to do in order to keep your job. As a health practitioner, I think the expectation of "don't encourage spreading a deadly virus" is a pretty low bar.
36. Ok bot. Time for bed. Off you go. Sweet dreams.
37. Most intelligent LNP voter
38. Doctors, nurses, police, teachers and fire fighters are all public servants! Smh.
39. Source: trust me bro
40. Yes, Labor sacked "over half" the practicing nurses in QLD because "over half" of the registered medical professionals in the state didn't want to take a vaccine. You are definitely a smart man and not an utter loon.
41. Nurses and police are public servants.
42. Yeah crazy that health practitioners would lose their jobs for not getting a vaccine for a disease that was fucking people up. You gonna get mad that firefighters are forced to wear rebreathers next too?
43. Budget surplus Miles driving up debt How fucken thick are you idiots
44. Definitely. It's out of place and makes no sense considering that no costings were announced to prove or disprove anything.
45. It's interesting. You read that as external contractors. I read it as internal contractors. Ie. Contractors filling seats that used to be full time employees until they were cut by Newman. If they shed those internal contractors and replace them with fill time employees again, I completely support this pledge.
46. What makes you think they are targeting UQ healthcare? There’s a ton of dead weight in the public sector but that doesn’t just include Queensland health. There’s a ton of Government departments.
47. So like every single Government costing ever
48. I see you put your opinion in there Where did I say anything about Victoria being broke I Clearly was directed at the Fact of Labor’s lies And Victoria’s debt isn’t large and growing because of hotel quarantine - you muppet , if that was the case Queensland would be the same It’s due to the large spending in infrastructure projects You obviously have no idea Least in Victoria we have stuff to show for our dollars unlike QLD
49. Ah yes, roads and electricity fully justify the government overstepping my boundaries then taking and wasting my fucking money. Surely electricity justifies having corrupt pedophiles make the laws and forcing you to choose between themselves to make you feel as if you had a choice. ☝️🤓 Edit: typo
50. Wait what, you still think it stops transmission, sheesh and you trust the science
51. Oh I thought we were just making up any old shit. That seems to be modus operandi in r/queensland.
52. LNP wouldn't do that, they would prefer to outsource it all to Sarina Russo and such. That way, it reads "there is now fewer public servants", even though QLD pays more to get shit done - because then external contracting agencies (who overwhelmingly support LNP) increase their profit margins.
53. So how do they cut the dead weight without breaking their promise not to cut any public servants? Weird
54. Because the last time they promised similar, it included paramedics. It included the kind of not-frontline staff that make sure we don't fuck up admin the way we keep doing. It included the people who tell stories to children in libraries. It included the people who do outreach. It put us so far behind on public health we are barely able to tread water now. Because the ones they cut last time still blew out budgets but as consultants now. Claiming to target those is just trying real hard to complete the beheading.
55. Mostly because I know folk who use UQ Healthcare for diabetes treatment and know the staff of one of the clinics due to this and so I’m naturally going to be concerned about about any threat to their continued treatment. There was a lot of concern already about their contract being renewed this year, what happens in two years time for next renewal with a government aiming to reduce contractors? Also if your response is “ there’s a ton of dead weight in the public sector” then obviously you support cuts anyway so don’t be surprised when I consider your stance biased against those employed in the public service
56. It's a vast and easy target. But don't think others don't suffer.
57. No, literally just the LNP's this time.
58. Victoria has a rusty ferris wheen it can't afford to run and massive Covid debts. Queensland has mining money.
59. No to both, I'm just not a dumbass. By the way, don't bother voting, the deep state are forcing you to.
60. Looks like we're taking projecting out of the old US politics playbook too.
61. Who said they’re cutting dead weight ? I said there’s dead weight not the LNP
62. Sounds like catastrophising to me. If we have learnt anything over the last 9 years of Labor is healthcare and housing are top priorities to fix. Theres absolutely 0 substance to your panic.
63. And Labor
64. You have no idea - The Ferris wheel is privately owned Again what’s your point Shoes I am specking to a dumb muppet
65. Ok so how are they balancing the budget
66. Labor's costing have been out for 2 weeks now. They're complete. The LNP have refused to release theirs.
67. 30,000 Victorians move to Queensland every week because the state is a disaster. The brain drain has is making things worse. Drowned in covid and CFMEU construction rort debts , Victoria can't even afford clean its steets and parks any more. Victoria is screwed. Victorian Governments only plans now are to to try and keep the lights on. Victoria is like one big dead US city like Detroit or Baltimore. A failed state with no hope.
68. Can you link me please?
69. Source for your quote Seems like a lot of Skynewe bullshit though Considering Victoria Government don’t manage local parks and streets this is done by Councils - that comment is very bringing the muppet out in you And actually EPA budget for national parks is profitable due to landfill levy’s
70. I'm sure you can google it. You're clearly not interested. You couldn't even read this article let alone the costings.
71. [QLD Labor costings](https://www.stevenmiles2024.com/_files/ugd/c6d343_12b4ae57c3bc4185b076047397fa0f0b.pdf) available on their website. Gets updated every few days, this one is from today. It's a dry read.
72. I don't know why people will decide to waste their time reading my comment when clearly i have nothing to say. And yet you are still reading it.
73. I’ve tried and it won’t bring anything up which is why I’m asking for a link. I’ve seen details that they want to spend 4.7 billion over budget but no actual breakdowns.
74. It's all on the QLD Gov website if you're interested https://budget.qld.gov.au/budget-papers/#budget-overview
75. I had gone through the application process earlier this year (and failed the panel interview) and was starting the process again. But have since decided to no longer pursue this option for now. I’ve bailed out because I don’t think I could handle the gruesome scenes. There’s also a question during the interviews about whether you’re comfortable firing a gun. At the time I said yes, and then at the QPS open day they did a demo where they fired a gun (with blanks) at someone who was approaching them with a knife. My heart was racing while the guy next to me said to his partner “that was pretty cool”. Either that guy is built differently or is blissfully unaware and will be dealing with some trauma in the future. You have to do 3 years of general officer duties before you can go into specialised roles (detective) and you need to consider whether you will be able to mentally handle the things you will encounter along the way. I suggest going to an open day if you can. The QPS also hold regular information seminars.
76. You've got a couple of responses so far that appear to have come from individuals with no real knowledge of QPS. Disregard those. The answer is yes, if you wanted to pursue an investigative career there would be no barrier to that. You would need to do a few years general duties first. Just don't think of moving into a plain clothes role as a promotion or progression. Despite what many detectives will tell you, investigations (CIB or CPIU) is just one possible specialist path you could take. QPS is a big organisation with lots of career options. The problem is that day to day, as a junior constable, you'll be doing a shit job attending to DVs and drunks. The pressure is pretty high if you aren't suited to that sort of environment.
77. If you have experience as a lawyer in criminal law have you also thought of the Federal Police or Criminal Intelligence Comission? Generally those sorts of agencies would have a stronger focus on more complex crimes and investigations.
78. I’m a third year connie who has just won a spot in CIB. It is entirely realistic to expect to progress into plain clothes/detective work after a year or two, if you’re good and either lucky or willing to move for a spot. Getting to that point can be a slog though. You’ll spend your first year investigating shop steals and DV breaches at best. If you prove yourself competent then you’ll spend your second and third years busting your ass building a resume for a CIB/CPIU spot. I honestly can’t recommend this job to you unless being a detective is a life goal or something similar because it’s a slog getting there and it doesn’t let up once you make it. You’re gonna spend at least a few years getting to an investigative role and In the mean time being a uniformed police officer is generally an unreasonably difficult and thankless job. You’ll do multiple DVs a day every day, and no matter what you you’ll be wrong. You’ll work unreasonable hours and every second shift you’ll probably do overtime. You’ll likely get assaulted. You will have no social life, if you have a family you sometimes won’t see them for days. Somewhere around the 100th DV in as many days you’ll question why you’re doing this. You’ll ask that question again when you’ve just done your 30th hour of overtime this fortnight and again when you’re out at 3am hunting for pinches and some lazy ass sergeant sends you burn email about some pointless shit. If being a detective isn’t something you really really want, you’ll go back to being lawyer. So if you join you’ve got to really want it. As an aside bullying or disrespecting colleagues, female or otherwise, isn’t an issue at my station, but not every station is as good and I can’t speak for them.
79. Dont
80. Male dominated, bullying and harassment is not addressed and higher ups will be protected. As a female in LE it’s not all it’s cracked up to be, the mindset is still well in the 1970’s. With time it will change but the salary and hours do not equate to a decent standard of living. You will also witness the worst of society and that will come in all different shapes and sizes. I do know where you are coming from, there is a strong calling to front line services but it’s not what you think. For your mental health think really hard about it.
81. If you're interested in investigative work and decide the QPS isn't for you, there are other government organisations/statutory authorities that employ investigators. For example, a law degree is a great qualifcation to work for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the ACCC.
82. AFP might be more your thing
83. Major sexual harrassment in the QPS according to a lot of reports
84. I know someone who did exactly this. She left a few years later. Not a good place to work.
85. How fast do you run the hundred?
86. Id imagine you'd have to be able to cope with terrible sad situations ....i know i could not deal with seeing all the bad heartbreaking stuff ,and many policemen are stressed by it!,Police also get abused by the low life people and they have to just take that abuse! We need police or there would be anarchy on the streets! I respect the police as they do a great hard job!
87. if you can help women fleeing terrible situations then go for it, femicide is out of control
88. Majority of new cops work is dv calls and drinks/drugs. You will see death. You will see destruction. It will take its toll mentally on you. Give it a good hard think if you really want all that.
89. Pretty sure you get to skip a fair bit of the pre training stuff with a degree especially in law. There would be a few pathways for you. Once you get through probation I think the only limit is your posting. Worth having a chat with the academy.
90. You could be a cop who moonlights as a lawyer. Smart move. There's a lot of scum out there on the streets who all deserve a fair and costly trial. Go well <3
91. Very good points thank you, I will look into going to an open day!
92. I appreciate your response, I suppose I have absolutely no idea if I could handle that environment until I am in it?
93. So do the police call DV call outs shit jobs?
94. Valuable information thank you!
95. Hey mate, I'm going to the academy in January, would you mind if I pm you a couple of questions?
96. What can you reasonably expect to earn after the three years general duties? What are the hours/rosters actually like? Thanks for your response!
97. First year constable gets the same salary on average as a first year lawyer… They get paid very well these days.
98. You would not get to skip anything.
99. How are you with death, drug overdoses, suicide? Some big ones people don't consider, yes there is drunks, domestic violence, brawls, stabbings but one of the FIRST things one of my relatives went to was a traffic stop where someone got hit on the side of the road while they were changing a tire or something of that nature. There's also overdoses, suicide, trafficking. I don't say any of this to scare you, but I've been around paramedics & a few NSW police and it's just a really mentally tough gig.
100. They are shit jobs in the sense that no one enjoys them. They are always unpleasant, often complex, and there is a great deal of paperwork as a result.
101. Sure, ask away. I’ll answer anything I can.
102. This bullshit needs to stop. No donations and capped campaign spending per candidate. All lobbying made public and if you break the rules there's major penalties. Can't be that hard surely.
103. Every single cent donated to a political party should be publicly viewable online & any company that is involved in a tender process should be prevented from donating during & up to 2 years afterwards.
104. >**Hayden Johnson** >October 24, 2024 >A cyber security company awarded a $15m government contract paid $2500 to attend a Labor Party fundraising dinner with minister Mick de Brenni on the night tenders for the contract closed. >While there is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Mr de Brenni or the company, the incident has prompted transparency experts to demand an overdue tightening of Queensland’s cash-for-access laws by whichever party forms government after Saturday’s election. >Membership of Labor’s business roundtable program, linking executives with ministers, costs $10,000 each year while the LNP’s similar program, Solutions Queensland, costs $25,000. >On September 30, just hours before the government entered caretaker mode, Cryptoloc Technology was named by Small Business Minister Lance McCallum as the successful tenderer to roll out a $15m government program to boost cybersecurity protections for small and medium-sized businesses. >On July 23, the day tenders for the contract closed, the company paid $2500 to attend a dinner with Mr de Brenni as part of the Queensland Labor Business Roundtable cash-for-access program. >Despite the company being in the running for a lucrative government contract, detail of its attendance at the dinner – along with some 20 other businesses – was not disclosed in Mr de Brenni’s diary because it was a political party event. >“Minister de Brenni was a guest speaker at the Queensland Labor Business Roundtable,” spokesperson for the minister said.Cryptoloc Technology could not be reached for comment before deadline. >The incident has raised renewed questions, however, about the undisclosed contact between ministers and businesses through Labor’s business roundtable and the LNP’s Solutions Queensland programs. >Cryptoloc Technology donated $102,735 to Labor and $60,000 to the LNP since 2021.Of the donations to Labor, including $18,040 on August 2 for a post-budget lunch, annual membership of the Queensland Labor Business Roundtable and “fundraiser with PM”. >Griffith University professor and Transparency International Australia chair A.J. Brown called on Labor and the LNP to commit to tightening their cash-for-access schemes. >“It’s always been one of the great festering holes in any healthy political integrity regime,” he said.“It’s cash not just to facilitate access, but to basically curry favour.“ >It should appear transparently in ministerial diaries.” >Prof Brown said the Labor government and retiring Attorney-General Yvette D’Ath had done some very good things for transparency, including introducing real-time donations disclosure in 2015. >However he argued both major parties’ cash-for-access programs were about fundraising rather than improving policy. “If it’s really access for the purposes of influencing public policy and decision making and informing it (cash) shouldn’t go to the party, it should not be a fundraiser,” he said. >Greens MP Michael Berkman has been a long-time opponent of the major parties’ practices, declaring in Parliament that cash for access was legalised corruption.
105. Just Crickets from the ALP cheer squad? Seriously though, all sides need to make ALL donations fully transparent and viewable by the public. If there is nothing to hide then should not be a problem.
106. No comments from the Always Lying Party luvvies?
107. Given how interested everyone seems to be in posting about the ALP these past few weeks, I'm surprised there isn't more engagement with this post. Where are all the ALP/Greens "cookers" we see posting day and night, downvoting everyone who isn't another "cooker"?
108. I'm not sure why, but us poor buggers in the real world could not possibly get away with things like "getting a donation", or "being lobbied" as it's a clear conflict of interest, and that's just at an individual business level. It's like we're held to a higher standard than those RUNNING A COUNTRY OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. Those people SHOULD be held to a higher standard because as the name implies, they are there to "serve the public", yet in reality they're more like "corporate/oligarch servants". Doesn't quite have the same ring to it huh? Until we get over this bullshit rule that "we don't talk about politics and religion", we're never going to solve any of our collective problems. Politicians and certain religious groups rely on people not being informed, which is fucking sad imho. In Australia, we had a train of thought... "Keep the bastards honest". Well, when you make an individual political party your identity, you're handing the bastards the the keys to your life... You're essentially no longer doing anything to keep them honest. I vote (not blindly follow and accept) for the political party that proves to me that they're going to do the best job for the most people. That right now is Labour, but if they changed to be more like the LNP, then I'm not going to vote for them just because "I supported Labour once or twice". We're going the way of America and I fucking HATE it.
