Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. The conspiracy theorist in me really wants to believe that they don't teach a lot of Australian history on purpose. The coalition doesn't have an amazing track record with economic management yet, beyond the boom years under Howard (there is even a lot of debate to be had there), people seem to just take it as an unquestioned truth.
2. I don't think most people who voted on the crime issue cared about what might or might not make a difference in 15-18 years, but would like to stop having their belongings stolen every week by the same group of people now.
3. And so what? It‚Äôs wild that people think that ‚Äúchildren should be punished for the faults of their parents (that they didn‚Äôt choose‚Äù is a rock solid argument. Then they‚Äôll go vote for the LNP if those kids end up committing crimes
4. Like I said, I have two kids, how much does it cost for two pieces of buttered bread, some cheese, ham and an apple? I garuntee you the people who don‚Äôt provide lunches, will happily spend what money they do have elsewhere. I‚Äôd suggest it‚Äôs less about the cost, because the cost is negligible, and more about parents who can‚Äôt be arsed to put a pack lunch together. It‚Äôs a choice. At some point, personal responsibility has to come into it.
5. ‚ÄúWhy are these scum bag children shop lifting!?‚Äù
6. It sounds cold, but statistically speaking, how many kids are actually going hungry? I grew up dirt poor, but my mum managed to send me to school with a few sangers, a muesli bar and an apple.
7. I was obviously joking, but it looks like Labour supporters have lost their sense of humour, along with their government of choice. I actually voted LNP because I don't like Labour's policies. I don't like them on a federal level, and I dislike them slightly less on a state level. It is surprising that so many people are surprised about an ALP loss when only 3/10 people preferenced the ALP. There must be some sheltered lives out there.
8. To maintain the status quo of supply, Brisbane needs 5000 new apartments per annum completed. This year is was less than 1200. Next year will be lower. It's been a long time since we've actually hit the minimum required. Scarcity of accommodation will never be overcome. The voters need people. They need workers. The workers need accommodation. Prices will keep going up no matter what.
9. Reread my comments. I completely agree that workers need protection.
10. Those are the things the unions are supposed to protect and fight for. Pay and working conditions. That's precisely their job. And where they should be focusing their efforts. The union bosses should not be earning $1m and other benefits. Unions are supposed to protect the workers not dictate a project.
11. I think you nailed it. They chose not to respond, as you suggested, because the internet isn't for them today. You can't tell people to go away, and then complain when they do.
12. I can‚Äôt speak on behalf of other people. Heck, I didn‚Äôt even vote.
13. Here‚Äôs your prize üèÜ Edit: people seem to have missed that this is a prize for being the most stupid which goes to this idiotic answer to a very reasonable question.
14. I never asked the question‚Ä¶. Oops.
15. The Gillard government was firmly against it, and the ‚Äúconscience‚Äù vote was open enough that Gay politician Penny Wong voted against it. They could have passed it. The Libs took it to a plebiscite, as it should have been and it passed.
16. I wouldn‚Äôt trust a cop to lie in bed straight lmao
17. Weird how our economy faired way better than NSW and life was relatively normal apart from the idiots down south demanding to cross the border so they could share the virus with us and make us have to go into lockdowns as well. How many days was Sydney in lockdown compared to Brisbane?
18. Did you not see how badly the LNP governments in NSWs did? QLD was so incredibly lucky. Heck so many of the pressures QLD has faced has been from the southern states flooding here.
19. Are you cookers still banging on about covid? Time to move on bro
20. I watched my staunchly economic conservative sister in law from an incredibly wealthy family vote against the libs at the last fed election. she said it was pretty fuckin amazing how shit they are.
21. Did I suggest banning people from voting lol? That‚Äôs quite the strawman you‚Äôve got there xD
22. Um that is not an equivalent example. Optional voting means if you want to you can, if you dont want to you don‚Äôt - the exact same system we have currently for breeding. In the above probably 2,3 and 4 wouldn‚Äôt have bothered showing up if it was optional
23. No one in Australia has the power to print money from nothing. Also the prison system is a massive business
24. You support people living in tents without sanitary facilities, living in fear, and getting rained on. Sick
25. its minor humour/trolling
26. I do not wish suffering on anyone. I was trying to point out that the thing that (rightly) offended you might also be a question you‚Äôd need to consider asking of your own family. Because the LNP platform that they voted for is all about ensuring that specific groups of people suffer. That does not mean that I condone the other (clearly not LNP-voting) commenters wish for your family to suffer either.
27. And Murdoch
28. $1.24M from Coal Australia straight into the LNP coffers. Wait till they drop developer donations from being illegal.
29. I love a cold IPA.
30. Agree - look at the differences in fibrosis, entitlements and on-site fatalities between unionised and non-unionised workplaces.
31. Heh if you think that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre actually walk off site you‚Äôve got some learning to do
32. Of course. I should probably edit my comment to refer to more specific unions.
33. yeah dude I'm totally sure that the most powerful and influential branch of the CFMEU being a criminal enterprise is entirely isolated to just that branch. there is NO WAY that any other branch is similar to the Victorian CFMEU. when were you diagnosed?
34. Exactly
35. My point exactly
36. No many members I know voted lib
37. No legacy stadium maybe, but massively overhauled public transport infrastructure which can be used by everyone not just those who enjoy sport/can't afford tickets to those events. When picking Olympic hosts, they are choosing places that are looking to build sustainable cities rather then a couple of new stadiums and a cardboard athletes' village 6 hours outside the city with no way of getting there. The sunshine coast rail extension; Brisbane metro and the new rail construction through the city are the legacy infrastructure.
38. Unbelievably stupid decision from Miles. Lost my vote as soon as he rejected the central finding from Quirks review. Unsure why Crisifulli needs another 100 day review when we just did one ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
39. What if every government thought that way? Why should QLD have a share in the world‚Äôs research fund. Do you think we should just sit back and be beholden to the rest of the world to do it for us?
40. As I said. It will now be filled by the same person contracting. Get a huge redundancy and get re employed as a contractor making heaps more. Great till you look where all that money comes from. My partner is not a health worker. Think you are thinking someone else.
41. Can't have ambos ramping if there are no ambos
42. Step 1. Privatise QAS so ambulances stop being free. Step 2. When it costs people a few hundred bucks for an ambulance, they won't call one. Especially during a cost of living crisis where a few hundred dollars can be the difference between making rent that week or not. Step 3. Less ambulances being called = less ramping.
43. I‚Äôm already working 2+hours unpaid overtime. I am not doing more for christafuckwit
44. yepppp
45. The main print mouthpiece in the state is Murdoch-owned. Most of the free-to-air networks that provide any kind of "local" news do not know what "investigative journalism" is. We know the LNP are full of shit when they stated repeatedly that they "hAvE a PlAn". However, the media will definitely go into bat for them, like they always do. We'll probably only find the truth once they are removed from Government in 4+ years time.
46. People are already dying because of our shit healthcare system because its an inefficient government run mess
47. Public urination can apparently become a public indecency charge that gets you on the sex offender registry in the US. I have no idea how true this is, but I imagine it‚Äôs a common defense used by offenders who‚Äôre arrested for flashing kids. And I didn‚Äôt know there was a sex offender registry for QLD (I only just found out [Jackway](https://www.couriermail.com.au/truecrimeaustralia/police-courts-qld/douglas-jackway-back-at-precinct-after-sex-offender-order-breach/news-story/3834cc576e87cd0c2e069afaa650ee93?amp) was released again back in April), can someone link pls?
48. That's not exactly what research shows. Not at all. [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11063965/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11063965/)
49. > > > I don't even know why I'm bothering with someone who thinks this is a thing SRS is absolutely a thing and a name used by a pretty large part of the trans community, in more recent years folks have instead used "Gender reassignment surgery" or "Gender affirmation surgery", but that name is absolutely still around, it used to literally be on the governments documentation for getting your gender marker changed on your birth certificate for example. The rest of their post is shite, but SRS is absolutely a thing/commonly used name for it.
50. [From the FAQ](https://cass.independent-review.uk/home/publications/final-report/final-report-faqs/) > *Did the Review reject studies that were not double blind randomised control trials in its systematic review of evidence for puberty blockers and masculinising / feminising hormones?* > No. There were no randomised control studies identified in the systematic reviews, but other types of studies were included if they were well designed and conducted. There's more information on that page, including a reference to the section of the report that sets out the the standards. Have you read the report or are you just regurgitating misinformation you've heard about it?
51. Causation vs correlation. Society is transphobic. Trans people will continue to die while we continue to spout bigotry in the media and online. Without access to gender affirming care enough trans people will commit suicide that medically it IS safer and more ethical to let young people take puberty blockers and hrt. If a small percentage decide to detransition later, de-transitioning is much much lower risk than not prescribing puberty blockers in the first place. Medical treatment and best practices weigh up the risks of prescribing something vs not prescribing it. This is why we have the pill for women, but no pill for men. The consequences of not taking the pill for women is pregnancy which increases the risk of death and other adverse health outcomes. That riskthat outweighs the side effects of the pill. The male pill has side effects but since men do not become pregnant there is no risk of harm if they don‚Äôt take them, that‚Äôs why they can‚Äôt be approved for sale.
52. Not accurate Hormone blockers reduce suicide attempts dramatically and give young people time to come to terms with their identity without making permanent decisions. No minors are having surgical interventions. Just isn't even a consideration. Some continue, some don't - but they're alive and have the choice thankfully. As someone in healthcare, the only agenda is reducing harm. Please don't believe the propaganda, it's nothing like the fear mongering nonsense out there.
53. It‚Äôs not science transgenders have by far higher suicide rates than anyone else. It‚Äôs 100% bleeding heart politics.
54. I'm sure there are plenty of legitimate medical rather than psychological reasons to intervene medically. If someone is not old enough to vote or marry or have tattoos, what in the world makes anyone think that they will be able to decide better at age 10 or 12 or 18(if their development has been interrupted) about what their biology is meant to be. There is no way to change your DNA. None. Somethings we have to accept as reality. If someone who is of sound mind and of age decides to change their gender, that is their business. Children is another story. If the law will protect them against alcohol and sigarets, it should protect them against harmful medical treatment as well.
55. Suicide rate doesn't change even if they transition. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7317390/
56. So i've been looking at sat maps and terrain maps etc of the area and i just can't fathom why this road is even in plan to begin with. Unless something has dramatically changed over the last 4 years (and well, a lot has i guess) but in that area specifically, why is there such a high demand to drive from caboolture to beerburrum? Unless you live in the glasshouse mountains area, there's not much reason to go there a lot. Sure, a few times for touristy things, or maybe a weekend trip etc, but that doesn't need a new highway. Did they build new housing estates up that way that i'm not familiar with so that people who live up there can drive to north brisbane/caboolture for work? And if so, what's wrong with the existing roads and bruce highway? Has there been a dramatic population boom in the sunshine coast? I know they were building a bunch of new estates when i moved away, but that wasn't enough for this.
57. So people voted to have their belongings stolen every week by different groups of people? Cool, yes, very smart and rational.
58. My point exactly, being fed at school is an incentive to go for some of these kids. Which keeps them off the streets and not committing crimes, plus you know kids deserve to be fed regardless of their parents ability to parent and or feed them
59. I'm not going to continue to argue a point with you if you refuse to see the reality that some people genuinely do not have the money to spend on lunch. I had mates growing up who's parents would scrimp and save like there was no tomorrow just to afford rent, bills and a meal on the table most nights. Sometimes they had sleep for dinner. It sounds like you have come from a privileged background and if that's the case I'm glad you have not had to experience that sort of poverty. The point I was trying to make is regardless of a parents choices a child deserves to be fed. They have done nothing to deserve the hand they've been dealt and saying that they deserve to go hungry because of their parents choices is pretty horrible.
60. Cool, even if that were the actual end-all case, why do the kids deserve to go hungry because they have shitty parents? Also, show me where the LNP has addressed this concern? What will they do, lock the kids up?
61. Please keep in mind this is anecdotal evidence from a few teacher mates spread through SEQ and NQ. It's worse up north with my mate in Townsville having a couple kids in his class that consistently come to school with no lunch, the guys down south and out west see it more sporadically but it's always at least a couple through their classes over the week. The kids up in Townsville without lunches are also the ones that are acting up in class and getting in trouble at school.
62. so you think it's funny to stick the boot into people who are worried about the future. nice one I hope your life improves now "Labour" are out lol
63. Agree about union bosses earning 1M. Still not convinced about unions dictating a project. How? What? Slow purposeful slow downs? Or just standing up for an achievable schedule in the face of a naive and clueless client/management about realistic schedules and timelines.
64. Looks like I‚Äôm the only winner in this sub today then. I‚Äôll take it.
65. What a fucking window licker, my god.
66. Idiots down south? You mean australians‚Ä¶? You mean the daughter trying to see her dying father who was stuck at the border when he died‚Ä¶? You mean queenslanders who couldnt come home‚Ä¶? Great leadership. How can you run a state when youre scared of a cold? We‚Äôll let the footy players in though. Idiot
67. Move on like labor and miles?
68. That's the secret, economic conservatism is a valid political principle and is pretty much followed by the ALP. LNP don't have a political philosophy to speak of, they're just influence peddling grifters.
69. You questioned whether ‚Äòpeople who don‚Äôt even know what they‚Äôre putting on their forms‚Äô should be voting. Probably most of them aren‚Äôt particularly informed but some of those are genuinely convinced they do. Is it really better to kill off the vote of an apathetic person to give weight to one who is deranged or seeks to boost the interests of people/parties who would actively harm the rights of select groups of people if they were to gain power? And some apathetic voters who might have an inkling can be manipulated by a shitty media into not voting, convinced that they won‚Äôt make a difference. It‚Äôs a terrible idea on many levels. I‚Äôve definitely got sympathy for the idea that some people are too stupid to be allowed to vote, but the reality we are operating within should give you no faith in the concept of optional *or* restricted voting on this basis.
70. Oh, so you're just disingenuous, could've said that a while ago and saved my time.
71. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-28/union-construction-overhaul-teenage-apprentice-death-safety/102912554 https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-14/qld-cmfeu-union-members-rally-brisbane/102854696
72. You know QLD branch went through a royal commission right? They came out clean. I assume you knew that as you are acting like you know everything?
73. They probably would have before, too. My partner and his brother work trades and a lot of their colleagues love Trump (including BIL). I‚Äôd be shocked if they voted Labor based on that alone.
74. Yes
75. "get employed as a contractor making heaps more" what the fuck hahaha so this person has the skills to negotiate a higher pay than they're currently getting? using what leverage? why did they not do it before being booted? like what the fuck are you talking about lmfao I really hope you continue this conversation so I can tease the realisation out of you that you have no idea how the job market works
76. Reading this makes me want to cry
77. Privatise everything!
78. Like how in most other states there is a fee for calling the ambulance?
79. I had no clue we already had one I've tried to find one before. I thought it was private for the offenders safety
80. Firstly we are not talking about gender affirmation surgery. Secondly, did you read the methodology of this study? The design is terrible. I'm not sure I would even pass an undergrad assignment with this. You can't compare people who underwent vasectomy or tubal ligation (or no surgery) who are not identifiable as transgender (many straight and cis gender people would be in this comparison group, if not the majority) with people who have undergone gender affirming surgery and are transgender. This research is large but doesn't actually tell us anything about suicide risk pre and post gender affirming surgery in transgender individuals as the title implies. The only conclusion that could be drawn from it could be that transgender individuals have a higher suicide risk that the general population which, duh. Edit: here is a systematic review collating several studies that includes more appropriate control groups and comparisons. Unsurprisingly, gender affirming surgery lead to a decrease, but it was still higher than the general population controls. Who would have thought people politicising and stigmatising your very existence would have a negative impact on your mental health. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/26318318231189836 Please don't cherry pick studies to support your agenda without carefully assessing them first.
81. Context is important here. They're talking about Children. Trans youth under 18 *very* rarely undergo bottom surgery except for ultra specific unique-to-individual cases
82. https://i.redd.it/a9ul1zo3evtc1.jpeg They can say all they want in the FAQ, read the actual study and you can see that they -absolutely- rejected studies for these reasons.
83. I‚Äôm sorry but no one is transphobic. It‚Äôs propaganda instilled in people to further create division and encourage classist warfare by the deep state elite. Battle of the sex‚Äôs, races, genders etc- are completely artificial and I will not be a mouth piece for which that I protest. I love you, although I don‚Äôt know you, and I respect you. I don‚Äôt care who you like, or who you marry; I believe you have value and are worthy of love and acceptance. What people are phobic towards is government agenda. Similar to uncanny valley; people just don‚Äôt like having doctrine shoved down their throat. You don‚Äôt call an atheist religious-phobic; but I can guarantee you there‚Äôs atheists out there who get a bad rub from watching a show and having lots of religious cues or hidden agenda etc. throughout. You and I might not care, but they do; and it doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre religion-phobic; it‚Äôs just they get a strange knee jerk reaction due to their predisposition so programming - which they can‚Äôt be blamed for, just like no one else can- these predispositions are mostly societally constructed and for purpose- purpose being division. Also some understand corporations and government and media are pushing narratives - and NEVER ONCE have these governments or groups pushed a narrative where it was completely and utterly selfless, and everyone gained but themselves. No, they do it for their own gain; and dividing us is part of that. So long as we fight amongst eachother, call eachother names, trumper, magas, Kamala‚Äôs, blue team, red team, transphobic, cishet, dumb bitch, beta male; So long as we continue to play their game and fight eachother, the longer we play their game and lose, together. Better to stand up and join together; than succumb together. ‚ù§Ô∏è
84. Not propaganda, ironic of you you to say that though- considering it‚Äôs only mentioned on clearly biased websites. Here is the study that goes over 30 years and proves this to be true. It‚Äôs horrible, but it‚Äôs also a mental illness and should handled with care and not affirmation. I say this as someone with a trans sibling and cousins. This issue is very close to my heart, and sadly this is very much the case. You do not affirm the ramblings of someone who is going through psychosis and delusions of grandeur- this is a really cruel thing that we have tried to normalise. It‚Äôs very easy to sit there and agree with it when it‚Äôs not happening to you/your family. Trust me, I now know the difference. https://issuepedia.org/2011/02/22/Long-Term_Follow-Up_of_Transsexual_Persons_Undergoing_SRS I fear as time goes on and we get more longitudinal studies, we will be even more alarmed at the barbarity we are committing on kids right now; like this study which says children under 18 are the HIGHEST rates of suicide in the trans community: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10027312/ so here‚Äôs a shoutout to the corporations and political parties taking advantage of our suffering; LEAVE OUR KIDS ALONE.
85. I‚Äôm pretty sure, that you ‚Äúknew‚Äù your gender at an early age. And it seems like you hit the jackpot and your outward sexual physical attributes match that idea of your self. Gender and sex are so complicated. There is a significant amount people who feel apathetic to gender, who strongly feel they have a particular gender or no gender. And there are plenty of people in the world who have chromosomes, or internal organs, different to the gender they live as, or hormones different to their assigned gender and they have no idea. You could be one of those and just not know.
86. Your study doesn't come to the conclusion you do and you have misunderstood it. It's assessing suicide risk overtime throughout treatment, not before and after treatment or the risk of having treatment vs not having treatment. Did you actually read the study? You really don't have to read far to realise that you have misunderstood this lol.
87. Nope it's basically being seen as a ring road for north Brisbane residents to access the Sunshine Coast without going into the Bruce because of the bottlenecks through bald hills, Nudgee, North lakes that have existed since Joseph played fullback for Jerusalem. You can tell why the community is up in arms, right?
88. Do you think that if a criminal is put behind bars, another one spawns in its spot and commits the crimes that the first one would have done? Lol. They aren't limitless lemmings, they can be stopped from committing crimes.
89. Your first paragraph makes a fair point, I‚Äôm not saying LNP are better on this front, that‚Äôs a separate issue. I was just making the point parents should be providing lunch for their kids, not the tax payers.
90. I will take your word for it because life is a lot harder these days than it was when I was a kid, so I can see this as a possibility, especially with the cost of living crisis.
91. Thanks buddy. I'm sure all our lives will improve.
92. I've seen projects halted because the union didn't think enough trees were being planted (that's between the developer and council). I've seen projects halted because the wrong bottled water was being offered. I've seen projects halted because the union didn't think the end colour was right. Unions are there to keep the workers safe and fairly paid. I will never disagree with that.
93. I know. Imagine asking that question and then people getting riled up over an answer that was on par with it. Almost as bad as getting worked up and hysterical about an election result.
