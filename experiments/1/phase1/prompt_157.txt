Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Why do people look at News Limited, read a surface level take including obviously pushing an agenda, and go "oh this must be true". I can handle people being dumb, I can't handle people being so obtuse that they take away their own rights. Every woman in QLD should have showed up.
2. I'm not happy about it, and my close friends are super progressive. Unfortunately we are outnumbered by bogans. Steve Irwin would be ashamed
3. the LNP won't need to do heavy lifting. KAP will introduce, DC will allow conscience vote, they're absolves of a lot of blame. it might not genuinely in their plan, but they will not actively shoot down a proposal
4. Plus it can be easily overturned in appeals by other MPs. It's not worth the effort.
5. I was replying to the above guy who deleted his dumb comment about mining companies being overtaxed, didnt think i needed a sarcasm tag in context
6. I dont think Norway is a utopia, ive been there. But they at least treat their common resources as a common resource for public benefit
7. Do you think the media has ever been on the side of the Labour party? The ALP has lost touch with the very heart land that created the Labour party. Labour only has themselves to blame even after the Katters have them a hail Mary.
8. Someone doesn't understand the word "bigotry", what a bizarre way to attempt to use the word 😂
9. Ok, shoot.
10. Ok thank you. Ill pull up the offshore oil rigs to rent website
11. Rather than voting for “change” alone maybe vote for evidence based policy for the issues of concern. Study after study has shown that punitive action and detention centres only increase recidivism. Crime doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Rather than abusing the rights of children maybe vote for a fit-for-purpose social safety net, education, and community building. All of which are proven to actually reduce crime and prevent recidivism.
12. How do you propose fixing it for those you care for?
13. Nah, your way of poking fun of it wasn’t great. Don’t downplay the crime itself, make fun of the idea that it is happening constantly on every street corner
14. My 25 yo daughter had someone break in to her home while she was in it last week, brazenly taking her car keys and the jewelry she was given for her 18th and 21st by her now deceased Aunt. Get fucked with your downplaying of the emotional and mental effect of having crime committed against you.
15. The regional areas of Australia are not the safest in the world, the cities are the safest in the world.
16. Youth crime is trending down as a state level but trending up in regional Queensland. You know, a lot of the places where Labor lost their seats. With Walker making a fool of himself the last few years and Harper the idiot brushing off any criticism a lot of the people in Townsville were voting against them rather than against Miles.
17. I've personally had my house raided by kids and I can tell you it's not a good feeling. I was out of the house for 60 minutes. I literally had anxiety for years because of it. It's not just replaceable items. They stole stuff that was passed down for many generations. So again, fuck you for downplaying any type of crime you piece of shit
18. >I still am not convinced that this is evidence of a youth crime epidemic. So you're ignoring the lived experience of people because it doesn't suit the narrative you want to believe. That's a bit arrogant. >Security camera footage has increased and is really being harnessed by the media. I showed you footage uploaded by someone a block down from us, not the media. >Those of us that are younger, live in the same suburbs and are more on the ABC side of things are not exposed to it at all and it is not even remotely a fear. I am on "the ABC side of things". The ABC has reported [on this issue](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-05-25/goondiwindi-residents-terrified-as-youths-torch-stolen-cars/100133312) [multiple times](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-04/insurance-premiums-price-of-a-youth-crime-crisis/102295936). You just don't want to hear it. >Sorry to hear that you are afraid, wouldn't be nice. I don't want your meaningless apology. I want you to stop being so ignorant. >so it's not unjustified. So violent breaking and entering is not unjustified in your view? What an obtuse comment. If this is how progressive Brisbanites reflect on the issues affecting regional Queensland, get ready for a long time in opposition.
19. Crime is down from when? What time period? From last year or last month? Or from when labor took power? Like you can clearly see a massive increase especially in regional areas except for the last year or two…
20. Ah yes let’s coddle offenders and release them on bail after 40 offences. Look I’ve been to uni too mate and studied statistical analysis of research data, but you’re putting all your focus on quantitative research and totally ignoring qualitative research which is just as important. As in people’s sentiment and anecdotal experience. And the experiences and sentiments AND stats show that violent youth offending and violent offences in general ARE ON THE RISE. So stop trying to gaslight
21. The Dunning-Kruger effect is on full display with this one. ‘But but the crime statistics show it’s lower’. Recorded crime statistics for some offence categories DO NOT accurately reflect the actual level of crime in the community. This is because the number of incidents recorded are affected by other factors. In particular, the public willingness to report crime. Many crimes which occur are not reported to police and will therefore not be recorded - for example, a large number of assaults, sexual assaults and robberies are not reported to police. Reported crime is not the same as actual crime. Absolute 🤡.
22. Which opinions are not truthful exactly? I don't see anything within what I wrote that isn't an accurate reflection of the current reality. Or, perhaps you just wish to deny that reality. Is that it?
23. Your "experts" = dude trust me
24. 😘
25. No, you're moving the goal post. Your original claim was that people must think it's either fascist or communist. That has nothing to do with media.
26. Lol. What has the LNP actually said on this topic? AFAIK its some combination of not supporting late term abortion, and wanting to restrict it to the first trimester. Do you unironically support unrestricted abortion to full term (or should I use the Orwellian alternative "reproductive healthcare")? If not full term, where is your cutoff exactly? I think your average person on the street has sensible views on reasonable restrictions and this is actually reflected in the result.
27. Yep, it's an absolute slap in the face to throw out a decent government running a great economy, let's not forget tool subsidies for people doing apprenticeships, making mining companies pay more all because dickheads did what they were told to do by their sky television controllers. Dumb fucks with short memories. Based on this result a government doesn't need to run a good economy doesn't need to address homelessness and poverty doesn't need to reform things that need reforming doesn't need do any of the things that the fucking media criticise the government of the day for supposedly not doing. All a government needs to do to get elected now is talk enough shit and spam the airwaves with a plethora of worthless one dollar slogans. Oh yeah and accuse the incumbent of being communists or something to that effect.
28. They’re not lying about anything. It’s changing the gender on their forms not the sex. If anything keeping it incorrect would be heaps dishonest. But I guess you can go on living in terror if you want?
29. I hope youre enjoying the first day of the tyrannical overlords in power. 🤣
30. and not once did i suggest that one family owning the majority of the media was not a problem. simply Murdoch is not the reason the labor losing. hell being in NSW I heard more positivity about Miles then the liberal candidate. Hell the whole abortion thing should have been a good nail in their coffin, but people voted change. Something that happens literally all the time, consistently, over and over. Its easier to be the person spruiking that you will fix the woes of the state then the incumbent trying to say give me more time to fix it
31. What a pointless thing to say. Like yeah obviously? But government policy is also a huge factor. You have no real argument do you?
32. lol you’re so patronizing. You have no understanding of the nuances of statistical analysis, have taken first year stats correlation doesn’t equal causation, are probably a young labor stooge who has no working class background. I’ll tell you what neoliberalism means; it means the erosion of working people’s wealth which is then consolidated into the wealthy. Which has occurred at a rapid pace under federal and state labor and liberals. Labor puts band aids on it like all liberals but it does not address the root cause; the inherently exploitative nature of capitalism. Labor is turning away from unions, turning away from its working class base and being punished for it. Patronizing them, calling them stupid, gaslighting them. Examine your own parties failures.
33. my argument post 2020 was, the total Covid expenditure would have gold plated all our infrastructure needs. Instead we have post world war 2 infrastructure expected to support mass immigration. Wait for a drought to affect the east coast.
34. Jeeze, sound like a pleasant guy... I'm glad any party someone full of hate like you would lose an election, sees like a good thing.... but yes, cope harder
35. Then tell me what Fascism is then?
36. You clearly don't know what it means if you want the government to be in control of petrol mate.
37. Things like investment and removing red tape around additive manufacturing. Investing in things like tafe and taking more active steps to create more blue collar jobs, not just bloating government departments. Properly subsisiding childcare. Maybe actually taking a cut from the ore we mine. Since its unlikely that mass immegration will ever not be a thing significant investment in infastructure, cross river rail is great but we need so much more than that.
38. I don’t live in qld mate so I didn’t vote for anyone , I don’t care who people vote for as everyone has their reasons and democracy works via majority. You think you are above the majority of Queenslanders simply because they voted differently to you . You and that attitude are the reason people vote against your side , sanctimonious arrogant assholes galore 🥳🥳🥳
39. bugga of dikhed
40. Yep - the Health Department is desperate but it’s all good we have trains and lots of them
41. You seem to be conflating some things. Public sector doctors wages have nothing to do with Medicare. They are state funded. Medicare is federal and unrelated to this election. What is your source for stating that public sector doctor's wages are the lowest on record? I sincerely doubt this is correct. Medicare rebates for GP's in the private sector however, are yet to catch up after the lengthy rebate freeze that occurred under a Liberal government.
42. I never said it was free. Pretty rich of you to call someone a dimwit while you spout false information. On that note though ambulance is definitely not a fee for service in the way that it is in most other states (except for Tassie). It is the same as the other emergency services in QLD, there is a levy to cover costs to keep the state safe. As it should be.
43. [removed]
44. Why are you getting so upset? I’m aware there would’ve been voters who are exceptions like yourself presumably. But I am being factual. The policies passed, the politicians voted in & inheriting the most and leaving the least is all factual.
45. I agreed. I actually think it's the low social economic suburbs that vote lnp.
46. No I wouldn’t of. In fact if as a country we decided Gen Z (my Gen) and Gen Alpha are going to have to sacrifice for nothing for the greater good then I’d be onboard. Not everyone is as selfish as your generation champ Your argument is so dumb it hurts to read. Hey chief, you realise the silent and greatest generations had less people and more resources than boomers and didn’t have a higher standard of living? 😂😂 It’s got everything to do with policy and nothing to do with population or resources we are so resource rich it’s insane. Norway have $10Trillion in the bank just because their mining policies for one example
47. Lets be real it doesn't. $50 every 6 months is $1.90 a week. If your family was struggling with that you'd be in a food and or housing program already. Please stop glazing the minuscule changes made by a government looking to be re-elected.
48. Are we seriously arguing that 20% of rego was the best the could have done for cost of living? Because if so then all governments are cooked.
49. There are no longer any private (adult) prisons in QLD. The two that were private was Arthur Gorrie (GEO) and Gatton (Serco). All since 2020 (by memory) are now public owned including the new Lockyer Valley one.
50. You lost me at 'Guardian'. Would've almost been tempted to have a look until that.
51. So a labour initiative?
52. much easier to learn when your stomach isn't grumbling and empty.
53. Yep. And there should be capacity for horribly violent crimes. But also isn’t the focus on rehabilitation? If 15 years isn’t enough to rehabilitate a teenager then wasn’t is? How does 25 years change things for that family. How does 35. What would be the ideal outcome for you? Capital punishment for them instead of jail time? Acknowledge that issue then work to prevent the next generations of potential problems.
54. IIRC the best deterrent, according to studies, is the likelihood of being caught and punished
55. I’ll defer to this study from UNSW from a quick google. But I’ve read similar studies over the years. So yes I don’t think it’s a deterrent. https://www.unsw.edu.au/newsroom/news/2020/07/do-harsher-punishments-deter-crime#:~:text=The%20myth%20of%20deterrence&text=“The%20severity%20of%20punishment%2C%20known,is%20the%20likelihood%20of%20apprehension.
56. Jail time is not an effective deterrent for serious crimes, no. The vast majority of such crimes are committed in the moment. Very few are premeditated, and even then, are done under the assumption that they won't be caught. If you look at places with capital punishment, like the US, you will quickly see that that harsh punishments in general are ineffective. Since the prison system has no real ability to rehabilitate, and in fact severely limits your ability to reintergrate into society and your job prospects, contact with it increases the likelihood you'll reoffend. You treat the material conditions leading to crime in the first place. You can lose a hand for theft in Saudi Arabia, but hungry people still steal bread.
57. I work in the youth detention centre. Detention is not a deterrent. I see the same kids come in over and over and over again. We are also not allowed to offer programs (rehabilitative opportunities) to youth who are not sentenced. Out of the 160 kids in the centre at the moment, only FIVE ARE SENTENCED. The rest are being held on remand.
58. Ah yeah sorry. It’s the only part of the policy they actually care about to speak of. And it’s at the top of all their list. And they dedicate stories to just talking about tougher crime. Also, most of the points you raised from their policy aren’t social infrastructure commitments to prevent. They are post crime intervention. Get off this bullshit about single word semantics to argue against. They made sure it was clear tough on crime is the only thing they care about.
59. I’m 45 and I was called a boomer 5 years ago by some kid that looked about 12.
60. Oh dude for sure. Leave those paint chips off from the hailstorms. Keeps the rent down too
61. The figures reveal a reduction in the rate of youth offences of 6.7%. In addition, the total number of unique youth offenders has reduced by 2% since last financial year and by 18% since 2012/13. The rate of unique youth offenders has reduced by 4% since last financial year and by a staggering 32% since 2012/13 [Latest Crime Statistics from Queensland Police Service](https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/100936)
62. Stadium
63. Why would anyone do that? Why would I want to make myself worse off for the benefit of people I don't care for? That doesn't make any sense.
64. Sadly, they own the vast majority of the local papers and have forever. While this doesn't matter now with younger generations, it's preconditioned into older people (50+) that they're the best source of news *"Because they're "local". They have journalists in every town because they own all the newspapers everywhere, so they get the information direct from the people".* Of course, that hasn't really been true in the last 25 years since highspeed internet became a thing, but that is how Murdoch captured their brains. Obviously they were never a good news source, but that was how they'd explain it.
65. People don't want to think for themselves, it's too hard. They want someone else to tell them what to think so they can get back to their insignificant lives.
66. Have you evan read the proposed changes KAP want? I'll give you a hint, its not for the recriminalisation of abortion, it's a couple of very minor changes around the edges which amounts to the following: - Abortions after 22 weeks are no longer permitted for social reasons. That simply means you need to decide before the baby is viable that your not ready to be a mother. - Doctors who conscientiously object won't be forced to refer you to a doctor who doesn't object. You'd still be free to find another doctor on your own. Even before 2018, when abortion was technically illegal, we still had 14000 abortions every year, and many of these resulted in prosecutions? Recriminalisation of abortion would have no impact, so why would they bother doing it.
67. Absolutely. They’d get the law changed for a couple of years, get smashed in the next election, lose all possibility of winning again for the next 30 years, and then the law would be changed back again. It wouldn’t be worth it.
68. My apologies there was no comment above except deleted. I have edited my comment and just provided facts without commentary
69. *labor, They’ve lost touch have they? Through wage increases, tax cuts and lowering youth crime to name a few
70. Do you expect any less from that poster? Look at their replies in here. Completely clueless.
71. We're in mountains of debt, chiefly because of our response to Covid. We're at $135 billion while NSW sits at $95 billion in the red. Various programs have been wound back or cancelled. Our healthcare system is held together with thoughts and prayers, with [hiring freezes](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-06-27/victoria-hospitals-hiring-freeze-budget-cuts-staffing-health/104028710) in place for critical frontline staff. Everyone I know in the public sector finds their department shrinking. And while there's no shortage of oxygen thieves in government, I can assure you there's a good amount of people doing important work who are having to look to other states for work. Our ambulance system is [stuffed.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-09/ambulance-ramping-leaves-victorians-without-paramedics/104289358) We're at risk of [having our credit rating downgraded](https://smallcaps.com.au/victoria-looming-credit-crisis-debt-downgrade-infrastructure/) (we already have the lowest rating of any state). A significant amount of our revenue is from [fining each other.](https://www.theage.com.au/politics/victoria/victoria-is-the-fines-capital-expected-to-rake-in-almost-1b-this-financial-year-20240317-p5fcz6.html) Which we do at twice the rate of the Queensland (the next most heavily-fined). To hold Victoria up as a paragon of good governance or anything remotely aspirational is not wise at this point in time. Sure, we're fantastically progressive and have done very well in many areas, I'd temper your enthusiasm about how things are going down here.
72. Are t they in a colossal amount of debt and adding to it every month with no end in sight?
73. The principality of sealand springs to mind, just don’t do a Norfolk Island and demand Australia nor Queensland provide social assistance such as universal healthcare.
74. The evidence is that when children remain in the environment that the majority are living in, is that they will never stop the rinse and repeat cycle of crime. Education is available to 99% of kids but the parents don’t take them. The parents don’t cook for them, they do not have a safety net in their family home. Increase social and psychological help and they won’t attend the appointments, Increase home visits and mandatory removals will increase. I know the revolving door, all the good work done at detention centres is lost when they return home. It is time to get tough, more removals need to happen when there is no improvement with repeat offenders.
75. Did you read the actual policy on this matter or you just running with the slogan? Have a read of it, you might learn that it isn't about locking up 10 year olds.
76. thats horrible for her to go through, but m not going to pretend a subjective experience is an important objective representation of reality.
77. I can do that too. My kids will never have a home because idiots keep voting for LNP to ramp up property prices. Everyone has a sob story.
78. So your solution to this horrible event is to put the kids into jail so they can be abused and fall further into delinquency and then return in 10 years as adult criminals? Are you some kind of moron?
79. Crime has been on a steady decline since 2008. People commit crimes in regional areas simply because it's easier to get away with. It's inexcusable, but it is not a new thing.
80. If you went to uni, you'll know anecdotal evidence barely qualifies as evidence at all.
81. Crime as a whole has gone down, I haven’t cherry-picked offenses. Even if an increase in unreported crime were the case, how are unreported crimes the governments fault? Better yet, how do you know there's an increase in crime if it's largely unreported? But yes, I get slapped with the overused "Dunning-Kruger" label. People like you learn a new term from a podcast or something so you can polish your superiority complex.
82. Reality is that most lnp talking points are manufactured by media
83. The experts with decades of proven experience working in those fields, vs "Down Under Patriot Bro 4 Lyfe" on your Social Media feed telling it "like it is" based off "research". I got a question. I'll design and build you an aircraft. From scratch. I know what I'm doing as "I've done my research" watching "Lefties are Betas" dude on my Insta feed. Then I'll get Airbus to do the same. Now I'll ask you to hop on board. With all your loved ones. Which plane will you choose? Which plane has the best chance of... Performing like a plane? The "Sovereign Citizen-300” or the Airbus?
84. I mean take a look around to be honest. Half of the comments on here are acting like we’ve just put Nazis in power. This is democracy, the majority have spoken. You can be upset your party didn’t win that’s fine but you’ve just called the majority of Queenslanders a “waste of space” because they didn’t vote for the party you did. Frankly get over it or pack your car up and fuck off.
85. This is not correct. Your birth certificate has your biological sex recorded - not a "gender" - the laws deliberately conflate and confused gender with sex. It allows a male to record "female" on his birth certificate and be treated as such. I'm not living in terror. Women are.
86. You LITERALLY downplayed murdochs influence in your previous comment.
87. It's not pointless. We do not live in a black and white world. Crime has been decreasing since 2008, the whole discussion is moot. We have a criminal code, law enforcement, and courts. Due process still exists, and each case is unique. You can't throw the book at every single defendant because of something called precedent. Meaning they have to base their punishment on someone elses sentence for the same crime in similar circumstances. Labor intended on tackling the root cause, not override due process with authoritarian-like punishment. Throwing a kid in prison for 10 years will not solve the issue. It will just create more problematic and institutionalized adults. Therefore, there will be more generational crime.
88. Covid spending was for dealing with an emergency and our current financial woes are the recovery process of that expenditure. To spend that on infrastructure continuously would put us in permanent state of financial crisis. And it would have to be a continuous spend because infrastructure needs maintenance and rebuilding. It isn't a one time spend. The maintenance costs of the road to Burketown would keep us broke. It would be like buying a good quality car and never servicing it.
89. *lose. Imbecile pro max
90. An authoritarian one party state characterized by dictatorial control. A state owned petrol station has nothing to do with that.
91. Literally nobody has said they want the government to be entirely in control of petrol. We're talking about a couple of fuel stations to drive competition in an effort to keep prices of private vendors down. What the fuck does that have to do with fascism? Dumb prick
92. We *were* taking a cut from what is mined under the Miles government and it was subsidising electricity costs and public transport and was slated to subsidise bulk billing GP clinics and feeding school kids. The LNP have promised to reverse that. This is why people vote against their own interests.... FUCK
93. Ah yes, the classic "Not good enough".
