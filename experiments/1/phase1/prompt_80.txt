Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. I grew up in NorthWest Queensland and now live in Brisbane. You always here about the south east bubble and how people in Brisbane think the state ends at Gympie. Moving here, i was shocked at just how true that is, and this sub is a great example of that insualted thinking. I have had people on this sub argue that the problems people in Cairns and Townsville are facing are not relevent to state politics because they are a minority of the population. Its crazy.
2. I’m going to take a drink every time I read the phrase “echo chamber” for the next 36 hours lol.
3. You could make a case for this sub being more pro Green than Pro Labor. Ultimately it's a left wing and an anti conservative subreddit. There is no balance. Imagine how fucked the world would be if we left subreddit's govern society
4. Its crazy... I have been keeping an eye on it, and the bias is remarkable.
5. Can you please provide some examples for your claims? Could you also explain while during John Howards terms the government had multiple surplus budgets and essentially got the Australian economy down to very little debt?
6. Agreed. Once I saw that Amanda Stoker was running and will likely be elected, I knew that no good was going to happen. I honestly don't know why I'm being downvoted as I said that I voted for the ALP. I'd never vote for the LNP. I'll admit I'm more of a teal voter but I do not want ~~Crisafulli~~ Bleijie running the state.
7. Yep, LCQ #1 for me! Hoping they get enough votes for the major parties to take notice
8. This is what I'm after thank you for you views. How do you think liberal would do better in that situation tho? As for youth crime I thought I saw a study that said youth crime was going down (it may have been for another state so I could be wrong here) I personally hate the phrase adult time adult crime, it seems like such a cop out. How effective is jail for adults? We should be investing time and effort into why these kids are acting out and dealing with it instead of throwing them in a box and starting the cycle of repeat offenders early.
9. From a disillusioned moderate voter, I appreciate your detailed write up. There are elements that both parties do better in but neither party will excel by itself in all that is required and both parties are ultimately beholden to their corporate interests.
10. Union stop work days are 4x that of Victoria. Ok. Why are they stopping? What are they saying? What are the differences between here and Vic?. That stat is pretty meaningless without context. You have just used "higher number bad" and continued on. This is an area I don't know much about so I'm genuinely asking those questions and not just being a dick.
11. Yeah. I liked him and his mob. Rex Patrick posts a lot of stuff about integrity in parliament which is great reading.
12. Doesn’t really matter preferential voting means your vote goes to whoever you put second last anyways
13. I don’t disagree with this, good to see primary’s not going to the majors cause they are really taking it for granted that there are only really 2 parties to vote for
14. This is how I voted. It hurt for me to put LNP third, but I sure as hell wasn’t risking the BSCC’s accidentally getting in.
15. If the KAP has the deciding votes then we are going to hell in a hand basket. We may even see a push for a new state; Northeast Australia.
16. Imagine Katter with some power and what it means for society. The guy is unstable.
17. I think that is possibly the worst outcome for the state because the LNP will have to bend over backwards to keep KAP/ON happy. They will have to do all sorts of batshit crazy to hold together that alliance (though it may mean going back to the polls early when it all falls apart which would be a plus)
18. I'm praying for ALP minority. Even better.
19. Internal polling claims to show KAP doing well in two NQ seats and ON in one CQ seat. If the regional swing is uneven, we might be looking at an LNP-KAP-ON minority government.
20. Hasn't Crisafulli stated there wouldn't be a LNP minority government, i.e. he'd leave it to Labor to try to govern a coalition? (Sorry for the paywall: https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/politics/queensland/crisafulli-categorically-rules-out-leading-a-minority-government-20241025-p5klfx.html )
21. Labour is heavily funded by the union movement. Everyone has a motivation to influence politicians the LNP is not on its own for receiving money for which someone wants something in exchange for.
22. It's the Australian values of fair play. We see everything in terms of sport, and if QLD won the State of Origin every year, even the most die-hard would root for the cockroaches. Unfortunately unlike sport, there are very frightening real world consequences for this mindset in politics.
23. I'm sure the "time for a change" mindset is astroturfed. If it was genuine, the LNP would not have held Brisbane City Council for 24 effin' years.
24. That's a big part of it I agree. *"Give the other side a go!"*
25. This is exactly my mother when it comes to voting and she is 85.
26. Yeah policy matters, I normally vote for whichever doesn’t smear campaign the other party, bc clearly they don’t have enough going for their own policy to get them through. Have strong policy, take it to the election, follow through, come up with more good policies.
27. THIS, & also, Steven Miles wasn’t voted in & he can fuck right off!!
28. Yet crime is at an all time low ,go figure .
29. Re youth crime. The liberal loving media have been beating up this issue all year they use against labour. A simple google search will show that youth crime numbers are DOWN. Not saying there is no issue but it is not a runaway problem that they are claiming
30. Live in regional Qld......I am hearing about youth crime consistently .......I have lived here 8 years, don't lock the shed or garage, occasionally lock the house......youth crime isn't really an issue here
31. Yup. Hawke's The Accord was both the best and worst thing to happen. People finally got a lot of what unions had campaigned for decades, but at the cost of curtailing their rights to protest and directly get involved. As well, the neoliberal economic policies as you state really did dismantle a lot of solid social bonds in society built up with the original Labor party, and the post-WWII welfare system and union power. It was a hollowing out of the party and society itself to private interests. Then again you read Gough Whitlam's book on his time as PM and within Labor in the 60s he's describing all the same party politics BS as now, unfortunately there are a lot of people who are content with either the status quo being bad, or on using the political system to further their career rather than do anything useful. This creates apathy in voters when these people get into power and seemingly do sweet FA in terms of policies. We also have Murdoch who has a stranglehold on media in this country, and in his reducing every media outlet to nothing better than a gossip rag, politicians are paralysed from having real ideas or speaking with any confidence in their visions otherwise they are pilloried because Murdoch naturally is deeply rightwing. I really like Miles though, what a breath of fresh air to have a guy just be upfront about doing shit that matters like public transport fares, power bill rate cuts, or free school lunches. He's in the unenviable position but in a way that's emboldened him to give less of a toss about all the circus demanded by the media and the wider political system to conform to a hollowed out agenda of chipping at the sides.
32. Dude the offer for that hug still stands if you need it
33. Conservatives don't need to run on facts or positive anything. All they need to do now is say "these people are the devil" and all the little right wing freaks will gobble it up.
34. And I understand rural and regional areas are angry, I left northern Queensland for a better quality of life , less racism, less conservatism, and more opportunities . Unfortunately people aren’t as attracted to work in regional and rural areas which in turn decreases service capacity and snowballs the problem.
35. “… until 12 months before the election…”?? You mean around the time Miles became premier? All these idiots saying ‘we need a change’ … you’ve just bloody well had one!!! Give the guy a chance to show what he can do first! It’ll be disastrous to have LNP in power, who will undo all the good, and set us back 50 years (or more!!!)
36. Youth crime is in a downward trend and significant areas that don’t have access to the number of healthcare and early intervention services, proving that those strategies work. LNP will never focus on regional areas . Labour has increased funding to support people in regional areas access central healthcare services through transport, accommodation subsidy, Telehealth, and incentives to attract staff . LNP would slash a lot of that https://www.qao.qld.gov.au/reports-resources/reports-parliament/reducing-serious-youth-crime#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20young%20people,to%2010%2C304%20in%202021–22.
37. > What labor is doing now may be working but I know there’s a lot of people saying too little too late. So those people think voting LNP is going to improve things? *"Hey this may be working, but I'm marginally unhappy with how it went so let's vote for the party who will definitely make it worse"*. > turning their backs on mining and farming communities This is just untrue. The previous LNP government gutted the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and has tried to block state ownership of energy infrastructure which would employ tens of thousands of Queenslanders in long-term, reliable, well-paying *careers*, so that they can sell public owned assets to their mates and international companies that would suppress local job creation, undercut existing workforces, and ship profits overseas. Work a physical job? The LNP have tried to prevent Labour from strengthening workplace protections. They hate workers. They hate hi-vis. Work in manufacturing? Get ready for the LNP to send your job overseas. Work in mining? Get ready to have less safe, less secure, lower-paying jobs available because the LNP only care about mining to the extent that it makes *them* rich. And when the mining jobs start disappearing because the LNP sold all of our infrastructure, land, ports etc to overseas companies to line their own pockets and the rest of the world has moved on from buying so much of what we dig out of the ground, you can fight over the scraps of whatever other rural jobs exist, because the LNP will have cancelled Labour's long-term plan for a statewide energy infrastructure that employs tens of thousands in the regions and *prints money for Queenslanders*. Work farming? Get ready to have more pests, because the LNP hate science and bioprotection. More drought because they don't believe in climate change mitigation (or just don't care), and think essential public resources like water should belong to whoever can afford to bribe them. And when there are more bushfires and floods, Crisafulli will make you pay for the disaster relief that now costs more because they gutted the authorities that would have prepared us for them. The LNP hate regular people. We're cattle to them. They care about what they can extract from you, that's it.
38. Like the silly Liberals calling themselves liberal.
39. It's actually Latin spelling
40. Especially with the preferential voting system we have! Even if you vote greens or an independent 1, if they don't win your vote can still go to your preference between Labor and Liberal.
41. Because realistically it’s either going to be the ALP or the LNP forming government this time around, and probably the next time too. The only party that might disrupt that dynamic are the Greens, and they’re still not achieving critical mass because for every good policy they have, they do something that puts off most of the electorate. Independents are fine, vote for them if you wish - but lots of them are almost single-issue focused and a coalition of independents will inevitably form a party to hold power.
42. ALP can get away with does less good, because LNP is so bad. I would love to have a strong LNP with credible alternative policies, to keep labor on its toe. I shouldn't have to choose between poor public transport outside Brisbane and religious nuts.
43. In that case you'll need to think how to number rest of the boxes carefully, because your vote will go to the first viable option down the list, if the smaller parties and independents don't get over the line.
44. Could you explain how you think I'm not?
45. This. And say what you want about Miles but most politicians are too scared to rock the boat too much as it often doesn't bode well for them (see carbon tax). Whether you agree with him or not, you don't see this leadership style in the majors very often.
46. The Labor party is always compromised, occasionally incompetent, and perpetually disappointing to it's true believers. The modern Liberal party exists to transfer public money into private hands. To ensure that the poors don't get more than they deserve, and to ensure that the scrabbling masses remain right where they are. There is a vast difference. If you are a wagey, or on benefits, a student or a woman don't vote Liberal/LNP. They will screw you so hard.
47. When ever I hear 'both parties are shit' (out in the real world not on reddit) i can pretty much always guarantee that person is voting conservative. Just a little hypothesis I've been working on, still yet to find an exception to the rule. Maybe its just the people I'm around.
48. But both of the biggest parties ARE shit. There's nothing cynical about it, there are literally dozens of examples of even the better of the two being absolute fucking garbage. The difference is just the degree. Labor is absolutely shit... and LNP is 100% worse. **But being better than the worst does not make a party 'good'.** The Greens and sane independents are the only responsible first preference choices for policies which put people first and don't doom us to environmental apocalypse while siphoning public money into well-connected private purses. And that's fine to point out and doesn't 'split the vote' and all the other deceitful scumfuck desperate bullshit the ALP imports from America to try to pretend they deserve progressive votes, because we have preferential voting in this country so people can - and *should -* vote for the best candidates first, and preference 'the lesser evil' after them. There are left and right factions within the ALP and the left factions need the evidence that comes from ALP losing seats to progressives who give a shit about people like the Greens do to convince the rest of the party that more voters want progress, not to regress. There's zero signs they need to pull their fucking fingers out if they can succeed on first preference from ignorant voters who think they only have two options.
49. Isn't labour just as corrupt and petty but they're more on the side of the average Joe than business? Or is that wrong?
50. True? I thought there was only a small margin of women in power that backed them on this particular topic. But the cherry on top is that they just say no you can't and then don't help wirh the aftermath
51. Crumb maidens.
52. Are you actually trying to wind people up or this the first time you've been on the internet? Edit: if you're actually don't know I apologise but it's fucking everywhere I just assume you were winding people up
53. The right to choose whether or not you stay pregnant. Abortion has come up again as a possible ‘conscience’ vote in the future…there has been lots of discussion on it in this sub
54. KAP have announced they WILL bring a bill in the next parliament to ban abortion. The LNP leader has been very coy about whether the party has a position or if they will allow a conscience vote as they did in 2018 which resulted in almost all LNP members wanted to keep it illegal.
55. I haven't even been able to find out what an "adult" crime is. Are we going to be easier on someone for robbing a toy store than a bottle shop?
56. The word “Food” symbolises in the context of this topic more than literal Edible food Food, Education, Community, Upbringing, Family, Role models, Stability, Opportunity etc. The fabric of a well-rounded human being.
57. He talks out of both sides of his mouth about the housing crisis, that's for sure. And there's been some under rug sweeping about his time as a police officer, definitely.
58. When you read the OP's comments though, that wasn't the intent. They wanted their opinions validated. Its disingenuous intrigue.
59. I'm confused as to why I'm getting downvoted for that comment, lol. People love to call Reddit an echo chamber, like its not blatantly obvious. We are all verrrryyyyy aware there aren't many people here who will sing his praises. If you want to find pro LNP rhetoric, Facebook is a great start. Or Crusifulli's tiktok and look for the profile names with Aussie flags.
60. Exactly what I'm after, it's good to hear informed replies to help me understand what I'm missing which I feel I've gotten some good replies from some of the people that would vote for certain policies but have changed because they strongly disagree with one thing I particular. If someone gave me hard facts that lnp were actually the good guys I'd listen but till then..
61. Absolutely. You know what. The state machine will keep running and the streets won't burn to the ground whichever party gets in. BUT, the policies, overall, of the current LNP candidacy mostly appear to be punitive and the ALP progressive. I still haven't heard a single positive and forward thinking growth policy out the LNP or any of its supporters. Not a single one.
62. Labor now favourites to win as of today 🤷‍♂️
63. No but the answer can be that some rich cunts muddy the waters intentionally for personal gain.
64. It's not though according to every metric we have available, and the LNP claims have been unamimously debunked by almost every expert there is. Do you have any evidence to back up your claims about the police pressuring individuals to drop cases? In 2022 QLD hit the lowest youth crime rates in recorded history and haven't really moved since. There ARE specific crime rates that are going up - DV and sexual assault. This is likely to be from an increase in reporting (a good thing!), but nothing to do with youth crime. While there are some small localised increases in youth crime (which are directly correlated with lower socioeconomic regions, less opportunities for diversionary programs/after school programs/similar, higher rates of alcoholism/family violence, etc), the LNP's plans don't address a single causal issue, and we know from hundreds of years of policing data that it's only going to make things worse in these areas. We -know- that more harshly policing youth is a direct cause of future offending. The only reason it's an 'issue' is because we have a media ecosystem, almost entirely LNP-aligned, who decided spread a nonexistent issue for political opportunism. There's a reason there's a direct crossover between who is spreading/repeating a lot of the bullshit at the top level, and those who are mad about stuff like, for example, a very minor tax for extractive industries. Down from this, these issues are then spread by social media pages creating boomer bait rageposts, and advocating for stuff like the community 'taking matters into their own hands'. The language used by these groups is then repeated by the LNP (such as referring to these kids as 'untouchables'; just racist dogwhistling). This is something that has been happening since the invention of policing; you can find the exact same things being said by the exact same types of people going back hundreds of years.
65. Amanda Stoker might be your answer for the rogue ultra conservative MP given she wins oodgeroo (she will)
66. Hang on. You've just said that they don't have any policies. But then you've criticised their policies. So which is it? Just because you don't like their policies doesn't mean they haven't got any.
67. Shit man are you ok? do you need a hug or something, that's kinda fucked
68. RIP your liver
69. That's basically Reddit as a whole
70. Just enjoy the democratic process and get off your high horse. There is 36 hours left, and us progressive Redditors are really just preaching to the choir - the odds are (literally) that LNP is going to win, and you’ll be happy.
71. Here, let me google that for you: [https://www.smh.com.au/federal-election-2019/exploding-the-myth-of-the-coalition-as-a-sound-economic-manager-20190509-p51lk2.html](https://www.smh.com.au/federal-election-2019/exploding-the-myth-of-the-coalition-as-a-sound-economic-manager-20190509-p51lk2.html)
72. Yep stoker will get in, she's running for the seat based in Cleveland which hasn't gone red since I've been alive. She got parachuted into pretty much the safest seat possible and I wouldn't be shocked to see her be in the cabinet straight up. Edit to correct: her seat hasn't been won by the ALP since 2006 so not quite before I was alive but a very long time ago
73. Well I think firstly not having 50c transport and school lunches for all is a given - I would hope if they do look at both of these they make them much more small target, for example, cheaper transport for pensioners and school kids, and lunches for schools in lower socioeconomic areas or lunch vouchers for specific kids. That’s more likely under the LNP, but obviously there is a risk that there’s none. You know that the LNP will kowtow to the more militant elements of the union movement less, so you should see a reigning in of some of the less reasonable union activity - Miles is a union man through and through and seems to just do what they say. With the crime thing, there is no doubt you’re going to see harsher treatment under the LNP. Now one thing that might work in everyone’s favour is that the LNP got slugged last time when they went way to far, so they might be more cautious in what they put in place this time, but I’m under no illusions that they’ll take a ‘punishment’ stance over a rehabilitation one. Your point is absolutely right, the way to deal with it more longer term is to spend time on the causes, and I have little to no faith the LNP will do that, but I do think they’ll at least put more things in place that will make it less likely that kids will be cruising Brisbane suburbs looking for cars to steal which will mean things like what happened to the Kefu family in Coorparoo will be less likely to happen. You speak to people in those areas and things like car theft and porch pirates sound like they’re happening frequently, and I have more faith that the LNP will reign it in than Labor. The Olympic stadium thing I think is simpler, the LNP literally has to be better than Labor, you would have to work to stuff it up even equally as badly.
74. I’m sorry, but, what? The stat I quoted wasn’t *stop work in qld has gone up relative to last year*, it’s *higher number than other juridictions under similar conditions* That, on the face of it, is *relatively* bad and in no way just “higher number bad”. Of course it is bad when you have been the union affiliated party in government for 8 years when the union has such little confidence the government will come to the table to solve its problems it has to strike all the time. How could the union being so unhappy with the legislative and regulatory environment after 8 years of a one house government to the tune of 4x more than elsewhere *ever* be anything other than bad??? If I had said for example that domestic violence in qld is 4x higher than other states, or crime is 4x higher than in other states (neither are the case, they are just straw man examples), would you give me a “that stat doesn’t mean anything” retort too, or is it only because you didn’t like the stat that you responded like this - genuine food for thought
75. Depending on the seat, One Nation will likely grab some rural seats so voting this way would help that along... if everyone votes the way you're suggesting it also wouldn't reach the major parties. Just do some research and vote on your preference but blindly dropping votes into the racism and fundamentalist parties is a wild way to go
76. That would not bother me at all. Qld being so decentralised has been a bad outcome for SEQ.
77. Let a thousand blossums bloom 🌼 🌸
78. Can we even have early elections any more, with fixed terms?
79. With a greens coalition.
