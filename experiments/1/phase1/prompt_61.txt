Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. I don’t care about it. Things will be 3% different for most people. It’s not like we are all being carted off to a concentration camp. The way some people carry on is ridiculous.
2. Assuming you voted for the Greens? who support Hezbollah, pretty disturbing as well
3. The only thing disturbing is your lack of deodorant
4. Their economic policies are sound eh. Freeze rents, guarantee renewals, cap grocery prices, provide and pay for breakfast and lunch at schools… They seems to have forgotten how a free market economy works (and they are blithely ignoring what happens when you kill off the ‘free market’ part), and, they also seem to have forgotten that you need to, you know, pay for stuff that you as a government provide.
5. Says the civil servant. Mate nice try but policy is directed by politicians. Civil servants are their lackies. I work with governments. The Minister is their master.
6. Get out of the city brosef. The smog is clogging your mind's grip on reality. "Quick get me my alfoil hat and a latte, the farmers are coming for me!!! Ahhhh!!! I can smell their evil on the wind!!! Won't someone call the billionaires, they'll save me!!! "
7. And neo liberals love to gut public services. Medicare is socialised healthcare by definition. When you use the words "public service" you essential define a socialist service. It is a proud Australian facet that I'm sure most of us champion
8. educate yourself and read some Marx and Engels bud
9. And a democracy has a right to self defence and that's why they lost my vote
10. Once you see the bigotry and authoritarianism on the left, it does shake you
11. Given the course on crime and economy I choose economy, wished Labor won but greens has to be last with their proposals
12. 9.8% of a state of millions is not a small number. Why shouldn’t they have a say on policy? Hard to see how that is anti-democratic if a majority government of less than 50% of the total votes is fine. But also - government should reflect the will of the voters. If voters refuse to grant a majority to a party, they don’t get a majority government and there can be a contest for the balance of power. It’s exactly how democracy works.
13. If something fails to pass parliament because 43 LNP politicians and 1 Green politician votes against it, it's solely the 1 Green politician's fault? That's some wild logic.
14. the last time we had a hung parliament was the most successful period in Australian history https://australiainstitute.org.au/post/what-happens-when-independents-hold-the-balance-of-power/
15. The relocation of the school is inevitable. The facility can no longer cater to the modern education of primary school students especially in sports, is surrounded by 3 major thoroughfares, has no pick up or drop of zones and the building is past its used by date. To keep fighting for an unwinnable cause is simply a waste of time, because sooner or later a viable solution has to be found.
16. Most people I know who vote Green preference labor second with the intent to try to push labor left of centre.
17. have a look at the greens voting card next time
18. Am ALP member in a safe ALP seat, I voted 1 greens, 2 weed and 3 ALP because when the preferences get reviewed it informs future policy decisions to remain left or move further left to try and recapture those first preferences. I find it utterly hilarious how terrified ALP is of the greens, at branch meetings and at convention they carry on more about the greens than LNP
19. Last federal election Labor got a relatively low primary vote despite winning government which suggests that they're not people's first choice. As a greens voter part of my vote is about pushing Labor to the left. If Labor look at their preference flows and see greens votes getting them over the line they might go OK we need to speak to these voters. I feel like Miles understood this and put out policies to keep the city seats - it worked for them. You can see their primary vote is quite strong. I love that preferential voting let's you communicate so much with your vote tbh.
20. It's insane how hard preference voting is for people to understand.
21. He has too many millions of dollars and properties to be seen as a champion of the people these days. Smart guy though. Did some good things.
22. Israel has just proved that up to the point of the terror attacks last year they were being restrained, now they have had enough and are showing what they could have done but never did all those years. If the Palestinians could do what Israel is doing now they would have done it first chance they got. The left leaning people are literally the epitome of the frog and the scorpion fable, the Palestinians literally support none of your causes they would kill all the gays and trans, have zero advocation for women’s rights have the complete opposite views on everything you stand for, you’re the frog carrying the scorpion across the river…
23. QLD state politics is not the place for it. Move on
24. Before we go any further, I voted #1 for the greens. We're almost certainly on the same side where we want the Greens to have more power in the government and I feel you're using pretty combative language which isn't going to help convince anyone. With that said. >It's not a state issue I stand by this. It's a federal issue because states are not the level of government that deal with international relations. The federal Greens members can care for this kind of stuff. They have the exact same constituents as the local members. Direct your effort appropriately. >Can you show a single Greens candidate who made this their primary platform position They don't need to make it Primary, they need to not give the media any soundbites that allows them to run with negative greens stories. It's the reality of being a part of a party that has the media landscape already set against you. Take [this story](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-04/brisbane-councillor-trina-massey-refund-newsletter-gaza/104304744) from the local election as an example of how their strategy can backfire. Nobody thinks the Greens are for genocide, they don't need to keep mentioning it. >Damn, if only literally every Greens candidate -did- have this as their primary talking point, Correct, and this is where the Greens need to really hammer home their strengths. Unfortunately they're complex issues and the Greens spend a lot of effort trying to explain their complex solutions. They do a lot of stuff like door knocking, which is great if you're only trying to win a few select seats. But if they want to grow, they need their messaging strategies to grow too. Let's take the LNP "Adult Crime Adult Time". A simple message that is easy to remember, but it doesn't really explain much. So if you are interested in more, you look it up. Otherwise, you just take it at face value and move on. The Greens could've tried running a message like "Crime Prevention, not Crime Reaction" to get people interested in what that means, and then had easily available resources to explain it. If the Greens focused on making simpler messaging, then I believe they'd have a much more successful time in growing their vote.
25. Lol, oh yeah and what could little old Australia do on the world stage of what's happening? "Stop! Or I'll say stop again!... I warn ya!". We can't do shit and are completely under the rule of whatever America is doing, it's as simple as that.
26. >Uhh, so you just have 0 idea on the Greens positions or policies then? Because this is literally a key part of their platform. If that is true, then clearly the Greens didn't do a good enough job at getting their message across.
27. > You still need to gather numbers for how many and where people are using the system so you can allocate resources effectively. Ok, and? People could still just tap their go card but have nil charge, this is a literal non-existent problem/justification.
28. So because of the behaviour of an almost negligible minority you think we shouldn't push for free public transport? Logic like that it's no wonder the LNP won.
29. Ok, so nothing about the valuation then?
30. I have no idea what you are referencing
31. A free market economy is never meant to be run laissez-faire my guy. During times of economic crisis where the market has failed, you absolutely intervene with hard controls to support people. Also, in times of crisis you borrow and run into deficit to support the populace. We've had 3 years of consistent surplus, we're fine.
32. Neither are relevant a hundred years later WW2 for all it's horror gave us universal healthcare, nothing to do with socialism
33. That’s fine. You have the right to vote how you wish, my point was just that it’s dangerous to call criticism of Israel antisemitism. Government should be held to account.
34. Which proposals are so terrible? Free public transport? 🤔
35. 9.8% is not a majority. Simple as that. You may not like it but that is the numbers game. The will of the voters should not sit with a minority party who represent a small percentage of the population. That is exactly against democracy. Democracy is everyone gets a say, the majority rule. Not everyone gets a say and... Because the it's a tie, the party with the least votes decides. Reality is a numbers game. That's why the Greens failed, as they should.
36. Independents!!!! Not the Greens!!!!
37. Agree. If it hadn’t been used as a political wedge issue the greens would be screaming for a school with more green space away from major roads.
38. he had that when he was elected lol ?
39. Like decommission the rural Queensland rail network?
40. Exactly! It has absolutely nothing to do with it at all.
41. People refusing to actually read up and learn about political parties is their failing, what was the LNP's messaging and why was it so successful then?
42. Pretty much all Government decision-making is based on "how will bogans abuse this?", which is why we can't have nice things as a society anymore.
43. It's why low fare is a good idea and free is a bad idea. But don't worry, Green supporters invoking logic will never fail to amuse.
44. Your animal instinct
45. Net debt of $25b and you’re out here pointing at a couple of tiny, manufactured “operating surpluses” wanting to spend piles more. Ok m8
46. lmao, this is why you need to read Das Kapital
47. It's not dangerous when it's true
48. Destroying the banking system, collapsing our industries, unchecked migration policies, policies that will dig us deeper into debt than the other parties, blocking housing developments. Lots to list but then again it wouldn't matter because it won't change your opinions about the greens and I won't either. I'll just vote the way I want to
49. 40% also isn’t a majority - no party has a majority in the primary votes. I’m not saying 9.8% should have a mandate, but neither should a government that isn’t given a majority by the people. It’s why we have minor parties, to negotiate and compromise and be more democratic. Flawed system though, but not for the reasons you mention. 9.8% having no say in parliament except in where their preferences flow to may not be an ideal system.
50. now I know you only read headlines. good night!
51. His wife did. He was just a poor boy from Nambour.
52. >People refusing to actually read up and learn about political parties is their failing Lol, seriously, it's the audience's fault the message wasn't conveyed adequately?
53. I still have no idea what you are on about. You might want to get some help.
54. AA+ credit rating. We're fine.
55. Prefer the Doug Anthony Allstars version
56. And we’re back to the start. Show me the antisemitism? Do you even know what that word means?
57. And you've read the specific policy documents and researched it all yeah?
58. I lived that election champ. Ain't no Greens involved. The Greens are a weed to Australian politics. They stand for nothing so do not deserve the balance of power if it were to occur. Their low primary vote is 2% above One Nation so are in the same "loopy extremist" basket to the majority.
59. thats not how marriage works lol
60. This is going to shock you, but conveying the entirety of an entire platform of policies is literally impossible if your policies have anything approaching substance to them, yes. But please answer my question, what was the LNP's messaging and why do you think it was so succesful?
61. Pointless game to play, don't try and pretend to be passive. You attacked first claiming my vote was disturbing. Get bent hippy.
62. Maybe you missed this. [https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/election-giveaways-put-queensland-s-credit-rating-at-risk-20241014-p5ki25](https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/election-giveaways-put-queensland-s-credit-rating-at-risk-20241014-p5ki25)
63. which is why no one will ever take you seriously not my fault if you refuse to understand the basic principles of free market economy & government assistance
64. If you don't agree with the IDF atrocities you are anti semitic. /s
65. Are they protesting Turkey bombing the Kurds, Assad bombing his own people, the war in Ukraine, Sudan. No? That's the anti semitism.
66. Thanks Bob. Let me know how to subscribe to your newsletter you clown.
67. >This is going to shock you, but conveying the entirety of an entire platform of policies is literally impossible This is going to shock you, but it's not necessary to convey the entirety of an entire (sic) platform, a broad understanding would suffice. This is a failure of the party not the voters. >But please answer my question, what was the LNP's messaging and why do you think it was so succesful? You keep trying to change the subject, I can only assume you're trying to paint me as an LNP voter who only did so out blindly out of loyalty or "time for a change" mentality. Who I voted for is irrelevant, both to your argument and to our system of voter anonymity. Suffice it to say I have no party allegiance, and the only options in my electorate were ALP, LNP, One Nation, Greens and Family First. None of whom I would urinate on if they were burning.
68. Hippy 😂😂😂 you don’t even know who I voted for. Ok. I think all this is done has highlighted your anger issues, and what you think of…I assume green voters?
69. Oh no, we downgrade from a AA+ credit rating to an AA rating. The horror.
70. You're confusing me with someone who politics affects
71. Unfortunately this is exactly how that argument is going. It’s wild. Imagine being called anti-Slavic for criticising Putin.
72. Since you asked, yes they have. Are they doing it right now, no because the most pressing issue is the nation that Israel is erasing. You know this to be true and that’s why you’re arguing in bad faith. If you actually supported the government’s actions you wouldn’t need to paint it as antisemitism.
73. It’s actually wild that you claim to be a green supporter but until recently and somehow think this party is racist. I bet you’ve never voted green in your life.
74. > This is going to shock you, but it's not necessary to convey the entirety of an entire (sic) platform, a broad understanding would suffice. This is a failure of the party not the voters. Which they absolutely did, I'm not sure what you think they didn't convey. > You keep trying to change the subject, I can only assume you're trying to paint me as an LNP voter who only did so out blindly out of loyalty or "time for a change" mentality. Who I voted for is irrelevant, both to your argument and to our system of voter anonymity. Suffice it to say I have no party allegiance, and the only options in my electorate were ALP, LNP, One Nation, Greens and Family First. None of whom I would urinate on if they were burning. It's entirely on subject, you claimed the Greens failed because of poor messaging, the easy inference is that the LNP succeeded because of good messaging, I never made any claims who you voted for, that's your persecution complex coming through.
75. I assume you haven't read all the parties policies. If you had, you'd see that the independents or minor parties I've voted for have clear economic and intuitive plans to the issues we are facing. We have to vote based on policy, not on emotion and what feels good. It's great to back a cause, but if they don't have a proper plan they can't be successful. That's the issue with the greens and the animal justice party. They don't have good policy decisions in place. They'd run this country into the ground. Not to mention, if I don't vote your way, I'm the enemy. That's the issue with you, you don't want democracy, you want your way. Democracy is about this sort of arguing to come to a conclusion. But you are like the MAGAs but on the opposite spectrum. Everything must be wrong if it's nit your side.
76. You were the one who sought to justify your position by referencing the current rating, hoss.
77. on the low end of the scale, it is affecting you right now by engaging in this very conversation
78. That's OK. I still regret it though.
79. You still don’t know who I voted for 😭😭😭 But good on you for not asking. I assume you just figured I voted Greens. I don’t tell anyone how I vote, but I’m finding your defensiveness interesting. Also the over-explaining, of how I should have looked into who I was voting for. Ta.
80. Over state politics? Hardly
81. You've voted your way, but to you my way is morally wrong for whatever reason. You also don't have the balls to state who you voted for. So Labor I guess.
82. Are you not engaging in this conversation? it might only be a few seconds to comment, but take into account how many comments we have had with each other, it kinda adds up even while we do other things in between. I did say it was at the low end of the scale, so maybe it's been enough time to take a shower? Actively listen to a song we enjoy? There's plenty of little activities we otherwise could do, yet we are still in a conversation of political discourse
83. You voted one nation. That’s indefensible.
84. I'm also engaging in the NZ test cricket as well as the rugby from last night All while doing some art I'm an a renaissance man if you will
85. Extremely defensible, they have good policies all around. Can't base a party on Pauline Hanson. She may be hard on the nose, but right or wrong, she does actually care about this country. That's more than can be said about most politicians. They're here to further themselves, not the country. Harden up princess.
86. Great! they're productive and I'm sure positive for you - I absolutely support that. I'm not sure if you're deliberately ignoring the point I'm making, but I will not press further as I don't think it is constructive for either of us anymore. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
87. Ok boomer
88. I'm 29 dumbass
89. Tell that to your attitude 🤭
90. Go feed your shrimp
91. lol stalker
92. It's one click, click on mine.
93. No thanks, have better things to do. Tv, wine, scrolling. Don’t want to see your history.
94. Mate, looks me to be the only things you have are you and your bettas. I'm up now because I'm a shift worker. You'd be up because you have nothing else. Go vote however you feel. Don't degrade our democracy because people feel differently to you. When you ask who someone voted for, have the balls to state who you voted for. You don't have to ask about bettas, they're actually quite hardy. Just make sure they don't get too hot over the summer period.
95. They actually aren’t that hardy, they require a fair bit of care. But Alfie is fine, thanks for asking? Again, the stalking is fucking weird and a deflection from being challenged on voting for a party who are abysmal on a very basic level. So of course someone who openly votes for them would go to my posts and make of me for having……fish? And….caring for them? Many people do shift work. Make sure you take care of yourself. It shortens your life.
96. Hahaha, your fish are as soft as you are. Mine are thriving thanks to me only changing the water every other month. Less is more with them. Snails just won't stop breeding, have to sell a few, you need some?
97. https://preview.redd.it/f61jd2w3o4xd1.jpeg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=615b542d5a797520ada41a1831bcb3d78ffdc2f2 Seriously, I need to offload some snails.
98. You shouldn’t have that many snails in that size tank, but I guess that’s why you are trying to sell them?? I already have a snail in each tank thank you. Looks like you need to reach out to a LFS but oh, they sell them for about $1 so they probably won’t want them either. Bad husbandry to let overbreeding happen.
99. These raunchy bastards have done it on their own. Isn't enough of a market on gumtree to offload them, hahaha. I'll give them to petbarn if I can't rehome them. As I said, living conditions are too good. I only have one tank.
100. That’s why you don’t have multiples? Unless you are planning to breed. And you are lecturing me on betta upkeep 😂😂😭😭 ok. I think we are done here.
101. Mate I'm lecturing you on keeping an ecosystem. They're breeding due to an abundance of resources. They are living fine due to an abundance of them too. I'll get rid of them before it becomes an issue. My tank is healthy, the fish are fine, so are the snails. Kids are happy with it too. Don't take such a serious outlook on your fish as well as your politics. The things will run smoothly.
102. I enjoyed this haha
103. I know right, absolutely random! Love it!
104. Allegedly 50c fares are staying. Expect lots of cuts to public services and jobs, and lowering royalties on resources. I also think they're canning the extension of the rail to Coolangatta? Things like that.
105. Unfortunately their actual plan is pretty unclear and vague. Abortion sounded like it was going to be an issue. But I'd have some confidence that they won't dare touch it after the Labor campaign forced them to change from dodging the question to clearly stating the laws won't change. I was worried for a bit there that they'd be in a minority government and need Katters for support, which could have pushed the issue. But I think it's relatively safe. It would look really terrible for them to change those laws. 50c fares should stay. At least for now. This is something that might be worth people writing to their new MP about. But I wouldn't be surprised to see it go in their first budget. It does seem generally quite popular though, and in the interests of not tanking their popularity in the first budget, maybe they'll stay. Who knows what's happening with the Olympics. Their plan is to come up with a plan with no extra money invested. So we shall see. It sounds like they're already back flipping on nuclear power in Queensland. Crisafuli had previously said there would be no nuclear in Queensland. Now the party line is more "nuclear agnostic" the vague "not part of our plan" and its a "federal issue". I think they're waiting for Dutton to win federally and they will flip on this and we will see nuclear being built in Queensland at the expense of other green energy projects. We shall see. They're scrapping some big hydro power projects which is a shame. They're likely scrapping the coal royalties which will mean a big chunk taken out of the budget and cuts to cost of living relief. At the moment they're talking more money for health, not cuts. So we shall see what happens there. Best of luck to them and I hope they do a good job.
106. Google "Campbell Newman cuts." 🥺
107. Cuts to public services. Attacks on reproductive rights. Transfer of public money to private hands. The usual LNP stuff.
108. I'm going to have to find a new job, because there's no way that Stoker's DJAG is going to renew my funding.
109. If you own a coal mine or massive business it’s good for you. If you’re a normal person you’ll lose a lot
110. If it was good for the people, expect to see it gutted. Last time they fired 14000 public servants, this time the goal is to try to do enough damage that Labor won't be able to fix it, as was part of the goal last time.
111. They promised to keep 50 cent fares, though I wouldn’t be surprised if they cancel that given their record of bashing it until the moment Labor promised to make them permanent. Public services will suffer, that’s a given. On the other hand, I do not see how these guys would be very popular up til the next election. They campaigned on nothing but cheap slogans and getting rid of mining royalties. They’ve got nothing going for them besides crime (and even then their plans are questionable) and the fact that they’ve been out for nine years. They’ll be a useless government at best, or it’ll be Campbell Newman 2.0.
