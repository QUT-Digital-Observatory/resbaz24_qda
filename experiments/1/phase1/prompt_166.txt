Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. "You say people don't fall for MSM, but you've apparently fallen for the attacks on Max hook, line and sinker.". I haven't "fallen". I have seen him in action. He is completely out of his depth, barely competent, in my judgement. He has terrible policies which he can't explain convincingly. In my judgement. I don't know to what extent he is responsible for the policy debacle or the political strategy debacle. I assume quite a bit. Bandt is the leader and it's time for a change in direction. To be clear, my opinion is based on the primary source, him. Am I surprised that thoughtful expert political commentators come to the same conclusions? No, not at all. Am I surprised that so many former Greens voters have come to these conclusions? Yes, a bit. But I am happy. Greens voters are supposed to be highly educated, after all. They are supposed to take an evidence-based view and respect expert opinion. None of that is favourable to the Green policies on housing, which are in economic terms an absolute joke, flat earth economics. The Greens embarked on a much more detailed housing policy built on fallacies and nonesense during this federal term. They obviously got tremendously excited at the results in Brisbane at the last Federal election and thought they had discovered the magical formula: extreme housing populism. They have bet the house on it. In fact, they are betting their House seats on it. They sail on to doom it seems. Ha ha. The huge change this term is that they have made it the central defining position. They have used it to obstruct ALP legislation, they have used it to elevate MCM into the star who is everywhere (CFMEU rallies?), they have used it at state and national level. And everywhere they do, they lose votes, in the middle of a housing crisis. According to opinion polls, even the LNP has more credibility on housing, which must be a microphone-dropping moment. It is hard to find any serious person who is disputing that the Greens have pivoted to a party of housing populism, and that it is failing. But if you think that is wrong, how do you explain what's going on? As to recommendations, if the Greens want to do one loud issue, it should only be talking about nuclear power and renewables transition. People are suspicious of nuclear power on environmental grounds, and they should be very skeptical on economics. So it is politically fertile ground. And it is on brand. There is a Greens echo chamber, but the average voter is confused as heck to hear the Greens go on on and on about social housing. I suspect this is why more focused parties such as AJP and the Teals are politically speaking eating the Greens lunch. It was the AJP who went on the warpath over duck shooting in Victoria. Why not the Greens? Where are the Greens? The Greens are on the stage with the CFMEU, a militant movement with a pretty hostile and uber-male reputation. The Greens are lost. They suck at progressive politics. Look at the referendum. You know those memes "You had only one job". Oh my god, what an absolute balls-up Thorpe was. Thanks for that. They suck at it because it is a party divided. The traditional feminists hate the trans activists. Half the party wants to ban immigration and isn't allowed to talk about it. They wish for Muslim votes but despise religion. I have opinions on all of those topics, but there's only one of me. The Greens just have to make some of this out of scope. Also while (stopping) nuclear power is powerful political opportunity, it also really matters. We need all hands on deck.
2. It means that Monster Energy Drink run barter town.
3. I hope you have the same rights as the rest of us to touch grass, one day.
4. LOL You have the burden of proof, because the Greens got zero seats and the complaints of actual voters are here all through this thread. What I'm saying is why on earth do I have to satisfy you that I'm correct when you can just change the goalposts because you're going to disagree anyway?
5. And the burden of proof for the assertions made in that link are where? Circular reasoning. I contend that X is true. You contend it isn't. You insist that I provide proof, but you don't have to. I contend you burden of proff fallacy is garbage. Prove to me it isn't.
6. I was told there would be no math üòÇ
7. He is right about preferential voting though. Ironically, people need to think less about this. Just list the parties you like most to least and the system sorts it out.
8. Dude is literally trying to help you understand a fundamental part of our democracy that you obviously didn't understand. They are doing that despite the fact they fundamentally disagree with your political views and yet, you still try to act the person? How bout this way. The greens get funding per 1 preference vote they get. You have cost your political part money by putting labour 1 and greens 2. Despite the fact the putting greens 1 and labour 2 would've resulted in the same party being preferenced by you.
9. ‚Äòrein‚Äô them in as ‚Äòreins of a horse‚Äô (not ‚Äòreign‚Äô ‚Äî that‚Äôs what a monarch does) ü´∂üèº
10. So we conclude that a lot less people care about social justice since about the time the Greens started going Trotsky on housing?
11. What's with all the double-speak? Just say it.
12. I'm genuinely curious. Is there one or more specific Greens policies you object to? Here's their platform for Queensland: https://greens.org.au/qld/plan
13. Bros like the real life akchually meme theres nothing you can say that will satisfy him the fact everyone voted them out should be enough to indicate theres a major issue but hey im just a working joe so what do i know üòÇ
14. I know it's like talking to a robot. IF the Greens were not TOO EXTREME, they would not have lost seats and would convert many ALP seats into GRN seats. I don't know what Old Mate Emu wants, a Wikipedia article written by British Army Propaganda Units (77th Brigade) saying how the Greens are too extreme? How is that any kind of proof? Here's a simple one: cowering in the corner over climate change whilst refusing to discuss nuclear power. Also the precautionary principle is abused to a psychotic level. Furthermore: a common complaint made here is that when Bob Brown was unceremoniously punted, the Greens turned red. Well they had Lee Rhiannon who was overly unpatriotic in the 1980s and too Breznehev curious. What Australian wants development of anything blocked, no viable way to get reasonably priced electricity and mitigate climate change and USSR loving dinosaurs? \*Where's your peer reviewed article proving this? All of your logical fallacies so far have shown i that the Greens are not extreme enough!\* So where are their seats in the QLD Parliament? They're on the nose lil' bud. They will likely lose Senators at the next Federal election if their polling does not improve.
15. Nah. I know how to vote I know how the funding works.. He's only seeing LNP as capable of getting 50% in his logic and being a sanctimonious dick in the process.
16. That‚Äôs funny. The Greens actually went full ‚ÄúMenzies‚Äù on housing.
17. I can't dumb it down for you anymore.
18. Being against nuclear power is scientifically illiterate. Oh and communism.
19. Is there anything specific in the Greens policy platform, published on their website, that you object to?
20. How do you figure? Menzies believed in establishing private ownership (to the point of suppressing state owned housing) because like all sensible conservatives, he saw that people with a house would become solid citizens (his type of people). Thatcher was the same. The petite bourgeoisie. They were his forgotten people. These were two serious leaders with a genuine grip on middle class conservatism, and of course the political success to prove they were right. I don't think any of that is true of the Greens. The most definitive statement of the Green's policy is the Max C-M NPC launch which is on Youtube including a transcript. He spoke after an expert on housing. In my opinion the policy is ridiculous, founded on the straw man of the "developer monopoly" and rich on conspiracy theory tropes that mark it is as genuinely peasants with pitchforks populism. It was the least convincing NPC speech I have ever heard. It was like watching a Year 9 presentation from an earnest but middle of the class student. Anyway, that is my subjective opinion. The Greens have to find a new job for him, he is the greatest political disaster since Thorpe. At least she's good fun. Maybe he'll simply lose his seat in a few months and that will be that. The policy contains a lot of detail, but it is not fundamentally about people buying their own house. It is primarily about a vast, absolutely unprecedented role for state owned housing funded by extraordinary levels of tax increase, the eviction of private sector rental housing, and a redefinition of private housing to be basically leases on housing with substantial state equity (obviously an echo of Singapore HDB). To portray any of this as Menzian would horrify both parties, in my opinion. As to the Greens, who never stopped telling us to look at the evidence on climate change (and rightly so), they need to be a bit more evidence-based. They have a few months to figure it out. Rents are starting to fall, they are at serious risk of being stranded by a changing tide, if that hasn't happened already. I so despise their pathetic efforts on housing I think they deserve it. Low effort, idiotic policy deserves to be punished, if there is any karma in politics.
21. I think you've gone a bit too far with the dumbing down.
22. You must not be very bright then. Why not make a specific claim that can be discussed, rather than speaking in obscure riddles? You seem to be claiming there's some sort of conspiracy involving the government and the ABC, and some obscure third party. Who is Monster Energy in this metaphor? And what the hell is barter town?
23. Menzies built lots of public housing. And home ownership had never been higher.
24. Would you vote for Master Blaster if he promised to get the Bruce highway up to a standard that would put the speed limit up to 110kph?
25. "In 1956, the Liberal-Country Coalition Prime Minister Robert Menzies renegotiated the 1945 CSHA, sounding the death knell to the golden age of public housing in Australia." [https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=menzies+and+public+housing](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=menzies+and+public+housing) (my search) and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public\_housing\_in\_Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_housing_in_Australia) (a good result) Home ownership peaked in 1967 at 74% according to ABS figures, the year after Menzies left office. He executed his plan of higher private ownership very well. He did that by selling a huge amount of public housing.
26. And the Greens policy is to build a shit ton of public housing to rent or buy. So that seems like it would work!
27. Except for the bit about the people with the money not wanting to pay for it and the bit about the renters not wanting to live in it.
28. Still. Closer to Menzies than Trotsky!
29. Yes, Trotsky was a bit over the top.
30. We vote every 4 years, that's how our democracy works at a state level
31. No. We have fixed terms now. The only reason the Governor can be asked to dissolve Parliament for an early election is if neither party can form a majority.
32. I wish we could have recall elections like the US has at the state level.
33. It‚Äôs okay he‚Äôs committed to resign when he doesn‚Äôt reduce crime. Which of course being the honest person (that doesn‚Äôt even live in his own electorate) he is, he will honour. At least we get 50c fares (because as an honest man he‚Äôll stick to this too), albeit by losing homelessness services.
34. Like it or not? We live in a democracy. There will be another election in 4 years.
35. Are you suffering from labour withdrawal symptoms?
36. RRrreeeeeeee
37. I wish but unfortunately he looks like he has a strong head of hair
38. In 4 years. You new to politics?
39. Trying to explain that the rules are the rules & the winner is final to a generation that came up on participation awards is tough. They think you can just reload the last save and have another crack until their team wins...
40. Im pretty sure there are avenues to call for an ealry election. Didn't it happen recently at federal level?
41. Have you tried to report a crime through police link? Policelink is reducing reported crime enormously just by making the form unbearable. Make the form easier and crime will jump, make it harder and it will drop.
42. i think people are normally pretty happy after childbirth is over actually
43. Im not a labour voter, i personally hate them they have ruined my life. But I despise LNP slightly more
44. Until he makes decisions that upset everyone. Inevitably haha üòÖ
45. The parliament can call an early election if it loses confidence in the government. But with LNP winning a majority government that's pretty much impossible
46. You're probably referring to a Double Dissolution.
47. Federal parliament doesn't have fixed terms. The Prime Minister can, in theory, advise the Governor-General to dissolve parliament and call a House of Representatives election at any time. The only reason an early election can be called in fixed term states is if neither party can form a majority.
48. This is a great point - let‚Äôs make it happen. Democracy doesn‚Äôt end at voting. Talk your new local member about the challenges with the form. Surely something practical like this can be fixed.
49. OK so "Labour" have ruined your life, but you despise the other party more...what possibly could the LNP have done that's worse than them? I'm intrigued!
50. What have they done that‚Äôs worse than havin your life ruined?
51. The parliament can't call any election. Only the Governor can dissolve parliament and call an election. It's not impossible. 2 or 3 by elections could remove the majority. Even then it would not require an early election if the opposition can win a confidence motion. An early election is only required if neither side can form a majority and win a confidence motion.
52. Ohhh ok, well thanks for the clarification üòÅ
53. I shall devolge no further sir!
54. Not sure what you are trying to correct. If a parliament votes no confidence in the govt then the governor will dissolve it and call an election. That's how the system works
55. Booo
56. Minister for privatisations
57. Taxing Queenslanders more so he can lower tax on the coal companies so he can maintain the budget that Labor set while lining his pockets and he will call it screwing Queenslanders over, *oh wait no we cant that‚Äôll make it too obvious. We‚Äôll call it ‚ÄúSaving Queenslanders Money‚Äù*
58. Department of Prison Services
59. Queensland Hydro is gone under the LNP. No more battery storage using pumped hydro.
60. Three Word Slogan.
61. Minister for the electorate of Gina.
62. Minister for womb retention Minister for sustainable mining profits Minister for youth correction
63. Can't wait to see who the minister for focus groups and shit populist policies will be.
64. The FGD felching Gina division is now at the top of the premiers dept
65. Minister for Developor Donations
66. I know Mike Kaiser has been sacked, but can't find out his replacement (paywall). I was guessing last night that Campbell Newman would be the new DPC Director-General, since he is Cruisafulli's mentor so don't know if that is who it is or someone else.
67. Department of Mining Magnate Wealth Protection Department of Teenage Thief Flogging Department of Female Insignificance
68. Suck a fat one Lefty reddit users.
69. And it won't cost hundreds of thousands like a hospital name change.
70. Yep. And QLD hydro was going to use revenue and funding to support tourism initiatives in the regions to sustain the towns post mining. Watch poverty in the regions increase again
71. Maybe you missed it, but they've expanded to four-word slogans now.
72. stop the... goats?
73. It's David Mackie. Interim role
74. You clearly have no idea how much changing department names costs. I guess you're fine with hospitals being named after racists, though?
75. Maybe they can change it back?
76. *Goatse.
77. The only true answer is to wait and see. And then by time the next election rolls around you‚Äôll be old enough to vote and able to make an informed vote, based on your personal observations. Don‚Äôt let people tell you how to think or what‚Äôs important. Just because something is popular or generally accepted does not make it ‚Äòright‚Äô. Instead, think for yourself and let yourself decide what‚Äôs important and what‚Äôs right. Also don‚Äôt fall for the trap of sticking to one side, it‚Äôs not a football match, you don‚Äôt choose a team and stay loyal to them. Hold shit politicians to account. Be willing to swing in any direction. A lot will change in the next 70 years or however old you‚Äôll get
78. The fact that people are commenting with "dunno, wait and see" is absolutely wild. We should know what policies we're voting for before we get to the booth. Long story short, Crisafulli has officially pledged to remove coal royalties (say goodbye to 50c fares, cheaper electricity and rego), wind back the clock on abortion rights (he refused to answer if he would or would not, but a majority of his members support a conscience vote, so he either supports that majority or they turf him, which he will want to avoid) and he has pledged to remove preferential voting. Even if we can vote them out in the next election, it's going to be tremendously difficult. It's also going to be very rough if you're a healthcare worker. Since the coal royalties are gone, the LNP traditionally cut from the health sector, and Newman famously cut 14,000 healthcare workers in 2013. It will happen again.
79. Go and talk to an older family member that lived through the Newman years.
80. It could just be my skepticism speaking but Newman wanted to privatise the prison system and it wasn‚Äôt profitable enough, so it didn‚Äôt happen. Filling them up with kids might make that a possibility this time around.
81. Hand out fat contracts to their mates. Hope you got cushy with them while they were in opposition
82. The LNP has commited to alot of the same targets/promises that the out going gov have put in place (eg 50cent fares) but the issues as I see are- Coal royalty tax- LNP will lower this and it will leave a sizable hole in the budget. This will likely result in less infrastructure development or bigger state debt. Youth Crime- like whats happening in the NT the new gov will change laws to make detention more likely for youth offenders. They also have promised to build some specialised detention centres to rehabilitate youth offenders. Abortion laws- the Katter party has backed off on their plan to submit a private members bill to re-crimilise abortion but now the gov has changed there is no obstacle to them doing it and LNP have a policy to allow their sitting members to have a conscious vote (so vote how they like and not be forced to vote on party lines). This would be a major mistake if it does get to a vote in parliament. Pissing off 51% of the population will not end well. Climate change- the LNP will likely slow down the push for renewables and approve more mining. Cutting services- Conservative governments generally cut social services and look for savings in Public service. The new premier has said repeatedly they wont cut public service jobs and considering what happened last time they were in gov they would be stupid to do anything to the public service but there are areas they could look at without too much negative press (eg external consultants costs) They will likely do a few other things like changing the political donation rules and getting rid of compulsory preferential voting (so voters can just put a numb 1 on the candidate they want and not give every candidate on the ballot paper a preference number). Personally Im not a fan of any of these potential changes but we are a democracy and the population has changed the gov so it is what it is.
83. Try and find Vote Compass on the ABC website. Answer the questions as well as you can and it will show you where your opinions put you on the spectrum. It will also then show you which party more closely aligns with your views.
84. They will like scrap the coal tax for the mining friends pretty soon, as a result many services will be slashed to raise revenue to pay for other programs that likely also help their mates, have yet to see an lnp government that does not go out of their way to do this
85. Mining company‚Äôs won this election. Don‚Äôt think it was about anything else.
86. I can see them selling off some of the state schools on prime real estate land. Broadbeach on the GC comes to mind and probably some inner city Brisbane locations.
87. If they go draconian and do things like widespread strip searching of children (something that happens in NSW) to show they‚Äôre ‚Äútough on youth crime‚Äù it‚Äôs going to piss a lot of parents off. That said, Queensland is a basket-case when it comes to white-collar jobs outside of the government. Christafulli alluded to attracting businesses to the state, so maybe that will change.
88. Remindme! In 1 year how f***** QLD is under the LNP.
89. The proposed changes to voting will make it harder for minor parties and easier to maintain the status quo. The LNP hate the public service (everything should be run by their private sector mates who will take extra profits for themselves while cutting costs/raising prices) The biggest change we're going to see is how the media report on the government.
90. As a young lad, just list down all the things that these politicians promised to do before being elected and see if they follow through with it. You will realise that no matter what party these politicians are in, they will backtrack on most of their promises, and nothing will change. They will "try" to pass in new policies, but there's a very high chance that it will get rejected, and they will say 'well I tried," and move on. Also, watch how much David is worth now and watch his net worth go up from bribes and dodgy dealings. Peter Dutton is somehow worth over 400 million...
91. Watch the Margaret Atwood LNP documentary, *The Handmaids Tale*. That's what Queensland will look like in four years.
92. They'll sell some assets.
93. The main change that will be very relevant for you is that the LNP wants kids sentenced to adult prison sentences. This is basically what the coalition promised in the NT and they delivered it, they will absolutely do that in Queensland too.
94. Personally, I think the main things the LNP government will do differently are: - Build an Olympic Stadium at either Woolloongabba or Victoria Park, rather than putting up temporary stands at QSAC. - Change the new law allowing 3 drug diversions for possession of ANY illicit drugs (including meth and heroin) before getting charged. - Change the rules around defendants being released on bail and sentenced to ‚Äúsofter‚Äù punishments that don‚Äôt involve jail time. I really think that‚Äôs about it. Their margin is so razor thin they know they‚Äôre on thin ice. Qld has picked the LNP for a ‚Äútrial period‚Äù so there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôll go all out - they know they‚Äôll be punished the next election if they do. They‚Äôll have learnt from Campbell Newman‚Äôs mistakes. In fact, I‚Äôd argue that the next 4 years is the most important time for the Qld LNP, even more so than the election itself. They have a chance to prove that they‚Äôre a reasonable party that can make good laws, and shake off the Newman stink.
95. Definitely just wait and vote on your own. You can make a decision and it's a good time to see how the state goes the next 4 years. LNP do hate the gays, coloured, women and poor people a bit. Most of their policy is based around that. So if you are outside that group you're probably fine
