Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. You just don't get it do you.... Sitting in your ivory tower looking down upon the plebs. I know it may be hard for ignoramuses such as yourself to understand but, you can't in your right mind look out your Brisvegas window and say no crime here so must be all good across the state. There is more to Qld than just Brisbane and there definitely is a crime problem within areas of Queensland. 2023 crime rate for all offences in Mackay. 18,598/100,000 people. 2023 crime rate for all offences in Brisbane. 9,043/100,000 people. Mackay has more than double the crime rate of Brisbane in 2023. 2024 to date crime rate for Mackay. 14,807/100.000 people. 2024 to date crime rate for Brisbane. 6,818/100,00 people. Again, Mackay has more the double the crime rate of Brisbane. For 2023 Cairns had almost 3 x the rate of Brisbane. 2024 Cairns had more than 3 x the rate. For 2023 Townsville had 2 x the crime rate, 2024 Townsville had 2 x the crime rate. for 2023 Rockhampton had more than 3 x the rate and 2024 Rocky experienced nearly 3.5 x the crime rate. And the list goes on.... You may think that this is acceptable as you may not live in these areas but the people in the regions do not accept this and so have voted the ALP out as a result. By denying the facts and ignoring the regions you will never fix the crime problems which exist there, which is fine by me as it will ensure a 2nd LNP term.
2. Does that count for you too? Seeing as you spend all your time on reddit…
3. [deleted]
4. thats what a democracy is
5. Bahaha. I had no idea that you all treated the Handmaids Tale as a documentary.
6. Sounds like you need a Whaaambulance
7. Yes, I can. I can also tell you what I think. You can accept the fact that people disapprove of you not voting, chill.
8. No, it isn’t. Why are people that don’t know what they’re voting for able to have a say? Their say means nothing, if you were to talk to them, you’d realise these people don’t know what they’re talking about, they don’t understand the policies of either party, their vote means absolutely nothing in that respect. Yet it means something to the election as it’s a number that counts. Be cooler if only people that understood what they’re were voting for could vote, and affect the future of states and the nation.
9. No neither party offer anything I want so I vote for the closest to that but I still have my bias against left wings politics so I vote right but most “far right” political party’s in Australia are only small so nobody votes for them I personally tighter border control decriminalisation of marijuana to a similar extent to the us and our self defence laws to be actually worth having and to stop cutting funds towards health care pensioners police lower taxes overall especially on alcohol so we can have a actual nightlife scene in Australia people can afford to go and do and take some off the bullshit power from police ie jacks law and all the being able to hassle people without a real reason and give them the ability to lock actual criminals up if any one party offers that sweet they have my vote
10. Paid for with mining royalties. Queensland has been running a surplus for years.
11. Can I help you? The other guy and I were having a conversation. (Is the energy I'd hit you wish if you were in front of me, learn to read the room
12. Modern day slavery is very different from slavery as you think it. It was definitely comparable to a prisoner work camp st the very least. To downplay from slavery I'd say things like, compulsory, required, mandatory, non-optional With negative consequences if you didn't turn up. But yeah you could make the choice to not turn up. But you'd lose your welfare payments if you chose not To. Still free to choose though I admit I have a bias as well. And no worries thanks for being a normal person on this post. Have a wonderful afternoon back then I was lazy and didn't want to work. Still didn't deserve that tho haha
13. Nah there's no misrepresentation, you lot just don't like being called out for your regressive thinking.
14. I’m saying a lot of people went into the polls thinking labour is soft on crime even when crime in their area is down because the messaging had hammered it as a state wide issue. Crime being up for 10% of the population in areas with the toughest problems is not indicative of a systemic failure of the government. LNP campaigned on fearmongering and on the media blowing specific cases out of proportion. And yes I think a lot of voters bought the story and let it influence their vote… I think they got conned and I think they conned by an appeal to their baser instincts. That’s a pretty established tactic that appeals to the conservative side of the public.
15. Again, I am not from Brisbane nor did I mention Brisbane once. Not sure what ivory tower you think i live in or why you keep making shit up. Since you seem to have difficulty with reading I will explain this as clearly as i can. In Mackay in 2020 there were 9173 offences committed. In Mackay in 2021 there were 8802 offences committed. In Mackay in 2022 there were 8350 offences commited. In Mackay in 2023 there were 9042 offences committed. The crime rate now is lower than it was in 2020 so where is this massive spike in crime in Mackay? The answer is that it only exists in your head.
16. Brilliant comeback
17. [removed]
18. Sounds like reality hitting home and you are projecting a bit. But hey, who knows.
19. Actually good point. Have a good day
20. If that’s your feeling, you should be advocating for education, not the disenfranchising of our fellow citizens because they don’t have the time or resources to learn.
21. Tbh mate, just writing the way you do tells me everything I need to know.
22. The mining royalties did not directly fund anything - Those royalties went into general revenue
23. While we’re 150odd billion in debt? And accumulating more faster then we can pay off? Not to mention the net 0 bullshit we won’t be mining anything soon. China and any other nation willing to line the governments pockets will be allowed instead😂 next will be farming and manufacturing. Vote labor vote greens🫣
24. Sorry mate, you were posting on a public forum so.......
25. I voted Labor this election...
26. Not just Aboriginal communities goose. Cairns, Mackay, Townsville, Rockhampton, Mt Isa, Bundaberg, etc. all have a much higher crime rate than Brisbane. Some of them 4 times the crime rate. As CheeseBurger says the hard data and facts are right there on the Qld police web site if you choose to educate yourself. It can't be denied and if you still say it is not so, then it is dills such as yourself who simply excuse away the facts with your inner-city dwelling decision making, that have caused the ALP to lose.
27. I'm not sure your first statement is entirely true. You would need to ask the LNP voters in areas which are safer for their reason why they voted the way they did. I haven't seen anything to indicate either way. This is the problem with echo chambers, people of opposing views are often shouted out of the conversation. About 40% of QLDers live outside of SEQ and have a bit of unity around being regional/rural. They felt they were neglected by the state government and crime was just one example, not the only one. ALP fear mongered too, let's be a little bit less biased. I'm not sure the LNP blew it out of proportion. Their solution of locking up kids is stupid as shit, but at least they acknowledged there even was a problem.
28. Look the LNP said they were an adult… I can explain everything.
29. reality hitting home that the lnp somehow won?
30. ✌️
31. It’s possible to do both. I support, and wish, people were more educated about what they’re voting for. I also wish people had to be educated on what they’re voting for before they were allowed to have any impact on the future of our state or nation in any way.
32. I believe people should have a choice not have to bow that’s it
33. Which funds the things mentioned
34. Ffs, look at the proposed budgets between the two major parties. There's fucking nothing between them in projected debt. One side is going to get there by cutting services and scrapping energy infrastructure and one was going to get there with royalties from mining. What the fuck are you even yapping about?
35. Everything you just said is bullshit made up by Murdoch. There you have it folks this is how you lost the best premier in the country
36. Oh nah nah nah I meant like. You can. And I did reply. And I've replied again I'm just saying that's the type of energy I'd hit you with I'd still hear you out dude haha
37. Good for you.
38. I didn't say it wasn't an issue, but again tougher penalties for kids who assault guards isn't making communities safer, and i very much doubt the problem is larger than it is. Keep living in fear boomer. Yeah just as I thought, there is no 23-24 data set currently, only 22-23 so old data for one. Next 10-17 youth crime is up 13 percent, a whopping unique offenders is up 0.1 percent, hardly a massive crime spree and you can all dial the data down and see that yes, aboriginal and Torres Strait islander youths make up over half of 10-17 offenders. So a big scare campaign and a problem over inflated to score political points.
39. Again I don’t get what you think you’re saying “the other guys had a stupid solution… but hey at least they didn’t try to show me the research that showed why my feelings are wrong” I grew up in rural Qld and I have a reasonable good idea of what those communities can be like. I wouldn’t put exposure to a diversity of ideas high on that list. I think it’s very easy to sway them on dissatisfaction and easy targets. Again the classic resentment that not enough is spent on “rural” qld is another one that’s easy to play up. And for what a party that has a proven track record of being worse?
40. We all know if you tossed enough monkeys in a room with typewriters eventually you would get Shakespeare. But no one ever expected that if you tossed enough donkeys in a room with ballot boxes you would get the government of Queensland.
41. 😁
42. Democracy means no exceptions, my friend. We may not like the results but I’d fight to the death to defend my political enemy’s right to vote.
43. Nope it Funds General budget of which are in deficits Those election promises had no future funding guarantees
44. Dribbling from the mouth like they always do.
45. There is no change to the royalties structure under LNP. There is a change to the royalties revenue coming in though. This is due to the royalty revenue per unit of product sold being on a sliding scale. When commodity prices are high the royalty price/unit is high. When the commodity price is low, the royalty price /unit will be low. The royalties payments in the future will be back to traditional levels because commodity prices are currently low.
46. Oh no, no that pesky Murdoch again.... Can't the ALP take any responsibility for their bungling of Qld? This is why they were ousted.
47. Pull your head out of your backside and do a quick google search of Queensland's debt. We aren't in surplus, we are billions in debt.
48. Yes 2024 data is there. Remember to look at rates not numbers. Not a boomer. That would be Mum and Dad.
49. I'm not supporting the other guys. I am against misrepresenting other voters and the facts around the crime statistics.
50. I would too, if they could prove they understood what they’re voting for.
51. That would be like saying that a persons income doesn’t fund their housing and food because the person has a credit card debt
52. You haven't seen bungling, give it a year and the libs will show you.
53. You do not understand economics very well do you?
54. ***People*** make money when they work and consume. The ALP govern to the principle 'look after the ***people*** and they can work harder and make more money to spend'. The LNP does not approach the matter this way. The LNP flog the people and strip them of services so the LNP can give free money to their morbidly obese mining mates.
55. I see you're trying to interpret raw data, well I just had a look and it's not promising for your argument. And like I said from the 22-23 collated report there was only 0.1 increase in UNIQUE offenders, and trends don't generally make massive changes so it's not likely changed and again aboriginal and Torres Strait islander youths make up over half all offenders 10-17. So you can keep quaking in your boots.
56. Ha, what a muppet.. Best you pack your shit up and move to Vic. Their election is in 2026 so better start on the campaign.
57. I guess there is no convincing you with facts. Oh well, you just keep living your best life under a LNP state government.
58. Stop projecting. I am not one of the muppets that voted for their own selfish interests.
59. Oh I see, it's all about the facts is it? Well fact is youth crime while a problem like all crime is vastly overblown.
60. Sorry, Are you going to be OK?
61. Is it though? The point was that Crime may be OK where you are in Brisvegas, but it is not OK in the regions. It is a concept you still fail to grasp...
62. Oh yes. I have serious doubts about kids with abusive parents though.
63. Hahaha, if you'd actually gone over the data like you claim to, you'd see crime is barely higher than Brisbane, and in fact if you group the entire greater Brisbane area together it is fact higher than the "regions" and finally "outback" is the highest contributor to crime as an area. So the one failing the concept test is not me.
64. Ahh, no it is not. Here is the link. [https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/queensland-crime-statistics/](https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/queensland-crime-statistics/)
65. LOL. If most people had a conversation with Crisafulli for ten minutes, they'd realise what a bigoted, self-important jackass he is.
66. Hmmm. OK. Are you looking forward to dismantling the various programs started by the previous government? 50c PT fares funded by mining royalties - royalties charged as an access fee to resources owned by us? I mean, we should see \*some\* payback for letting mining companies extract valuable resources. Subsidised school lunches? Cost-of-living energy rebates? Renewable energy programs like the pumped hydro projects? Please, give us your insights.
67. I talk to my boi Stevie weekly, top lad.
68. What are you looking forward to?
69. All these people saying they’re happy to see a change in government can never actually pinpoint a reason why, and can never go further than a personal insult at Miles or something about a youth crime crisis. Yes some of the reaction in this sub has been overblown, but you’d know there’s good reason for that if you were alive and conscious in QLD in 2012-15. And also the fact this Labor gov has given us way more cost of living relief than any other state and have put out one of the biggest renewable energy plans in the world, without raising taxes and with two straight surpluses. I’m confused why you’d be so desperate to change that
70. I love Queensland. I moved here just over 2 years ago. But I have to say the majority of people while lovely, are simple minded folk. Which seems to be why conspiracy theories, wellness woo and like have such a strong hold. It’s really not a flex to be part of the qld majority. You’re better than that.
71. Don’t bother mate… This sub is hard left leaning. There’s no point saying anything nice/positive about any conservative political parties in QLD. You’ll just get an army of Labor and Greens fanatics calling you dumb and relentlessly repeating all of Steven Miles’ fear campaign slogans.
72. Im extremely confident you will see this government operation like the highly effective and Brisbane City Council, focused on infrastructure, service delivery and moderate social initiatives.
73. Only thing that bugged me about him was that thing he had going on with his mouth, reminded me of Supernintendo chalmers assistant Leopold.
74. Im extremely confident you will see this government operation like the highly effective and Brisbane City Council, focused on infrastructure, service delivery and moderate social initiatives.
75. I'm more concerned about who is behind him. Smart people are rarely picked for public office. People like SC are there for the public relations aspect. Which is strange, 'cos he's a creep. It's the power brokers behind the scenes that I'm worried about. The LNP leader can be replaced on a whim.
76. Coal & iron ore royalties are forecast to fall. If you know what's happening in China their domestic demand for steel (and the coal to fire the mills) has gone off a cliff. Add in Trump's expected victory and the anticipated dropoff in demand for Chinese exports and aussie resources demands go further south.
77. Yeah you’re completely right, why vote a change in government because the previous has put programs in place. Judging by the list you’ve provided I can see you’ve easily been bought. I want to see some genuine money spent on infrastructure not buying votes in the form of transit fares lol
78. And people like your are the exact reason why the LNP won (and also why the referendum failed btw). The electorate doesn’t make mistakes, and insulting the voter base (especially their intelligence), is a very quick way to turn off voters
79. I love Queensland and its people. I’m sorry you feel that way, have you considered moving back to Melbourne?
80. Okay and please tell me what infrastructure plans has David brought forward that won your vote
81. What money brother labor had the mining company as a piggy bank, lets see oh yeah that's being scrapped for zero reason at all. So you aren't gonna see shit be built mate, Crisafulli's gonna do what Newman did and have kunts fix up the area around his house. So unless you live in bulimba with the prick you ain't seeing fuck all built mate. Can't wait to see the guy who's just parroted the word plan, with checks note's; no plan at all turn QLD in to a utopia through cuts. Would be nice to see that state owned energy infrastructure be built, oh wait that's gonna be cut, for checks notes smaller pumped hydro, quickly checks LNP costings; no money allocated at all to smaller pumped hydro infrastructure they claimed they were gonna do. Nothing will be built its cut, sell, privatize, so yes I will gladly sit back as things go backwards and watch fnq and the regions reap what they sow from fingers crossed an LNP majority because I did my best to stop the fire but shit I'm gonna watch it burn and hope it burns fast through a majority LNP.
82. Haha. Truth hurts. But seriously we can’t even have fluoride in our water because of the amount of fucking idiots in our region.
83. I’ve only been there once for work. I didn’t care for the place. “So long as they (the Proles) continued to work and breed, their other activities were without importance. Left to themselves, like cattle turned loose upon the plains of Argentina, they had reverted to a style of life that appeared to be natural to them, a sort of ancestral pattern...Heavy physical work, the care of home and children, petty quarrels with neighbors, films, football, beer and above all, gambling filled up the horizon of their minds. To keep them in control was not difficult.” They would buy the Murdoch tabloid press for the sport, and occasionally turn to the front to be told who to vote for.
84. The truth is, Labor lost, the Greens lost, and if you want to keep on insulting the electorate’s intelligence, then look forward to losing more.
85. I don’t do it to their face, I smile and nod when they tell me my friend who are climate scientists that’s are obviously corrupting the data so they can keep their cushy jobs, or how covid was all a government conspiracy to test how much they can control us.
86. Gonna be tough from memory the Senate inquiry into Murdoch media said he own +90% of QLD print media
87. Here is a start from Perplexity AI for you… **Positives:** - **Economic Growth:** Queensland’s economic growth has generally exceeded the national average, driven by strong population growth, resources investment, and robust mining and service sectors[4]. - **Employment:** The state has experienced strong employment growth, with low unemployment rates compared to historical standards[3][4]. - **Infrastructure and Services:** Significant investments in health, education, and infrastructure have been made to support population growth and improve living standards[1]. **Negatives:** - **Fiscal Challenges:** The government has faced fiscal challenges, including managing deficits and debt levels[1][2]. - **Labour Shortages:** Persistent labour supply shortages, especially in construction, have posed challenges[1]. - **Housing Affordability:** Rapid population growth has strained housing supply and affordability[1].

88. Guardian
89. Do your own analysis.
90. Hahahahahahahaha the Guardian with unbiased political analysis. Geez, tell me you haven’t got a single original thought in your mind without telling me. If you actually want unbiased news, 7 or 9 are probably your best places, as they are commercial news stations and have to cater towards both sides to get advertising revenue
91. Where would someone start with a project like this?
92. That's a fucking hot take
93. >unbiased news, 7 or 9 How can I put this to you gently? If you believe that, I've got a bridge to sell you. Only slightly used, going cheap.
94. All they have to do to get ad revenue is run an extremely corporatist programme.
95. Data collection sites. Preferably reputable/peer reviewed ones. Pick a topic and start there, don't tey to cover too many bases or you'll get overwhelmed. Even starting with a simple premise like "who is the better economic manager" will take a long time to gather the required data.
96. How awesome is reddit? Either it's they're a bad faith actor or they believe it's the truth. I fucking hate this timeline.
97. It’s been like 12 hours and they’re already softening us up for a policy backflip.
98. “It’s not part of our plan… but we’ve revised said plan, and now it is”.
99. Dude's not even in office yet and already the promises are being rolled back.
100. >One of the federal Coalition's most senior figures has made clear he expects Queensland's new LNP government to fall into line on nuclear power should the Coalition win the next federal election. >David Crisafulli and the Queensland LNP ran on a platform opposed to nuclear power in Queensland, at odds with their federal Coalition colleagues. >The federal Coalition has detailed a plan to roll out nuclear power nationwide should it win office, including two nuclear power plants in Queensland. >But in the wake of the LNP's election win in Queensland, federal Nationals leader David Littleproud has made clear he would expect all states, including Queensland, to fall into line should the Coalition win the next federal election.
101. Nuclear power is NBN 2.0. Remember how he said it wasn't his plan? Well, that's correct. The Fed will force it over ruling the state, but it is still not Crisafullis plan, though.
102. Littleproud is such a deadshit. The Queensland LNP ostensibly ran on a non-nuclear policy. How is that a mandate? Fucking Maranoa, man.
103. Ah yes lets use the most expensive source of energy generation instead of following the plan that is currently laid out by Labor which sets QLD up to be a powerhouse, the LNP don't have to do anything but commit funding to the projects and let it roll out thats of course if they don't start cancelling the pumped hydro projects which is one of the most important pieces.
104. ANY nuclear plan will be met with a great deal of lawsuits.
105. Roll over for Dutton. Good boy.
106. It won't happen because nobody will want it in their backyard. It's a wedge to argue for coal to be retained as 'baseload' until nuclear comes online.
107. And we're surprised/s
108. They say miles has poor form not conceding. Dickhead Dave has poor form not waiting till at least the start of the first business day of his new gov to fuck us over.
109. inb4 plant melts down during construction works overseen by LNP lackies.
110. Once the state remembers what a bunch of incompetent scoundrels the LNP are it will hurt the federal vote in Queensland. Dutton isn’t getting in.
111. Coalition can EAD
112. I'm all for nuclear power, as long as it's in lnp seats and near their MPs house. Will need some hectic security though, kids might steal it or do a crime on it
