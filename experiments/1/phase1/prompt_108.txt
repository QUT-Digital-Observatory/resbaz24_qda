Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Oh no I meant that you claim to care about people and the groups I mentioned in particular and then voted for the party that will hurt them the most. I was just impressed at your tirade giving you the gold in mental gymnastics. Your claims to care are just that, claims. To make you feel less monstrous when you vote for people planning to make life more miserable for the most vulnerable groups.
2. And when did you think the P/B hydro was going to be complete? They published a 2035 completion date. If Snowy hydro is any thing to go by it will be 10x over budget and 5 years late. No matter which energy transition plan we are going for, they are going to have to build new gas fired plants to cover the coal plants retiring. That was always on the cards.
3. We have had a nuclear industry and a nuclear reactor in Australia for decades. [https://www.ansto.gov.au/](https://www.ansto.gov.au/) Hinkley point c is a first of its kind reactor so is expensive and lengthy time for approvals of the new design. Use a next of its kind such as the Korean made APR-1400 reactor to bring the cost and build times down.
4. You are referencing a first of it's kind reactor which will be more expensive and time consuming than a next of it's kind reactor. All safety approvals on an untested designs needs to be completed before constructing the reactor. This is time consuming. *"Greatrex says Sizewell C will benefit from Hinkley Point C having been through the regulatory hoops and built the supply chains, reducing the likelihood of similar cost and deadline blowouts. “The big lesson from Hinkley is, don’t consider doing one in isolation,” he says."* Don't forget we already have a nuclear industry and regulator. [https://www.ansto.gov.au/](https://www.ansto.gov.au/) Given that physics does not change from the northern to the southern hemisphere and we build reactors that have previously been built such as the APR-1400, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APR-1400](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APR-1400) much of the regulatory work is already done saving time. Estimates I have seen coming from experts is 11-12 years and $12b/reactor. This is comparable to Pumped hydro and offers 24-7 base load supply. These are similar time scales to the renewables build and when costs are calculated correctly they end up cheaper. Each new reactor we build will see costs and build time/reactor come down. No one takes into account that these nuclear reactors are 80-100 year assets which GenCost failed to take into account. Gencost also failed to consider the cost of storage in their report and that batteries have to be replaced every 10 years, wind every 20-30 and solar, every 20-25 years. Please also consider the cost of transmission lines with a 100% renewable system. The transmission system will need to quadruple in size and so will the transmission proportion of your electricity bill. Currently 10% of your bill. In the short term we can purchase the fuel from overseas until we can get our own enrichment facilities up and running. Afterall they don't use much. It still seems an open and shut case for my mind. Yes renewables at first glance may look to get us to our net-0 targets quicker but you will have a lesser, unreliable energy system than if we did our energy transition in a staged, well thought out and sensible approach. We need strong leadership, who are willing to make generational decisions for the good of the country, not weak ones making decisions for election cycles.
5. UAE did not build their plant with slaves. They were skilled international workers and many of them Australians. $50b for 24-7 dispatchable 5gw of base load power at zero emissions for the next 80-100 years is a reasonable price. Remember in comparison batteries last for 10 years only. Wind turbines 20-30 years. Solar panels 20-25 years at best. then throw in the massive amounts of transmission lines required for renewables that we the consumer have to pay for and maintain, nuclear stacks up quite well and is reliable.
6. It stands to reason then to ask why has the union movement paid so much to the ALP. Same as the other crowd I guess, it is in their best interest and where their constituency base is from. All sides of politics do it. If the people don't like it then express our views and have laws change so donations are not allowed.
7. No mate, the electricity companies would not turn on the supply to the town. Once the main transmission line was down, they could not properly regulate the frequency. *"The fact that the wind farm and the solar farm aren’t operating with the transmission line is understandable. But the big battery is supposed to be – and that could in turn have allowed the wind and solar to produce. No one is saying what’s gone wrong, but many suspect it’s a matter of oversight rather than technology.* *“You need to talk to Transgrid,” said one. “You should talk to Essential,” says another. “Ah, that’s AGL’s asset, you better talk to them.” And then. “No, Tilt Renewables own those. Give them a ring.” And finally, “we don’t have an official statement now, but we are trying to sort it.”* Looks like another renewable smoke screen....
8. I did, I’m not a main character like you, I’m able to look at proposed policy objectively and think about more then myself. Thankfully this is a skill majority of people have, and obviously the ballots reflect that.
9. There we go again the moral righteousness coupled with you, knowing it all. Me, (and the majority of the state) believe the proposed policy is best for these people. But hey, what do you know, you know better than all of us and think we are wrong, or think we are brainwashed. 🤣 Not going to get tired of seeing this from the reddit progressives I’m starting to understand other positions so much more now.
10. I think you are underestimating how important it is to get to net 0 quicker. Slowing that down is not "sensible".
11. > $50b for 24-7 dispatchable 5gw of base load power at zero emissions for the next 80-100 years is a reasonable price. Except we know it will be more than that, no one would assume you could build something in regional qld for the same price as a third world country. >or 24-7 dispatchable 5gw Which is going to lose money for half the day like the coal plants currently do.
12. Oh right, Yeah I’m on the side of workers. So i align politically with where the unions go. Again the people who have all the money want the LNP, makes it unlikely they are the best for the average everyday Queenslander. And iirc LNP received 4 times the money ALP did, largely from the mining sector. It absolutely looks like they are trying to buy something… can’t imagine what /s.
13. "*No mate, the electricity companies would not turn on the supply to the town. Once the main transmission line was down, they could not properly regulate the frequency.*" Who would of thought a privatising the energy grid would have issues. "*Looks like another renewable smoke screen....*" Can't get any better then the Nuclear energy smoke screen which is a cover for Fossil fuel use.
14. Hey lil buddy I want you to do me a favour - it's kinda like homework. Over the next few weeks keep watching your fav news shows like 7 and sky news - and don't forget the courier mail too. Just notice how youth crime just magically disappears. Then you will finally understand that you've been played like a fiddle 🎻to perfection 👌
15. Just be honest with what you believe, dude. What are these policies that you think will help the groups you pretend to care about?
16. It sure is sensible. No need to rush the largest investment our generation will make in nearly 100 years.
17. UAE is not a 3rd world country. If you believe we could not build a Nuclear power plant on budget in regional Queensland then the same goes for the Pumped Hydro so your point is moot. The only reason power is in negative costs is due to too much solar. This is why the brakes need to be put on the renewables roll out.
18. Who would have thought renewables is worth didly squat unless connect to base load power for frequency regulation. Again, reliability goes out the window with renewables and in Nth Qld we are in a cyclone area so can expect a big blow every second year or so to leave us in the dark if we keep going down this road. That will be a regional problem though hey, no need to fret.
19. More arguments in bad faith. 🤣. Once again just proving my original comment: you’re incapable of accepting other people’s values, experiences and opinions. You believe you’re more intelligent and better then majority of the state, hence why you’re sat in the losers column and the rest of the state is quietly breathing a sigh of relief the good guys brought it home. 💪🏻
20. Harsher sentencing will protect the most vulnerable right now and allow us time to create social policies to influence the future, but as it stands taxpayers feel unsafe for themselves and loved ones. Also am a big fan of this 100 day plan and David’s first 10 day plan. There’s also some local promises that will impact my community in massive ways which I’m quite excited for.
21. >UAE is not a 3rd world country For the wealthy ruling class its good https://media.business-humanrights.org/media/documents/files/UAE_and_Migrant_Workers_Rights_Briefing_Final.pdf For the workers there, not so much. >The only reason power is in negative costs is due to too much solar. This is why the brakes need to be put on the renewables roll out. And there we have the crux of it, its not about generating power in 20ish years, its about stopping renewable development now. Unfortunately in competitive power generation system (the nem) generation that struggles to follow the load is going struggle when faced with low capital cost, zero input cost generation. Just as is happening to the coal plants now.
22. Is it that hard to keep watching the news reports and take notice that the youth crime reporting will go down significantly in Queensland?
23. So your best policy to help vulnerable people is kids in cages? Not the 45m they wanna cut from homeless support, you think locking children up will be more of a net benefit to homeless populations than that 45m. Now I know why you voted LNP. 🤡 This is what I meant, just be honest, you didn’t vote to support vulnerable communities. You voted because your area was made promises and you think that children doing hard time with other hard criminals will lower crime rates. This is what I meant, just be honest with your beliefs. Stop using helping vulnerable people as a scapegoat
24. It is not about stopping the roll out of renewables it is about getting the right mix. I have never said only nuclear. Studies have shown a mix of renewables with battery storage, some gas and nuclear base load to be the best and most reliable near zero emissions systems for industrialised countries. Roof top solar owners are about to be hit with a sun tax because of too much solar being built. These large scale energy suppliers will not be hit with the bill for over supply, they have government guarantees for the sale of electrons produced no matter how little or how much they generate. That is the carrot the government is giving them to invest in Qld renewables roll out. There is no risk to them. This is 12% of our electricity bill already and now add on the sun tax all paid for by the consumer, i.e. you and me and now roof top solar owners. When will we start removing these subsidies so the roll out is properly staged to better meet supply and demand. When can we see if these Large scale renewables generators can stand on their own feet without the populace needing to prop them up. If subsidies were removed I bet we would see a more considered approach to what mix of renewables would be rolled out. Nowhere near so much solar without adequate storage to soak up excess generation during peak sun times currently requiring electricity prices going into negative. As we have seen in the last 5 years or so this will not happen. Just a haphazard approach to the transition, all to the detriment of the hip pockets of the populace and to the benefit of the private corporations building these renewable energy farms.
25. No, and I’m looking forward to seeing youth crime drop in real time! Let’s go!!!
26. To call it kids in cages is just arguing in bad faith. Which you insistent on doing, and no, I don’t think the homeless support helps the taxpayer feel safe immediately. Your ad hominem attacks mean nothing to me, this is how majority of the state feels, I don’t feel any type of way by someone who thinks they’re above other people morally for there choices on policy attacking me, all I have to say to that is grow up. And no, I voted based on which policies I think would best affect me, my community and state as a whole. Which is perfectly reasonable, your insinuations really just once again prove that anyone who doesn’t vote specifically how you view the world is brainwashed or outright wrong. Lmao, hey at least you’re consistent.
27. > When will we start removing these subsidies so the roll out is properly staged to better meet supply and demand. When can we see if these Large scale renewables generators can stand on their own feet without the populace needing to prop them up. Which is ironic as a nuclear power plant will need to be 100% funded by the public to build and its losses on operation will need to be covered by the public as well.
28. This whole conversation has been about you claiming you care about marginalised and vulnerable groups. Shifting the goal posts to what makes the taxpayer feel safe is a farce. Putting kids in prison for 10-15 years where they will meet other criminals and come out with no socialisation skills or work skills are going to reoffend. And all of this before their brain is fully developed and potentially missing the important 20s) All you’re doing with a policy like this is kicking the can down the road to land on a (hopefully labour by your perspective) new government. Initiatives like free lunches aren’t enough on their own but they’re a good thing. These areas need to see systemic change that’s more than locking them up and throwing away the key. Systemic issues can’t be solved instantly like you want. You’re not preventing new people from committing crime and you’re just moving the current problem into the future.
29. Yes and be a Government asset for the next 80-100 years (unless sold off in the mean time). The government will need to invest in Nuclear first to give confidence to the private sector that we are not going to reverse the nuclear generation rules come next election cycle.
30. No it hasnt, that was a singular point to the wider conversation, I do care about society’s most vulnerable people but I’m not a single issue voter, and I do believe the policies put forth help with that. Children committing violent crimes repeatedly is a rising issue, and the taxpayer is over the slaps on the wrist, as far as I’m concerned lock them up and throw away the key. I’m less concerned for there wellbeing and more concerned about the victims and potential victims of there reign of terror they’ve enjoyed. Free lunches aren’t going to stop taxpayers feeling unsafe for themselves and there family, which is in my opinion, the immediate concern on this issue. (And clearly echoed by the majority of the state) You can disagree all you like, but it’s what the majority of the state are concerned about and feel like is the best path forward, to try and frame it like its people wanting anyone to suffer or have any type of control is straight up disingenuous. You need to learn to accept that other people have different views based on there values, experiences and most importantly concerns. You and your echo chamber aren’t the only people in Queensland. FYI.
31. Classic. Absolutely 0 facts and just a diatribe about how your in the majority for the first time in 12 years. Good for you Btw you are a single issue voter. The only policy you’ve mentioned is locking up kids and throwing away the key and you don’t care at whose expense.
32. 🤣🤣 more ad hominem attacks. Youre nothing if not consistent. The fact is: Majority of the state felt that these policies were the best for the state. To not accept that, and to say it’s because they’re brainwashed, they’re stupid and to insinuate you’re so much better morally and more intelligent is nothing but hilarious. That’s the policy I’ve mentioned because it’s what you’ve addressed, it’s like talking to a brick wall though, there’s nothing you can do. Godspeed to you accepting the fact that people exist in this state, country and world who don’t think exactly like you and maybe have different values, ideas and beliefs.
33. I have literally not claimed any of that. It’s a fine straw man though. I asked YOU what was an example of the policy that helped vulnerable people, YOU brought up putting kids in prison. Keep telling me how I think though. It’s really ironic.
34. Did you forget it’s his party who wants to introduce the conscience vote to repeal abortion laws?
35. What sort of moron idolises a politician? Parasite.
36. Let a thousand crocodiles bloom….
37. Economically KAP is a bit left isn’t it? Favours nationalization of industries? Just the social views are stuck in the 1950s
38. Bobs son in law Robert Nioa is CEO of Nioa Group the largest importer and supplier of firearms and munitions in the country ( and obviously a very significant donor to KAP).
39. Not taking that bait
40. That hat. Is magnificent!
41. And because of his party the election was actually remotely close, dude absolutely screwed the liberals so close to the election.
42. Yes, contrary to what the comments are trying to paint me as (I'm an ALP voter), I'm actually FOR what he did to that shithead in the LNP.
43. What sort of moron can't take a joke?
44. Lol.you perfect bastard
45. Yep. It's a shame about the social policies.
46. That's the National Party in a nutshell. Socially conservative agrarian socialists.
47. I'm a Langist. He's right up my alley actually :) and he's pro reintroducing domestic industry which is one of the things i want most for the country.
48. Well it makes sense, one of his key policy positions (and passions) is to make it easier for farmers and law-abididing citizens to get guns for personal defence.
49. Seeing the most boomer-looking guy in this election absolutely uppercut the libs on abortion was weirdly satisfying
50. I think you’re giving him a lot of credit, bro isn’t playing 4d chess here. He’s a senile old man.
51. The national party is a rubber stamp for liberals nowadays though. It stopped being worth anything a long time ago.
52. Just something to keep in mind when he plays the US gun culture card which is often. BTW I'm a registered firearms owner but don't shoot anymore (have no guns in my possession now and won't renew my licence when it expires). I've got no problems with appropriate guns, owned by the right sort of people for certain purposes but equating firearms with freedom or security or some sort of political identity is something I don't want to see here.
53. Even so he did a good thing. Give the guy his flowers at least.
54. He spat on my daughter once so nah
55. *Shows general upward trend nation-wide* "Haha wow QLD sucks huh?"
56. What?
57. Nice table or random numbers.
58. Labor across the country pushing renewables has pushed up electricity pricing. So they use our tax dollars to subsidise it rather than fix it. Good to see the rear end of labor for a while. Hopefully we can kick out albo next
59. How is this about renewables? Not all power? And what is the source?
60. How do renewable energy sources push up the cost of power?
61. Inefficient, inconsistent and expensive use of land. All of the energy companies have been investing in it and the result is an ever increasing power bill.
62. There is something called the "Renewable energy target". It forces retailers to buy green power over less expensive coal/gas power. The system is literally designed to make you pay more in exchange for renewables.
63. Considering its a competitive bid system for wholesale power, and solar and wind consistently bid in at lower $mwh than coal and gas, how again do renewables increase the cost of power? If they where more expensive they just wouldn't get dispatched.
64. So this week utility solar averaged $14 mwh and wind $75 mwh, while coal averaged $80 mwh. Retailers being forced to buy 18% of their power from renewable sources saved them money
65. Lack of consistency. They can't provide baseload power and aren't responsive to peaks. They are a bonus but hardly a suitable solution for the majority of power generation. You still need to have coal and gas power stations on standby for when solar and wind drop off to maintain supply. If any party was serious about clean energy, they'd stop making china money with solar panels and build nuclear stations. France was going to mothball theirs until the failed renewables push in the EU made them the single largest exporter of electricity to those countries who went full retard on solar and wind. Now the French are building more.
66. You can lead a horse to water, but by the time they feel like drinking it may have become be salty.
67. >You still need to have coal and gas power stations on standby for when solar and wind drop off to maintain supply. So why to they bid in so high if they are cheaper?
68. Wouldn't it be ideal if some force like gravity could be harnessed to generate electricity day round?
69. You missed the point. The coal and gas subsidise solar and wind. Once intalled, the renewables are cheap power. But only when they run. Which means when they run, coal and gas are still operating, being maintained but not producing in order to kick on when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesnt shine. They still need to maintain the potential for taking up the slack from renewables which is expensive. That downtime is costly and the more renewables there are, the less utilised they will be during a sunny or windy day, yet never be able to be decommissioned without storage options or another, better way of generating baseload power. More renewables drive up the price of power in this way. They still incur costs when they produce less power and you can't overload the grid with power. So they have to recoup costs when they do run and have less competition to boot, so higher bid. Renewables aren't consistent enough to shutter fossil fuel plants but they are cheap to run and cost little when they're off. They can't be turned on or off to meet demand, scaled up or down quickly. They are a bit of bonus power on a hot day or good to pump water for stored hydro, but will never be suitable to base a whole grid on. Please, go do some reading about how bad the euro power grid is and how reliant theyve become on french nuclear facilities.
70. >gas are still operating, Not gas, combined or open cycle have no problem starting snd stopping each day. Just very expensive to run. >So they have to recoup costs when they do run and have less competition to boot, so higher bid. Which is just a roundabout way of saying their more expensive. In our competitive bid system high input cost/ slow response generation like coal is always going struggle. That's why no private sources are clamouring to build new coal power stations, just lose money.
71. But your renewables are not every going to replace them. They just make them less efficient and the fossil fuel plants make more power. Creating inefficiencies is whats driving up the cost. At this point you're being wilfully ignorant. You're purposefully ignoring the glaring issues with solar and wind because of whatever indoctrination you've withstood. Free your mind and think a little. If anyone was serious about clean energy, they'd be building nuclear plants on the sites of end of life coal plants. Clearly the lefties just want to fuck up our country more than they already have and refuse to learn the lessons Europe and the US already have. Im out at this point.
72. I notice Channel Nine has stopped reporting on the youth crime epidemic. There's a non-problem solved already.
73. I thought there was only 2
74. They didn’t actually promise much, they kept their whole platform pretty ephemeral. Allow developer donations, change preferential voting, stop taxing coal companies, end a “youth crime wave” that by all metrics doesn’t really exist…
75. I think the fact that people are whinging about you whinging without providing policies or meaningful discussion speaks volumes about the LNP and their voter base.
76. They are cutting 200 million from Queensland Police.
77. Is this a mobile app thing or what? Your title implies you have posted a list or a link to the list, but instead just a whinge. So do you have facts or is this /r just going to be wringing from now on?
78. Hopefully they promised some remedial spelling programs
79. Closeness of the election? LOL. 21 seat majority!
80. Mate. Look at the figures. It wasn’t close! ALP’s worst election since 2014 and before that in 1908. The LNP have been on for 2 days! FFS.
