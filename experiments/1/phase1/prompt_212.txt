Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. In news just in "people like free stuff". But one of the reasons for parliament is that politicians are supposed to weigh the costs and benefits of policies and decide what provides good value for money. Almost every economist would say that state owned petrol stations and 50c public transport are a horrendous ideas, and most would also quibble free lunches for everyone. At a time when these policies will be funded by debt, they are incredibly silly.
2. I lived in Katter's electorate for a while, even spoke with him a few times. I am not a Katter voter, I think most of his policies are insane and the homophobia is awful. The reason why folks *do* vote for him is quite simple, though: agriculture. It's an agricultural seat. The Nationals long ago stopped being a genuine agrarian party, around the time Katter rebelled and left them. He has remained the one consistent voice angry about the supermarket duopoly, the one voice pushing for an ethanol mandate (which would benefit sugar farmers), he argues for agriculture export subsidies, you name it. If he wasn't such a shit show on everything that isn't agriculture I would say he is a decent choice to vote for. It's a pity he is an insane bigot.
3. Maybe some people don’t see abortion as the number 1 issue and will compromise with a candidate that mostly shares their beliefs, except some issues. It’s not stupidity, it’s what every voter has to do
4. There's three NQ ALP seats which are a genuine three way ALP v LNP v KAP contest. The main takeaway is the preference flows will be interesting on election night.
5. We do it so he can compromise with his voters he can't can it if the people support it
6. As someone who lives in the division of Gympie, the division where the Nationals and now LNP are that rusted on there could be no one left to cast a vote and they’d still get voted in. This is a fair assessment of the situation.
7. It'd be an interesting exercise if voting was blind. The candidates put forward their policies and the costings but you didn't know which party they belonged to, just what they wanted to do. Not suggesting it should happen, just a thought exercise. I suspect election outcomes would be quite different though.
8. People vote for many reasons. In my electorate, there are some people who have vowed not to vote for the local ALP Member because a drug and alcohol rehab is going to be built in their suburb. The facility isn't going to negatively impact them one bit once it's built, but such is their NIMBY vitriol that nothing else matters to them. One-issue voters are very strange people.
9. I mean... this is why I respect the LNP model and decision not to push a party policy on abortion rights. A party should have a diversity of viewpoints and should offer a variety of candidates for each seat. The ALP form rigid party policies and expect party members to tow the line. It doesn't matter which name is next to the box, all their candidates may as well be carbon copies of 'Generic Labor Candidate'. At least with the LNP you can find the candidates that share your view on issues like abortion and vote for them.
10. i was one of those kids who went to school hungry. it’s an amazing idwa
11. it will directly impact youth crime - most of the young criminals don't want to be at home due to DV, drugs etc so then roam the streets. Free food at schools for everyone is awesome. It won't solve the problem but will definitely help.
12. I won’t benefit directly from free school lunches, but it’s exactly the kind of thing I’d like my tax dollars spent on. Bravo I reckon.
13. Which news? If it’s 7/9/10 then of course all you’ll see are negative responses. They have a vested interest in getting the LNP in. Same when the 50c fares were introduced. All Channel 7 news could ask is “but at what cost!”
14. If you wanted to defund something that doesn't affect you why not start with womens and indigenous health services. Why do you draw the line at feeding children?
15. Bloody pinko commies wanna give people free stuff pfft. Lmao. I don't get how anyone wouldn't support this. God even America has such a program nationwide.
16. What did you do the last two elections which were both post Newman? (I’m a labor voter usually, so don’t disagree, but unless it’s your first time voting your comment doesn’t make a lot of sense).
17. Where are these policies announced?
18. Which parties are supporting this?
19. thats absolutely wrong and you are guessing. Servos don't make their money off fuel - they make it off the retail products they sell at point of sale. This won't put independent servos out of business if they arent taking the piss with fuel prices.
20. They have, unlike the LNP who literally refused to release costings until after the media blackout. Qld has also been in surplus for the last few budgets, and one of the few policies the LNP has that isn't "we will do that too" is giving coal mining multinationals their money back.. so...
21. I’ve asked you before and I’ll ask again: Value judgement aside, how is this astroturfing?
22. This higher and progressive coal royalties should help nicely with that.
23. I've got some good news for you then, QLD has had three surpluses in a row so they have been paying off some debt.
24. How does Queensland debt affect us as Queenslanders on a personal level though?
25. Who didn’t release costings? Even easier to make promises when you’re not willing to even say what you’ll actually do, let alone how you plan to pay.
26. Half of the policies listed are ones they've already done. It's not like they've just made shit up.
27. He’s already rolled out heaps of these changes though?
28. Oh how dare they support a political party. The horror...
29. So we shouldn't spend our tax dollars on.. the tax payers...?
30. What else do you propose the government do with our tax dollars and mining royalties. I’d definitely prefer to see that spent on the people in QLD. Pull your head out of your arse….
31. Government using the money we pay and it makes from assets to support the people it represents. What an unfair trade.
32. Why not make the mining companies pay for the product they sell, and give handouts with that money. Or do you like the likes of Gina and Clive to get a free ride (not like the Federal Government cares about changing the tax loopholes that mean they pay basically zero tax)?
33. We actually have record surpluses under Labor. Partly because of the mining royalties the LNP want to get rid of. “Queensland Treasurer Cameron Dick handed down the 2024-25 Budget in Parliament today, outlining a $2.746 billion turnaround from the forecast to a $564 million surplus in 2023-24. This is the state’s third operating surplus in a row, following the Queensland record $13.93 billion surplus in 2022-23.” [Source](https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/100536). And economists aren’t opposed to any of the things you mentioned. This is primarily because they tend to have a basic or better grasp of economics.
34. I don't think they would. The cost of the 50c fares is nothing compared to subsidies for the road network, and brings benefits including more money to spend elsewhere, and improved health/less health budget spending (some cities have crunched the numbers on the effects of increased walking to public transport, vs driving) I would expect the cost for school lunches could be very favorably weighed against the costs of childhood hunger and related poor school performance, behavioural issues etc That's assuming everything only has monetary value. If you consider both of those policies in terms of social and environmental value, they absolutely deliver.
35. > 50c public transport are a horrendous ideas This really isn't a horrible idea since cheap transport will make the economy work more better since more people with money in their pocket means more money that can be spent on goods and services or to get to work especially if they can now actually afford to get out and about. If you were a small business why wouldn't you want more possible paying customers. The fares have been largely subsidised for many of the routes anyways. Also the benefit of less cars on the roads. > > most would also quibble free lunches for everyone. Free lunches for kids. Means children don't go hungry, have the energy to learn, less inequity, and parents would have more time to you know, go work, and have money to spend on something else.
36. 50c public transport meant that people were moving around more and spending their money so that overpriced cafe in the towns/cities can stay afloat - a fantastic economic policy. Free lunches reduce crime - if the kids go to school just for a feed it's more likely they will stay for the day and not be out shoplifting/loitering. They aren't being funded by debt - If we actually got our fair share of mining royalties for OUR coal it would fund a lot more. What would you do better? the numbers don't lie, labor have been pretty strong economic managers, better than lnp. Rather than repeat soundbytes you heard perhaps look at some data and see if your opinion changes.
37. I understood that coal royalties would help, didn't we get a fair few billion from the increases already?
38. >Almost every economist would say... Are you able to substantiate this? >At a time when these policies will be funded by debt Are these not being funded by mining royalties? The same thing that gave Queensland the largest budget surplus ever reported by an Australian state in the history of Australia.
39. exactly my thoughts if he just stuck to agrarian policies and not the other crap
40. His brother is gay. Lives in Brisbane.
41. Sometimes, sacrifices have to made hell he even supported the unions from one nation one time
42. Which means that they are happy to have abortion banned as long as they get what they want. Sounds more like selfishness than stupidity.
43. We were talking about this at work the other. It would make more sense for everyone to vote for the actual outcome of a vote rather than voting for a party purely on the basis of that's who you usually vote for and let them basically decide what policies they see fit.
44. If they were honest about their policies (that would be an interesting exercise too) it would be fairly easy to pick the party.
45. We’d finally have a Green prime minister, lol
46. It's because as a party you debate these things in private and show solidarity in public. Hard to respect the LNP when you don't get a clear response on an issue
47. then there is no point voting for someone that is a member of a party - better to vote independent.
48. It’s okay to have a diversity of views, but at the end of the day only one policy gets voted in so a party line gives people transparency in what they are voting for.
49. Sorry to hear that. What was the situation for you? Parents couldn’t afford to buy breakfast/lunch food? Prioritised other things? Or didn’t understand the need to for adequate nutrition?
50. I never said I want to defund anything? I support the policy lol
51. By the voices in his head.
52. I can assure you I am not guessing.
53. The royalties will not be hanging around as they are based on a sliding scale. Commodity prices have significantly lowered and so will the royalty rates so bye bye super profits royalties.
54. Not true, Miles has stated that the free lunches will be paid for by more lending
55. Pigs arse they paid off debt. The state debt rose while claiming they produced a surplus.
56. Surpluses yes, but debt is increasing. There are billions of off the books projects and works that are increasing the debt You can see here https://budget.qld.gov.au/overview/economic-and-fiscal-overview/
57. By having to pay well over $1b/year just in interest. And this is set to rise significantly into the future if we do not get spending under control.

58. LNP
59. Both can be shit stop being tribal.

61. Apparently the Australia Institute went to the parallel world where the movie Idiocracy was filmed and surveyed those people. Or they surveyed greens voters. Same thing really. You can not grow a state based on stealing money from the productive people and hand it to the unproductive people and endless welfare. I was laughing with some public servants in their 60's being given reproductive leave by the stupid labor government. That is how spasticated state labor is. There is a reason why the bjelke-peterson government was so successful in forwarding Queensland so much with their massive infrastructure build, that was done at a reasonable cost.

64. And? You think family can’t be cruel to family?
65. Yeah, I know. It makes the homophobia all the more stunning. https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/katter-walks-out-of-interview-when-asked-about-gay-people/7514230
66. Tony Abbots sister is gay too, doesn’t mean a thing to bigots
67. Its all a trade off. Once you convince voters that abortion is a personal choice for women, and you know you or your partner won't need one soon, it isn't going to be more important than struggling to put healthy food on the table for your children. Other voters will say the right to an abortion is more important than fixing the economy, and the think that the LNP represent that. If Labor wins and the economy stays weak then they would call you selfish.
68. It sounds like Democracy. The stupidity comes in the ignorant pigeonholing of everyone into set groups without realising that people are allowed to have different priorities and are welcome to compromise on the lower preferences to secure the outcome they prefer.
69. That may be the way the ALP and the CCP does it... It favours voters who want a party platform handed to them, dumbed down to the dot points, and frankly it's a great way to dilute the effectiveness of a representative democracy. If you want your representatives to decide these things behind closed doors, that's your choice I guess... I mean, if a majority of elected Labor MPs were from religious backgrounds, would you be happy if they made a backroom deal to abandon the policy on abortion rights after being elected to their seats?
70. I mean... I have no issues with voting for independents if they would be the best representative of the voter's position on issues. Better to have a parliament that represents the electors than electors who feel they need to choose between two inflexible options like American politics. If someone considers it unportant for both stronger funding for policing AND access to abortions, isn't it better to have a choice of a candidate that will represent that view, then having to choose between the two issues?
71. Sure... A party line gives people who are lazy about their civic duty an easy option... which is why it works. I'd rather my representatives not be tied to a party policy that means my ballot is committed to one of two approaches dictating every single issue as though there are only two types of people, red or blue in the world. If I'm outsourcing my franchise for a period of years, I don't want to nominate a 'yes man' who is motivated by internal party politics. If we are paying a not-inconsiderable amount of money as a salary for our representatives, we deserve representatives who will consider the issues and vote according to conscience... not just based on how their boss tells them.
72. What I don't understand is the initial reluctance, I've yet to get an answer that isn't someone just being a total asshole because they hate kids. Subsidies for business good Subsidies for kids - fuck those little parasitic scum it's unhinged.
73. You mean by more Borrowing?
74. What is a rhetorical question?
75. Same goes dick nose. The post I was **responding to** (yours), would you describe that as tribal? Or is it only tribal if a point is made that the courier mail hasn’t already “refuted” for you?
76. Do you protest when our taxpayer dollars go to subsidise corporations that makes hundreds of millions of dollars? That doesn't involve Centrelink, bud.
77. So no - taxpayer money shouldn't be spent on taxpayers. Ok, Ayn, we get it.
78. Takers? IT'S OUR MONEY, NO!?
79. Tell us, what is your noble profession that makes you so superior and not benefit from the tax others pay?
80. Bjelke-Petersen Left office in 1987. Mate that’s 37 years ago. Developing infrastructure didn’t just suddenly halt. Oh, and here is a little snippet about your mate Joh in case you had forgotten. “Two of his state ministers, as well as the police commissioner Bjelke-Petersen had appointed and later knighted, were jailed for corruption offences and in 1991 Bjelke-Petersen, too, was tried for perjury over his evidence to the royal commission; the jury failed to reach a verdict as the jury foreman was a member of the Young Nationals and a member of the “Friends of Joh” group, and Bjelke-Petersen was deemed too old to face a second trial.”
81. But it's not being paid by productive individuals, its paid by charging mining companies the bare minimum to profit from QLD resources. You'll complain millions are being wasted on welfare and handouts to people who need them to survive, while ignoring the trillions lost from price gouging, wage theft and tax evasion.
82. > You dont pay for QLD coal There's a limit to how much coal is in the dirt and we should stand to benefit from it as much as possible since, you know, its ours? wtf
83. Cause they are addicted to free shit.
84. You're stunned by a QLD family not supporting a gay adult child that has come out?
85. absolutely agree - but if someone is a member of a party it's very telling where their beliefs lie.
86. The parties come up with policies through a process, both Labor and LNP do this. Realistically the gov will be run by one or the other of these two parties. By all means vote for an independent but it’s no more or less lazy to vote for anyone. People can still be politically and civically involved more than that, but everyone has to vote so it’s kinda nonsensical to call any vote lazier than another.
87. You're going to be very disappointed when you find out I voted Greens, both major parties can get fucked this year. So no my post was not tribal it was in direct response to OP. Also lol @ dick nose just relax you'll live a bit longer.
88. Like renewable energy companies? How much was paid to Twiggy Forest to before he pulled out of the Green hydrogen deal?
89. Old mate probably works in a gov subsidised industry, like mining or agriculture.
90. Our tax dollars should be spent where it is needed most. Not spent as a blanket 1 in all in type arrangement.
91. >Developing infrastructure didn’t just suddenly halt. How many dams has Labor built in the past thirty years? The Paradise Dam is one. You know the one that now is being completely dismantled and replaced at a cost of over a billion dollars because it was so shoddily built. How many power stations have they built? Kogan Creek is one. How many others? Now they are giving taxpayers money to super wealthy overseas corporations to privatise Queensland's electricity generation by stealth with unreliable technology. I do not give two fucks about the corruption when it comes to the infrastructure build and advancements all of Queensland benefitted from. the corruption is a different subject and has no bearing on the infrastructure build that was done with minimal debt. Let me ask you how many Labor MP's in Queensland have been jailed for raping/molesting children? It is more then one. How many Have been jailed for corruption?
92. Mining royalties only pay for a small percent of Qld GSP and even that small percent could not go towards paying down our debt. Those super profit royalties will not be there moving forward because the commodity prices have fallen so the royalty rates fall with them. There goes the surplus. We need better fiscal management of our budget now more than ever. The ALP spendathon has to stop and we need to start reducing debt.
93. [removed]

95. Not really, more stunned that the commenter above me thinks him having a gay brother wards off homophobia. The brazen ignorance of Katter saying he would walk backwards from Bourke if there were gay people in his electorate - *that* does get more stunning when you realise he has a gay brother.
96. Yeah, in current year it's pretty weird to me personally. *"oh how backwards those people must be, yikes."*
97. I would argue that that position is a comforting delusion. Both the major parties have left and right leaning factions within them, which is why it is important to get to know your candidates. The fact that the Labor Left have come out in force insisting that the LNP's refusal to set a party policy on abortion should be interpreted as party wide support for the pro-life position is characteristic of this delusion. Indeed, just this week, a former union boss and senior ALP member gave a graduation speech arguing against gay marriage and abortion. The reality is that Labor's core still includes a staunch Catholic membership. It is difficult to reconcile 'very telling where their beliefs lie' with party platforms, devised in private, behind closed doors for the sake of appearing unified.
98. If you think your civic duty is properly discharged by walking down to the polling place, marking a piece of paper and putting it in a box, then I think you misunderstand what I mean by lazy voters. The best electorate is an informed and engaged electorate. Informed doesn't mean collecting a pamphlet off the guy campaigning at your local shops. Engaged doesn't mean just answering the door and saying hello to the people in colour coded shirts. An informed and engaged electorate know their candidates beyond the colour tie they wear to official events. The ALP know that most voters can't be bothered, which is why party policies work for them. They can then concentrate on putting diverse looking people on the ballot and hope that it attracts voters from different backgrounds based on familiar look. If you can't even rank your preferred party candidates without resorting to random allocation you are an uninformed voter.
99. If you hear “same goes dick nose” and think “that sounds angry”, you’re a fool. Just curious, are you in a city electorate? Where I live voting for the greens has about as much impact as drawing a dick on the ballot paper. Your initial comment very much is tribal btw, “I voted for the tribe with fuck all electoral prospects” doesn’t really change that.
100. I don't know - how much was paid to him?
101. Dirty socialism, hey? ;)
102. I can tell you don't work in government :)
103. So what type of corruption would it take for you to start giving a fuck?
104. There's not really anything that can be done, but what he has done is immense. The closest would be the proposal to have state run petrol stations, forcing them to actually compete. As for Colesworth not price gouging? Get real. Our entire supermarket sector is totally controlled by 2 companies, with no opportunities for competition. ColesWorth bought land suitable for supermarkets not to build on, put to prevent competitors from entering the market. Kaufland had to abandon its Australia expansion because of the lack of suitable locations.
105. > spending $50B on renewables It's an investment not a spend. Power is something that underpins the economy you need to make it work and be affordable. Coal/gas in the long run will cost more anyways due to old infrastructure needing to be replaced anyways so I don't get your issue about the money here. And "gifting" to the power companies? Are you absolutely certain the money isn't going to Qlders and not going to help in any way? edit - where tf did you even get that $50billion number anyways, it wouldn't be even in one year as well ? Probably will need more investment than that anyways haha
106. Have you never been to North Qld?
107. also agreed, definitely need to know the person you are voting for however if they are a member of a party that was founded on core beliefs that are incredibly against my own beliefs then It'll be a massive red flag for me and an incredibly strong reason not to vote for them, regardless of what horse-trading or 'make the party better' arguments they put forth.
108. No one said people’s civic duties starts and ends at voting. You can’t make people being engaged in political process. I’d say the can’t be bothered camp votes both ways. Fun fact, on average Left wing voters with liberal views on average have higher IQs.
109. What's with the personal attacks? Sure sounds angry to me! Na it's not tribal you're just desperate for it to be tribal or your whataboutisms are invalid. Greens actually have a shot in my electorate so swing and a miss on that one as well.
110. No sir. I work in the real world where I have to be productive to earn a living.
111. Corruption of public housing building will get his blood boil, assuming this account isn't yet another Russian bot attempting to stroke division and spread misinformation in Queensland society.
