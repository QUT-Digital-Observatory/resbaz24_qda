Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. This is good news to anyone who wants to hear it. Tried having this convo with my grandparents their response is "anyone who is stupid enough to do drugs deserves the consequences", so it's not about science or harm reduction, it's about inflicting as much damage as possible to those you think deserve it. That was my takeaway, anyway. Love the Vietnam generation. Wish they were more sensible and progressive
2. LNP voters see drug users as sub human. they would like them to all die
3. Any party that's uses we believe in a statement to change legislation shouldn't be in a position to affect it
4. As someone who is firmly on the right on most issues, this is not one of them. The “war on drugs” is stupid, and has done little to nothing to stop drug use, so education and testing is a far better approach. I party a lot, and use the service at Bowen Hills regularly to make sure me and my friends are safe.
5. LNP " None of our white christian people do these drugs so why do we care! let them all die" Labor/People with humanity " Wtf LNP!"
6. This isn't an unintended consequence.
7. Well, that's the final nail in the coffin for the LNP. We're meant to be progressing as a society, not go backwards, you DC's.
8. The LNP are not the brightest people in the electorate. They just want all of us to look up to them. Because reasons. Uncosted illogical untested reasons. And they want our money.
9. Wow
10. Lnp destroy everything they touch it's common knowledge
11. I have been both an official and unofficial pill tester at festivals etc for over 30 years and can honestly say that the vast majority of punters when told their gear is bunk or adulterated will still neck them any way I'm not saying its a great policy to drop just stating from experience the harm reduction effects are often over stated (and the harm a lot of the time too)
12. This whole system is a fRIGGING joke. Do we support this? Do we agree to throw kids in jail at 10 or 12?? Do we take away more human rights, ban abortions Do we drug the masses?? Wtf!!!! They're all the same i vote anarchy !!!!
13. Like the ALP juvenile laws. How many people have been killed in their own homes where they should be safe?
14. But if you tell them they have a coffee addiction and they should ease up it’s the classic I don’t have an addiction I don’t need it I like it. A generation of hypocrites
15. Yet they do cocaine lmao
16. The highest cocaine use is in right-leaning suburbs.
17. Odd, as many of them (appear to) love alcohol - which itself is an extremely dangerous liquid poison linked directly to many societal, health and crime issues.
18. Same way they see the unemployed and students and those who are chronically unwell or hungry, and the working class , people who want to control their own reproductive rights, women, the marginalised, the refugees, and First Nations people . LNP are awful
19. So it’s a feature, not a bug.
20. It’s not just people with humanity… Everyone uses “drugs”. Every “drug” has the potential to be (silently) abused, and cause problems. … just look at alcohol, for example.
21. > I have been both an official and unofficial pill tester at festivals etc for over 30 years Ok I'm going to ask - what is an unofficial pill tester? Do you take a lick or a nibble, see what happens, and hand it back? I know that official pill testing includes actual analysis but I'm now very curious!
22. In those roles, what was the actual process? My understanding is the recent government funded program is based on overseas models like in the UK. The core aspect is people getting the opportunity to sit down and actually have a conversation about drug use with health professionals.
23. >They're all the same No, no they're not.
24. You tell us
25. If they're boomers they likely drink more than any of the young people they know
26. Coffee, ALCOHOL, gambling, tabacco. A generation of hypocrites.
27. dont forget alcoholics
28. Of course, they only don't like drugs when the poors do it. Those people are bad and should be punished. They know for certain that they'll never be policed about their drug use, because they're not poor. These laws don't impact them in the slightest, so they support them.
29. yeah hipocracy aside, you know what I mean. "druggies"
30. many arent capable of entertaining that kind of thought. one of them is legal. the other is illegal (in their eyes)
31. yeah there's a reason bottle shop's remained open during lock downs!
32. bunch of crybullies istg
33. Early days we just set up using eztest kits and when mass spectrometers became dirt cheap from ebay it was a game changer
34. No one is wasting their time at a music festival talking to a doctor or scientist unless they are already munted
35. Man I don't like alcoholics.
36. > One of them is legal. the other is illegal (in their eyes) Nope, not just in their eyes, in the eyes of the law.
37. Essential services.
38. Tax collection
39. I think your experience in pill testing over the past 30 years is different to the modern evidence based model being implemented. It be should rolled out for a period of time to determine if outcomes improve. The LNP dismantling it now helps no one.
40. As someone who goes to a lot a festivals, and talks to hundreds of people on drugs, MOST of them (normally 18-23) would still take the drugs even if they aren’t what they thought they were. Most people over that age will not use them.
41. A lot of younger recreation users do in fact use pill testing kits..
42. True, but that's why the long-term solution is education to change the culture. Those interactions with health professionals is the only opportunity young people have to engage in an honest, informed, and consequence free conversation about drug use. They can't access that with family, friends, teachers etc. The feedback from overseas models is young people are surprisingly upfront and genuine in these interactions.
43. I didn’t say they didn’t?
44. I’m not disagreeing, I’m for pill testing, I use the service a lot in Brisbane. But, younger people, generally, will take the drugs either way (mainly speed/meth found in “ecstasy”)…… mainly as they can’t afford to throw them away.
45. No you didn't, but in my experience, if they're testing their gear, they'll also not take it if its something dodgy. Of course you'll still get those that don't, or those that buy from randoms and take it without checking, but with a lot of younger users buying from the darknet, it's become a lot safer. I read a report about the rare of dangerous adulterants in party drugs having decreased with darknet market use increasing. Sellers actually have a vested interest in not cutting their gear with alternatives since they either won't get paid, since the payment is kept in escrow, and the risk to their business from bad reviews
46. I know how the darknet works lol. Problem is; the majority of users are NOT buying from the darknet, they are buying it after it’s been touched a few times, drunk, while they are out. Anyway….. pill testing is important. Stay safe.
47. Seriously, the flood map is an incredible resource - especially for those who haven't lived in Brisbane forever and a day, so don't know by memory what's prone to flooding and what's not.
48. "... While others will be reclassified to reflect... An increased risk of flooding" . Alternate headline: "UP TO 7000 BRISBANE properties are about to be reclassified as flood prone or at risk by the BCC"
49. Sure we’re on floodplains, but our stormwater system sucks. Council needs to stop giving hand outs to developers and make them fund the required stormwater infrastructure.
50. Oh, well that's a bit concerning... My house went from light blue to dark blue. Good thing I have flood insurance, and am moving out at the end of next month 😬
51. Increase house valuations = increased land valuation = more land tax = more monies! Win win win! Hydro modelling would of been watched by the government.
52. Thanks for sharing this!
53. Thank you for sharing! This is actually useful content and not just politics spam!
54. The thing that stands out for me on Brisbane's flood map, is how much of Brisbane doesn't flood.
55. The link to the updated maps doesn’t look like it shows what’s been updated, any ideas?
56. These flood models are still being presented using current day scenarios in terms of statistical rainfall and mean sea level figures. The council has run scenarios based on 2050 and 2100 scenarios reflecting the impacts of climate variability. The results are in the reports but not reflected in either the planning scheme or the online flood awareness map tool. So there are developments being built today designed on current day climate scenarios that with the full knowledge of future scenarios will not be up to code and at flood risk. Not including these in the city plan or even available in the flood awareness maps is short sited. I should say, any update of these models is positive and based on the latest information and technology. But they should be presenting the full suite of information.
57. Won't make a difference to insurance premiums, I take it. While I live in the Ipswich area, our home is at least 500 meters from the Bremer River, overlooks a park that would act as a reservior in a major flood event, and is elevated at least 4 meters above road level when you factor the slope on the property. Yet, our home is still classified as being a "flood risk".
58. I 100% believe this sort of data should be a living document, regularly re-assessed, but the problem with Council's track record is I can never trust that the assessment isn't somewhat influenced by where influential developers are planning a project.
59. Doesn’t mean they won’t flood 😂 whats that new way to steal the peoples money now ?
60. Was really good for me moving from Logan to Sandgate. Never had to deal with potential flooding until now
61. Including all of Rocklea.
62. The best stormwater infrastructure is open green space. Turning a 100 year old concrete drain in Stones Corner into Hanlon Park helped prevent major flooding in 2022. As well as being able to absorb more water, the reeds slowed the flow of water. Meanwhile, flooding upstream at Annerley where it's still a concrete drain was worse in 2022 than in 2011.
63. Next owner or won’t have it or will pay a leg every year to keep it. How do you see the change? I thought (by reading the article) it would only be released December.
64. They have learned nothing from any of the big floods. The completion of Wivenhoe Dam was used as an excuse to take a lot of properties off the post-1974 flood map. Many of them flooded again in 2011.
65. I don't think it's that nefarious. More likely that modelling simply spat out the result that it wasn't worth the upkeep of maintaining those 1000 properties on the overlay given likely flood conditions, than some kind of deep-seated conspiracy to take flood-prone properties and declassify them in order to increase stamp duty.
66. Read the post and not the headline. 8000 properties affected, of which 1000 removed. So it could be 7000 properties at increased risk. Based on previous models and recent floods it's quite likely they will be documented as being more at risk
67. would *have (in case you are interested). Or *would've, if you prefer the contraction. You're welcome.
68. Do council receive the land tax though? I assumed it went to the general revenue of the QLD government. I’m sure the increase in land value will increase council rates, though.
69. They’re being released in December
70. The science behind climate change is very much in its infancy. Engineers and their clients know that they have to allow for it, but it's not clear what to allow for. If say that the maps and codes allow for a 1% increase in the rainfall and it actually ends up at 2%, or 5%, then the authorities would be criticised for not allowing enough. So, map the now, have a stab at what might happen in 25 or 75 years and report on it accordingly. (just thinking... the City Plan could require DA to address climate change as well... maps could show as potential future risk...) Bottom line: Brisbane is built beside a river that floods. If you want to avoid flood risk then don't build by a creek or the River. Good read: [A River With a City Problem ](https://www.uqp.com.au/books/a-river-with-a-city-problem)
71. It is though? Council have a rolling, ongoing program to regularly review and update their flood modelling and flood mapping. That’s what this update is about…
72. You’ve got this exactly backwards, developers treat these maps like gospel so they don’t lose their assets to a flood during construction and because flood zones directly inform the construction standards that will be used, which all parties involved are interested in doing as accurately as possible.
73. * Rocksea
74. Agreed but unfortunately the only thing Council knows to do with greenspace is sell it off
75. Or the flood zones were done by computer and then people went around and said no, wait, that property has the house at the top of the hill and it will be fine.
76. Yes... and what I'm saying is that I don't trust there to not be a level of interference in the final findings, influenced by whose land is being assessed.
77. Seasonal water views
78. To their credit, BCC funded Hanlon Park. Covid put a stop to the next bit of the drain, then the 2022 flood happened.
79. That happens, though it's not that inaccurate. The ground surface is done off LIDAR mapping, which has a level of accuracy. The flood modelling simulates using a grid that could be small (say a couple of metres) to large (tens of metres) depending on how big the flood study is. If the LIDAR can't pick up the edge of a creek, then it might think the flood level spills over and onto the adjacent plains. Then engineers would ground truth and discover actually that the creek is deeper with a steep bank that's higher than the modelled flood level. This happened on a project I'm working on.
80. I mean that’s a pretty big stretch, they publish all of their flood modelling reports openly and all of the studies have been completed by reputable tier 1 engineering firms….
81. True we should give them that credit. I’m based near Milton where greenspace is cooked.
82. To be fair, they approved an old folks home in a known flood plain because the land wasn't otherwise in use...
83. I mean if it’s suitably designed to mitigate the flood risk then that should be ok? There is plenty of land around the place that is otherwise not used or under utilised that could be unlocked with the right design.
84. Narrator: It was not.
85. Shame :(
86. im a swing voter, who ever makes the most sense and is doing things for the communtity, thats who i have always voted for regardless of party, this year it will not be liberals getting my vote, fuck that noise, wants to take us back to the dark ages and suppress women, wants to wind back on drug policies which are proven to work, this guy wants to take qld right back to the 50's. Hard pass for me.
87. The sentiment of “oh the ALP have been in for a while” seems to be the only reason people can think of the vote them out. The state is transitioning to clean energy, they are using royalties to make peoples life easier in cost of living crisis, and Miles steps up when we had some natural disasters up north. Everything positive in QLD will disappear under the LNP, just so their donors can get more money and to ideologically appear to the cookers and creeps of the state. Channel 9 ran hit pieces of ALP every sunday after NRL about some bullshit youth crime problem. All it takes is a quick google search and crime as a whole is down, and youth crime is a problem in like North and Far North Qld, not the entire state. LNP will bring nothing but disaster to the state and I really really hope QLD, the smart state, does the smart thing.
88. I have heard and seen first hand that there is a lot of support for lnp outside of Brisbane area. A large employer for these areas is mining. The lnp benefits the mining industry for personal gain, which in turn supports the workers in that industry and gives assurance that jobs will continue. I think that beats a lot of what the labor seems to be running for eg public transport isn’t prioritised in these regions. A friend of mine who travels inland often spoke about ads saying how labor is shutting mines like Mt Isa- propaganda as that was shut by the company as it was too expensive to extract the deep coal. And although labor is better, they’re not exactly known for standing up to mining industry either. I’m sure there are many other reasons voting lnp appeals to a majority- this is just an obvious example to me
89. Why is everyone just waking up to how absurdly childish and currupt the LNP and their baked on supporters are? Regardless of who wins this election, Queensland has rapidly descended into case study to prove “ignorance is bliss”
90. Unless you are wealthy, own a home and don’t have a uterus, you’ll be fine.

93. I always base my vote on policy and what will have the best outcome for my family. We’re a young family on a single (ish) wage so obviously things like 50 cent fairs, energy rebates and free lunches will make an absolute tangible difference to our lives. Based on this we’re voting ALP However we’re in brisbane, we have easy access to schools, trains, infrastructure etc. I was speaking to someone who owns a business in cairns, they’ve been broken into 3 times and have had their car stolen so naturally when someone says they’re going to do something about it, it resonates with them. Youth crime while statically is going down, but it is a problem in some areas and is easy to paint an emotional response. You only have to look at the NT and the issues they’re having. Truth is there is no real easy solution, however putting the issue front and centre and speaking passionately about it is something that may resonate with someone who has experienced crime Not only that but there is also a bit of herd mentality with business and business owners. I cover a lot of “business networking” events and the common theme is LNP is good for business, even though this may not be factually true there seems to be this idea “if I don’t fall in line with my colleagues it’ll reflect poorly on me and my ability to run business” Finally I do feel that the majority of Australians aren’t just politically engaged. My old neighbour who is a cranky old lady told me that she can’t wait to vote out Albo this weekend. I think buy in large a lot of people just don’t care enough to look into it beyond slogans and vote how they always vote because of their parents or mates etc.
94. You vote for your local representative, not for Premier. Many dont seem to understand that.
95. Nope, and it's a joke LNP is leading their campaign with youth crime. It's even a bigger joke that there are people out there falling for it. Yes youth crime maybe an issue. But definitely not one that is greater than putting food on the table during theses tough economic times.
96. I’m usually of the opinion that no party should be in power for more than a couple terms at a time. But with the state government I’m willing to give that up because all the alternatives (bar maybe the greens) are just such absolute fucking wankers. How hard is it to just actually try to do good for the people rather than just yourself. Or to leave others people’s bodies the fuck alone. We are gonna be stuck with the lnp destroying the state for four years because people don’t like that Miles smiles.
97. Go to their website and read through the plan yourself if you're actually interested. My opinion is that the plan is better than Reddit makes it seem but it's still veryyyy light on details and trusting them in the job is a big issue. https://online.lnp.org.au/therightplan You won't get any positive response to this post.
98. I think he is perceived to be doing something about the youth crime "crisis" at least in northern bris that seems to be cutting through. The guy just seems like a slimy dickhead who couldn't give you a straight answer if it killed him.
99. Boomers and country folk will vote the lnp. Everyone else with half a brain will put them second last because one nation is on the ballot still somehow
100. David Crisafulli is 100% a scam artist and even worse than that he's a populist politician. He was also a senior minister in Newman's government and is on public record saying the Newman government was a good government. He's promised to significantly cut taxes including the royalties tax on mining companies so they can go back to stealing from us. Immediately this makes QLD billions of dollars poorer under the LNP. Which then begs the question of how he's intending to pay for his policies? Likely the usual LNP way, which is massive job and funding cuts to healthcare and emergency services. He's parading victims of crime around in his election campaign promising to be tough on crime by throwing children into adult prisons and then giving children criminal convictions that will stay with them for life. The issue with that is it will absolutely eliminate any chance these kids have at a positive interaction with the community and they'll likely never get a job once they serve their time. Part of me thinks this is deliberate by the LNP to turn these kids into life long offenders as they plan to privatize QLD prisons. Labor may not be perfect but they are objectively better than the LNP in almost every metric. This is proven by statistics and evidence especially in the area of youth crime. Which is significantly down. But the issue is voters are angry over the cost of living. And angry voters are stupid voters because all they want to do is get back at the government of the day even if it means making life harder for themselves by voting in a worse government.
101. LNP voters don't care. I was waiting for the ferry earlier and this really loud retiree was complaining to his mates about how this 50 cents fare and free school lunch don't make sense because they cost 10 billion and more debt to the government. "The green kids should fund it" is literally his words.
102. Electorally, Queensland is separated into two parts, the SE corner and Regional Queensland. Labor will be competitive in the SE corner because of their social and economic policies (think abortion, education, health, etc). The LNP will flip a lot of seats in Regional Queensland because they're perceived to be tougher on crime and in particular youth crime which has been a problem in North Queensland for some years. They also will slow Queensland's transition to renewables, promising more job security for mining communities up there. Overall, there also appears to be a sentiment in the Murdoch media that Labor's shelf life has expired which seems to have worked. I can only hope the tightening of most recent polls will give Labor momentum to seize a healthy minority in opposition but enough rope for Crisafulli to hang himself politically and make the LNP a one-term government here.
103. No, he wants to put teens and kids in jail like adults. Their behaviour is a reflection of their environment. The economy is fked and social media is promoting bad behaviour for clicks. The kids and teens need support and services, maybe early intervention classes in schools. The cost in living needs to go down too so their parents don't feel like they have to work constantly to keep a roof over their heads. Locking them up is just hiding the vulnerable and making them more dangerous. They will have no future.
104. I see it this way. Labor is shit. But they are less shit than the liberals. I can't think of one good thing the liberals have done in the last 10 years. They might have done good things, but nothing notable enough that i remember it. The greens, eh, they are shit too, but still less shit than liberals. The liberals appeal to the older generations, the rich, the people in good high paying jobs, and generally speaking people who vote liberal, their kids will too. They bank on future generations of voters doing the same as their parents. If they came from a privledged, rich family living in ascot, my money would be they are votiing liberal, their kids have only known a good life and their parents likely voted for howard and thought he was great.
