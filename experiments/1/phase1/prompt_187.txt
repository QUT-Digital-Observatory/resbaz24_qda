Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. The reported incidences may have decreased however the level of violence, weapons used & damage to life & property has skyrocketed. The Police catch them, the idiot Magistrates following weak Labor laws just let them straight out to do it again, and they DO. Adult crime, adult time. No more pussy footing with these repeat offender thugs.
2. What about repeat offenders?
3. Felt good putting labor 5th lower than the Greens and One Nation ahhh
4. Youth crime is unironically falling because of computers and phones.
5. ALP probably should have waited until after the election to talk about negative gearing amendments… no boomer offsetting their income with the 3 properties they bought for $100k each are going to allow that to be taken away.
6. Found this article and shared it with my sister who believes the 'oh no, let's lock up everyone because I fear for my house' hype pushed by the LNPs.
7. Then the issue is poverty causing youth crime, no? Policies that impact housing and food insecurity are going to impact youth crime. The issue is his solutions to youth crime is just detention and stronger penalties. Those don't touch the underlying issues which drive crime in young people.
8. This. Any chart that splits out Cairns and Townsville shows youth crime going up in those areas. And no surprises, that’s where the message of youth crime is resonating with voters, and where the seats look to be flipping.
9. Also, what is the crime being committed get parotted out and I do agree it's important information. I just don't see how anyone thinks prisons in their current form has ever helped anyone. And I get it's not about helping but punishing, I just wish it wasn't.
10. They don't care because it doesn't fit their narrative.
11. Where are you finding stats for regional Queensland? I can only find that the areas experiencing highest youth crime is Brisbane City not regional qld and the numbers of crimes have dropped. Can't find anything that show stats for regional areas only QLD as a whole. Would love to see.
12. I work in rural health across Qld and there is a serious lack of access to support for children in need, particularly around education, social and psychological supports. Once a child has committed crime, you have missed the boat.
13. Finally, I found a person on reddit who understands how the economy and it's performance have a direct relationship to crime. Well done sir.
14. This also is impacted by other factors though such as police resourcing. Cost of living pressures also drive both crime in general and youth crime as well.
15. It's not. \*Reporting\* of it in the local media, however, is through the roof. This is what has got people convinced that there is a crime wave- they keep being told there is, so they believe it.
16. They’ll say it’s getting better because our jails are full of low level offences such as first time drug possession ❤️
17. As an ex-foster kid, I hope so. I am keenly aware how fast that narrative can be pointed at us by gasbags in power.
18. The data is from the ABC chart.
19. Lol, most are usually released without any conviction
20. figuratively*
21. Someone to gaslight you by showing you stats and telling you it's because the news is reporting on it more so you think it's worse when it's not in 3...2...1...
22. Even the previous Major got away with killing someone with her car!
23. stop voting in conservatives who don't do anything to improve families lives. your problem will be sorted
24. But not wage theft and trading while insolvent.
25. What's the better statistic?
26. Totally agree. While I don’t agree with LNP’s “adult crime, adult time”. It’s so weird that people are being down voted because they are saying crime is noticeably worse where they live. My experience is crime is noticeably worse where I live in the Wide Bay/Burnett region and it’s more than just media coverage. It’s personal experiences or family & friends experiences (like car theft and business fronts being smashed) that I would have never imagined prior to 2020
27. The statistics are saying ALP has improved the LNP effort on youth crime by 30% in spite of increased ability for reporting youth crime, and substantial population increase.
28. I don't know what you think can be done about the 25% of parents who hate their kids and either abuse or neglect them entirely.
29. >weak wroooonnngggg https://desbt.qld.gov.au/youth-justice/our-department/our-legislation/changes-act https://www.utas.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/1223831/The-Purposes-of-Punishment-How-Do-Judges-Apply-a-Legislative-Statement-of-Sentencing-Purposes.pdf
30. 30% down Karen. 30%. LNP create crime, death and misery.
31. [removed]
32. Completely don't disagree. My point is that the places where this message works, crime *is* up.
33. Poverty is not relevant. The youth crime crisis is mostly children breaking into houses to steal a car for a joy ride. The spending on Indigenous services is extremely high but it hasn’t gone to the right places
34. [removed]
35. So is it up or not
36. https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/queensland-crime-statistics/# That's overall crime. I can't find the link that had youth crime specifically, but someone compiled it, with sources, a couple of weeks back.
37. Erh as someone who lives in regional QLD. There is definitely more crime. Local businesses constantly being broken into. Car theft. I know someone who had their car stolen. They were just getting out of their car in their driveway. It’s really based around motor vehicle theft. Grandma stabbed to death in front of her granddaughter in the middle of the day at a local shopping centre because of vehicle theft. Uber driver killed, again the guys were originally just attempting theft. I’m not saying I agree with LNP but it’s definitely noticeable the spike in crime in my regional area at least. I’ve lived here my whole life and it definitely was not like this prior to Covid.
38. No, actually I've seen the separated stats, independent of beat up. Since COVID there's been a sharp increase in crime and youth crime in Far North and North West regions. The increase is real, but the solutions are economic not legal.
39. Jails being full is how we get private prison, very lucrative in America.
40. You come live in Townsville and we’ll see how you go… crime may be down elsewhere but it’s worse here
41. Um what? Both Cairns and Townsville have had Labor representatives for years (until now), and Labor has governed in QLD for 30 of the last 35 years.
42. Ah yes, famous conservative bastion: Townsville
43. But why would they vote for the party who is literally denying what is happening?
44. Ok Tristan Barker
45. Crimes commited by type, violent, ect. legal reform isnt keeping the same community expectations from 30 years ago and changing the severity, but listening to communities to realise a red herring isnt real
46. Crimes per 100,000
47. Lol. Nothing to do with the hundreds of 000 phone calls that go unanswered, due to police shortages, or youth not being charged or recorded, except in the extreme, then let off
48. The stats are per capita so increased population shouldn't really play a factor.
49. So that's good enough then? Lets just leave it at that and stop trying to improve things?
50. Treating children like bikies=profit.
51. Thanks for sharing your fantasies.
52. Children who are bored because their parents are absent often due to work, or depression/alcoholism due to lack of work, especially in indigenous communities. You're really highlighting the failure to understand root causes.
53. *Using regression analysis, poverty, single parent families and crowded dwellings were found to be the most likely explanatory variables for juvenile participation in crime." From Household income, neglect and juvenile crime report https://www.aic.gov.au/crg/reports/crg-1795-6
54. Queensland has self defense laws solid enough to rival some US states with stand your ground laws. You have every right to "fight back" you just can't carry around weapons in public >.> You have every right to use a weapon to defend yourself if you believe your life is threatened. You just can't chase them down the street. It's really just tired and boring that people keep dredging up this "i can't defend myself" nonsense. You can. Edit: [Here](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-10-09/qld-alva-beach-stabbing-deaths-families-vow/100524446) Kid kills two larger, fully grown men with a knife and the coroner's report even throws into doubt whether the second guy even made it into his home. Kid wasn't charged because he acted in self defense.
55. ppffft lol no
56. Move to the US where you get less police protection and get to shoot your gun.
57. I live in Townsville. I agree and am making fun of the people who tell us our eyes are deceiving us.
58. ALP might as well be a conservative to me mate
59. can I have a statement from an ALP member denying North Queensland crime?
60. no idea who that is. your references must be as outdated as your views
61. Are you unable to read a graph?
62. Alleviating poverty, teaching kids about consent and providing a better environment for kids to grow up in will all help, not enough is being done and I absolutely endorse anything that helps.
63. Also bored because theres nothing for them. Even sports are hard once you get over the range, the distances for games ect. Its not an easy fix but arresting them all and charging as adults seems to be a terrible idea
64. 9 years of labour government in QLD, why have they let those roots dig in?
65. Thats a pre-social media report.
66. ah ok, i obviously can't read today ;p
67. Let me get you a tissue
68. The post literally represents the ALP with this data
69. They could’ve been charging for graffiti & now don’t…who knows. Stats can always be manipulated…violent crime committed by youth could be up, whilst underage drinking it down…who knows from such broad stats.
70. You just answered your own question.
71. It's only been three years of COVID recovery... That's where the spike began despite LNP nonsense.
72. no, it represents crime across the state of Queensland
73. Lots of assumptions in your comment/thinking.
74. the stats can be manipulated, but the news can't?
75. "ALP reduced youth crime by 30%" ....?
76. Never said it couldn’t - old mate was saying read the graph for the answer…depends on the question…
77. across the state of Queensland
78. Yep they just choose to show people the whole pitcure, this is from the report the graph is taken from. And the 2021-22 Queensland Crime Report showed a 13.7% increase in the number of children aged 10 to 17 being proceeded against by police, compared to the previous year. The total number of youth offenders reached 52,742, the highest number in 10 years.
79. Hey! we are getting it well done. Now back to the OPs point "city slicker stat. Come to Cairns and Townsville" He's suggesting this stat is worthless when there is huge crime increases in these areas, which is being ignored, because people are throwing this number out saying no actually crime is down. I mean the fact that this needs to be explained just means you are either really, really slow. Or disingenuous. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt Oh and if you want statements. Capalaba MP *Don Brown* claimed on Facebook that *youth crime* is all a "media beat up" But you can also just see the shilling posts on this sub daily saying that youth crime is down and not an issue.
80. So, I'm watching Channel 7 from outside Toowoomba for a few months last year and started to get really worried about the "youth crime crisis" that was reported nightly. I even considered buying a security camera. Then, one night, the head of police in Toowoomba comes on the news to say police data showed youth crime in the region had dropped by 20% over the past year. The news immediately returned to the presenter who, once again, said there was a "youth crime crisis". I then looked up the police data and saw youth crime (and other crime) had consistently fallen by 50% over the last 20 years. I hate being conned.
81. It’s the media, stupid. (No, seriously.)
82. Literally because the media keeps pushing the narrative that it is. Be cynical of news outlets. Question not just the story but WHY they're doing whatever story. They're very politically inclined.
83. Technically, the raw total number of crime victims *has* increased. However, during the same time frame, the population has also rapidly increased. And although more people, in terms of raw numbers, are being effected by crime (LNP lens); crime victims as a percentage of the total population, has actually decreased (Labor lens), and looking at it as a percentage, is largely agreed to be better metric. A reductive example would be like looking at the fake statistic that 1 person in village of 10 people is a victim of crime in year 1. As a percentage, 10% of the population is effected by crime. By year 3, 20 more people move into the village, bringing the total population to 30 people. Another study is done (by the LNP) and it is then found that now 2 people in the village are effected by crime now. The LNP\media narrative is technically correct when they say the ‘number of people effected by crime’ has doubled, or that the raw total number of people effect by crime has increased. But more examination is needed, because population has grown rapidly. Now 2 in 30 people are effected by crime (which as a percentage is only 6.67%). Ipso facto: the rate of crime in terms of the total population or per capita (per person) has actually decreased. It said that “Although artists use lies to tell a truth, politicians use the truth to tell a lie.” This is exactly what the LNP and their media allies are doing. They can technically spruik a truth “crime **numbers** (but forgetting to include as a raw total number) *are*, in fact, higher”. But in reality, it’s completely disingenuous. Because we all know most people would assume they mean crime as a percentage of the total population - which as I understand for Queensland population, has decreased. **TL;DR**: Although the raw number of people effected by crime might have increased, crime per capita has decreased (and is a more sensible metric).

84. There are maybe half a million people in this state outside the SE corner affected by increased crime rates in general (Mt Isa, Townsville/surrounds and Cairns/surrounds). This subreddit is mostly SE QLD where there isn't any change or spike in crime so lots of posts on here saying it's all made up. It doesn't help win people over by consistently gaslighting FNQ and NQ where there is an obvious spike in crime RATES. [https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/queensland-crime-statistics/](https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/queensland-crime-statistics/) I know my (labour) MP (michael healy) who I have spoken with on this issue (after sustaining multiple break ins caught on camera) is aware of the issues and equally frustrated. Youth are an easy target for media as well, but I have been victimised by kids and adults alike, predominantly theft, attempted robery, vandalism and threats of violence walking home from work. There are inadequate resources to deal with the issues up here. I think this is due to the nature of being regional and remote - it is hard to get the specialist services up in these areas and the cost to deliver it up here is too great for such a small number of people. The resources available in Brisbane and GC are much greater.
85. We are dealing with cookers. Try having an argument with one.
86. This happened a little while ago with the ‘ice epidemic’. Does anyone remember that? Media and politics painted a picture that drug use was so out of control and ice was taking over the suburbs and citys, but in reality the group of people actively using drugs was actually decreasing but the amount those who were actually using was increasing (probably for many factors but tolerance is a big one). I see this ‘youth crime crisis’ the exact same. Misinformation being skewed to paint a certain picture. It’s just fear mongering. If people did their actual research rather than buying into headlines we wouldn’t be falling for this crap. DV is a big one where reporting has significantly increased and our understanding as a population has improved in the last 5-10 years, but where is the outrage of this issue? People are so out of bent about a fake youth crime crisis but are not batting an eyelid over the countless women, children and men who are battling DV everyday. (PS very high majority young people who offend experience DV in some shape or form so maybe if we switch our focus *maybe* we might be able to help these kids from going down a life of crime, because let’s face it noone actually wants to be in and out of court and correctional facilities).
87. I have two mates in Townsville who have been broken into three times in the past few months. In all three cases items were stolen (car, electronics), the criminals either haven't been caught or when they have, they have been released. This is with security camera footage of youths with weapons, entering property etc. These events certainly makes it feel like in some parts of the state it is increasing. It's almost an unspoken part of being in North Queensland, a when rather than if, you will be burgled.
88. Statically it’s down state wide but you do have pockets in QLD especially in the north where it is a local issue. I do know people up in cairns who run businesses and have break ins, cars stolen etc. It is a genuine issue for regions like that. Couple that with some high profile cases, the Facebook group effect and you can easily paint it as an epidemic. At the end of the day, reporting on crime creates an emotional response. Especially when you give victims airtime. Statistics aren’t as powerful as a grieving woman. Mind you, it’s a complex issue. With deep seated social issues. The NT have being trying to solve it for years. The LNP are really kidding themselves thinking it’ll be fixed in 100 days
89. How about leave your soy lattes in the city and go experiment the beauty of the youth aboriginal crime in north Queensland? Then tell me if it's down.
90. The qld media has been fabricating youth crime waves since the 1800's, it's just a thing they bullshit about.
91. People say media but I disagree, media is following a trend of awareness. Today people are perpetually online regardless of age, they’re in Facebook community groups that give them access to thousands of peoples experiences, so when someone is impacted by crime, instead of being limited to the people they personally know, they have the ability to tell thousands of people at once. So instead of hearing about negative events from exclusively friends and coworkers, you hear about it from complete strangers. So people are more aware of the amount of crime, but are making a false comparison to their historical awareness, but without recognising that the primary difference is access of information increased, not the actual crime. I don’t blame folk for not making this connection. For example, last year we had an issue with Qantas cancelling a flight, then rebooking my partner, but not our one year old onto the next flight then tried to ask if the toddler could make alternative travel arrangements, I was able to post this to reddit and over a thousand comments generated. A decade ago I’d of only been able to complain to those I knew, a much smaller outreach
92. Because the small percent of serious offenders are committing serious violent crime, repeatedly.
93. I wonder if there is an increase in youth offenders being in presentence custody and or sentenced to detention?
94. LNP-leaning media, eg. Sky News, pushing an agenda. Here's a link of actual crime stats: [Queensland Police Service release latest crime statistics for 2023/24 financial year - Queensland Police News](https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/news/2024/07/26/queensland-police-service-release-latest-crime-statistics-for-2023-24-financial-year/)
95. Referred to as a Moral Panic. It’s essentially the media (in this case Murdoch owned) pushing stories that influence the public to believe a certain negative or threatening narrative. In this case it’s about youth crime which benefits the LNPs stance even though crime overall is down. More frustrating is their proposed hardline approach costs more on a dollar per person basis than preventative and rehabilitative programs do.
96. Basically the total number of crimes committed is going up because the population has increased. However, the number of crimes per capita is going down
97. Because the media, which is complicit with the LNP tells them.iy is and they can't be bothered looking at the actual statistics
98. What's happening? The news report exaggerated or even made up topics to create a culture war so you are less likely to care about real issues such as housing, and billions being funnelled out of Australia to oligarchs
99. because people don't often check on facts themselves
100. Yeah police just get sick of chasing, charging and watching them get set free, stop catching-stop the numbers
101. Depends on the measurement taken. Crime per capita might have decreased. But crime in total might have increased. All depends on how much the population has grown between results. It's one thing to say "crime has fallen by 20% per capita" but the population has increased by 200% (numbers I'm using don't reflect any actual data, just using as an example).
102. Because the media told them People are stupid.
103. Is it down evenly across the state? If I live in a 11th floor apartment in Brisbane with a secure basement garage my exposure to the kind of crime being talked about is very different to living in a Queenslander in Mackay. I genuinely have zero idea on the facts here and the media beat up is primarily a scare campaign but is there some aspect of some people’s lived experience making it seem like things are getting worse for some people in some areas, maybe? When you are the one who buys a dud product the fact that you are the one in a thousand who were unlucky is not much comfort when going through the refund process. Again I have no idea and no barrow to push but maybe there is some interesting story hidden behind the wall of BS the media are feeding us. Or maybe not.
104. Because there's hundreds of youths cruising around the local suburbs on stolen motorcycle. So it's very visual. They are also all repeated offenders, so the perpetrators are down dramatically, but the recidivism rate is much higher.
105. Because every day our town is getting smashed up by kids. Five years ago it was unheard of. They did three businesses last weekend, last night they did another. There were four stolen cars last night - full of kids - playing chicken in the traffic, half an hour away. So yeah.
106. Because the right wing my media is lying to get their christian nationalists into power. They are determined to bring in medieval oppression of woman. What the media now has access to, is people's Ring camera footage which they use to beat-up their bullshit. The privatization of government assets will be the reward. The rich get richer. The Christians get their totalitarian christan oppression of woman, Jews, Muslims and atheists. And youth crime reporting will immediately disappear from all news. You'll never again hear anything about youth crime while the LNP are in power.
107. Also lower policing rates. We have a policing shortage and a generation of young eshay punks who think public acts of criminal mischief are cool. A general society that defers responsible to an authority figure, however the authority figures have lost their mechanisms of control. Parents, schools and now police are all in a situation where they go "Well what do you want me to do about it. The kid won't listen or do what their told. Their out of control. There's nothing I can do about it." so now it is being passed up the chain of authority to the government and their response is pretty much the same.
108. Media taking confronting content from ring cameras and TikTok’s showing youths offending and mixing it with emotionally distressed victims who make sweeping statements that are reported as fact. Leaves viewers thinking the problem is bigger than it is, without fact checking anything. And if they do it’s an insignificant statement at the end of the segment/article. Classic misinformation stuff.
109. Because there has been a recent increase. More importantly FNQ is experiencing the largest increase making the population there acutely aware of the issue ABS There were 10,878 offenders aged between 10 and 17 years in Queensland in 2022–23, an increase of 6% (574 offenders) from 2021–22. After accounting for population growth, the youth offender rate increased from 1,863 offenders in 2021–22 to 1,925 offenders per 100,000 persons aged between 10 and 17 years in 2022–23. The most common principal offences among youth offenders were: acts intended to cause injury with 2,518 offenders (23%) theft with 1,794 offenders (17%)
110. Probably because there are more incidents but less of those result in a conviction.
111. Because Media is so concentrated - Kevin rudd has been trying to get a murdoch royal comission going for years. Murdoch owns almost all print media in QLD. When you are so rich that money doesn't mean anything you begin to purchase assets. Once that wealth is huge then the uber rich then want power to protect those assets. Musk bought twitter for this reason. Media monopolies are incredibly powerful as we can see. They manufacture or highlight a problem then their chosen politicians will push that they can fix it. A tale as old as time.
