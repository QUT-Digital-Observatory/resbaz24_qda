Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. There are medical conditions that have nothing to do with pregnancy or babies in general. Medical conditions for women who are NOT pregnant that they use the same procedure as an abortion for. This is what I am talking about. You ban one procedure, and that has ripple effects. For those of us who need a procedure like this because we are ill, are bleeding heavily for 6 months, in agony, have a condition that needs treatment etc and this procedure helps us - it’s amazing. It’s a medically necessary procedure. It has nothing to do with abortion or pregnancy. It helps combat an illness to do with uterine issues. However if you ban it for one thing, it cannot be used for ANYTHING. You are taking away the rights to anything to do with this type of treatment. Again - I’m not talking pregnancy here. I’m talking medical conditions that use the same procedure. If abortion is banned so are access to help women with these issues and there are many of us with them. Would you like your healthcare taken away?
2. Well technically it is a birth control.... Or murder
3. You're full of it mate
4. She sounds like she needs mental health support.
5. When will men take responsibility? It takes two to tango so what are YOU doing? What are men doing to prevent unwanted pregnancy. Answer the question. I don’t have an issue with abortion, I don’t have to do anything about it because I love abortion. I’m glad it exists. If I could have a job doing abortions every hour of the day I would gladly do it for minimum wage, hell, I’d do it for free on the weekends! It’s YOU who has an issue with it, so what are YOU doing to prevent unwanted pregnancies, other than being in celibate? I teach public health and sexual safety courses pretty often, actually. Whole fucking reason I’m in public health. So, again, you have such a problem, what are you doing to tackle the main cause of abortion?
6. If it takes two to tango, and you want to take away women's autonomy and choice as to when they have children - It's only reasonable we take away men's autonomy and make each man get a vasectomy until he is married and has permission from his wife to reverse and attempt to have children.
7. No I’ve got plenty to hand out to you weird religious folk who care too much about unborn children
8. Nice try. Of course I do. I am a woman who has had to fight for months for QPS to 'believe' me. I know better than most exactly how this numbskull idea would go, ya wanker.
9. Please remind sexual abuses to abstain.
10. He can still put forth a bill, you don't need a majority for that. Then the LNP could in theory vote any way they like on it, and we know what way 90% of them like.
11. Agree We say that with the covid mandate BS
12. Because they arnt doing it, you see the “medical experts” are telling porky pies
13. They listen to Trump and his moronic rantings about abortion up to the ninth month and after birth. They're as stupid as he is.

16. Legally? No that’s what this bill is for
17. >\>legally the present Guideline provides for the care of a baby born following a termination procedure, it does not contain, nor is it necessarily informed by, the force of law. the Guideline is merely that. Indeed, the disclaimer on the inside cover of the document states that the Guideline is “provided for information purposes only.” the present Guideline with respect to babies born alive came into effect in October 2023. Prior to that date, the clinical guidelines, with respect to any babies born with signs of life, recommended “not \[to\] provide lifesustaining treatment (e.g. gastric tubes, IV lines, oxygen therapy).” The amendment brings the Queensland law into line with South Australia and New South Wales.12 The Termination of Pregnancy (Live Births) Amendment Bill 2024 removes any doubt that a baby alive as a result of a termination of pregnancy procedure has the same right as any baby born in normal circumstances. This reflects the importance of equal treatment for all babies born in Queensland.
18. Maybe research it further
19. Late term abortions are almost always performed on wanted babies with catastrophic medical conditions that are incompatible with life. Babies who are born without kidneys, or with no brain - who can never live. This bill would mean that instead of being able to pass in their parents arms, will now spend their last/only moments of life having their ribcage broken by CPR, poked with needles, and given invasive and painful last resort care. And for what?
20. They have a majority of 1, with 10 seats still not called. It's entirely possible they end up with a majority of 6.
21. Except the LNP has an extensive history of blatantly ignoring public opinion to appease factional heavy weights. And the desire with the LNP to criminalize abortion again is overwhelming.
22. They didn’t say they wouldn’t do it, they said “it’s not their plan”. They specifically refused to answer this directly knowing full well that someone like Katter would introduce a bill for a conscience vote. LNP did this last time with civil unions. They said they weren’t going to touch civil unions but they did so in the very first week of Campbell Newman’s government.
23. There you go then. What's everybody worried about? They surely wouldn't go back on their word. After all, it's a 'Fresh Start' for them (according to the billboards) All I meant was that they're probably not going to give too many shits about public outcries. They never have before.
24. That's one of the most ironic comments I've ever seen, and that's saying a lot considering this is Reddit.
25. 'It can't be a part of the plan if we don't have a plan.'
26. Abortion hasn’t been illegal in QLD for decades. Even the link you posted explains the decriminalisation was regarding extremely old legislation. I easily got an abortion in Brisbane in 2011 & my aunty had a 3rd trimester abortion in the 90’s for health reasons. It’s really frustrating that people keep failing to demonstrate basic comprehension of what that decriminalisation vote was actually about. If Katter did introduce a bill to repeal that legislation it really wouldn’t do much in terms of access.
27. Thanks for sharing that. Good to see he says it directly in this instance. But I’ve heard so many LNP MPs use the very specific “it’s not in our plan” language and I know a number of very anti abortion people just got voted in. So I’m not sure I believe him. And we know how he’s voted in the past on this issue.
28. Yeah cause politicians always tell the truth and are the most honest bunch there is /s 🙄
29. The LNP are very good at explicitly going back on their word, though.
30. I can't believe you're being downvoted for providing evidence of the truth. I'd like to know why the mods aren't doing anything this fear mongering.
31. You said to vote for Pauline. That’s all I need to know about your thought process on politics in Australia.
32. What's wrong with them is they're allowed to vote. THAT'S what happened on Saturday. Qlders have short memories, short attention spans and shorter brains. And I know, I live there.
33. Hahaha nah the cunt is simply pro-life and just not very smart about how he presents it
34. [deleted]
35. The first time I saw a Dodge Ram with a giant Trump sticker on the back window in my suburb was almost as surreal as it was horrifying.
36. I didn’t know that, and shame on them. Doesn’t change the fact that the KAP are eyeing a rollback of abortion rights, the LNP are wittering on about it “not being their plan”, and too many people are content to dismiss the entire thing with “it’s not going to happen.”
37. Vasectomies are reversible. So, I spose we could make a law that men are responsible, control your bodies instead.
38. Cope?
39. What should they have kept banned?
40. Makes perfect sense to me thanks.
41. Not all LNP MPs are devout Christians who believe abortion is an affront to God. But they are all politicians. And shrewd politicians read the room. They are aware that this isn't the 1950s anymore. Katter can bring in a conscience vote, but it would fail when it came to the crunch I agree people have to be proactive on getting a point across that the majority of Queenslanders won't stand for abortion bans. My original comment simply stated that, looking rationally and logically, at the political environment and history, LNP MPs would be incredibly stupid to make such a gamble and risk another decade in the wilderness.
42. Just like any other politician in history I guess. Difference here being we don’t all go and preemptively protest something about that isn’t happening. Like do we preemptively protest the fact that we may not end up becoming a “renewable energy superpower” as promised by Albo?
43. [ABC and it’s left leaning ways too](https://amp.abc.net.au/article/104506014)
44. So you preemptively protest all the other shit the other teams say too then? They are all politicians. They are all as bad as each other obviously.
45. 1. So we don’t trust anything the other guys says too. Perhaps he was also going to ban them. 2. Oh I’m well aware. They also are incredibly weak and pointless at times too. We’ve stopped that war in Gaza pretty quickly. Protests though are actually excellent at dividing a nation too. Going further back on history, the number that have ended in bloody wars is high. (Obviously won’t be the case here but you talked about history of protests, so it’s relevant).
46. Its # 6 on the list buddy
47. Nothing is changing. Youve been brainwashed by labors propaganda machine.
48. You would have a rough time in Europe if you think Australians are overly political hahaha
49. We all learn things at a different pace, it's okay. If you were here during Campbell Newman's term you'd have realised we do in fact care about how our state is run. Or mid pandemic. Things have just been kind of boring as of late.
50. Sarcasm, or pride in ignorance and lack of knowledge? I'd bet pride, given how much this country props up and idealises mediocrity.
51. Look into it, what was done since the 70’s until 2018 in rape cases. Id be interested. As I stated money, timing and wrong partner account for the most abortions, medical is a very small amount as well. They are red herrings in pro-life debates, because those have always been legal anyway and I believe women have a choice in those cases. I could never tell a sick woman or rape victim what to do. All women need love and support in all cases.
52. You are a clown get the vax or lose your job is not choice without consequences.
53. No. ☺️
54. How is murdering the unborn healthcare?
55. >Do you really want me to quote all the times in history a politician said they won't do something, then proceed to do it? Sorry, at what point does it becomes misinformation to whip bases into a frenzy based on... Nothing? Politicians can break their word but you are aware that changing abortion access was not a policy of the LNP for this election? What are we even doing here? Note I generally support the current level of access to abortions.
56. High on life with an LNP majority
57. Yep
58. Yup its insane that this mob swallowed the labor propaganda hook line and sinker. Abortion was never unattainable and the law was never pursued. How long has the clinic in bowen hills been openly operating for? As long as I remember. Labor has some serious shit to answer for. They are a party of fear and they are clearly whipping up the crazies.
59. People are trying to get home after work.Why not a saturday or sunday when more people are likely to show up.
60. That makes no sense in relation to what I said.
61. Your words, it’s what’s for dinner https://assets.nationbuilder.com/wfa/pages/498/attachments/original/1670561421/Q_A_Fact_Sheet_Late-Term_Abortion_.pdf?1670561421
62. I get that. Apologies for the long response. I think in general Australians aren’t really educated on protests (which makes sense because protests are against governments in most cases). The unions used to lead a lot of protest movements but over the years this is much less so. Now media paints them as more ‘radical’, ‘ideological’ and ‘idealistic’. The mainstream rhetoric around protests needs to be called out because they are immensely more powerful than government wants you to think. It doesn’t matter if you agree with the cause of not, a politician is forced to pay attention to a protest. It costs money for policing, road closures, and indirect economic effects (e.g. buses running late so workers less productive that day). It causes nuisance (noise, hard to get around, makes people upset and annoyed like “it’s incredibly frustrating that there’s another annoying protest AGAIN, can they just fix this shit already”). And, *possibly most importantly* it gets people talking. Media might report on it (unless it directly threatens the media moguls), but without a doubt locals will be talking about it. Whether it’s to mention to your boss why you’re late, explain to your kid why people are yelling in the streets or whatever else. These conversations are opportunities to share experiences and educate one another. They also lead to politicians being questioned more intensely on the topic and occasionally force them to review their stance. We’re incredibly lucky to live in a country where protest is legal. However the rhetoric around peaceful protests that go against the state (e.g. anti-apartheid protests now and for South Africa) is becoming increasingly hostile. We now even see a ‘social democratic’ party like Labor with politicians calling for protests to be cancelled or heavily policed. Whether you agree with a cause or not, we must educate our kids on the power of protests and civil disobedience; so they too can use it when lives (and women’s healthcare) are at risk. [I recommend watching this 4 minute video on protest](https://youtu.be/c_g1BMVFcuw?si=R5Anu0r7essFeIxr) **Tldr** : protest invokes change through many direct and indirect means. Even the most hard-right government would have to pay attention. After all, protest is one of the first things to be criminalised by a dictator.
63. Comment respectfully. Continued harassment may result in you being banned.
64. It's an insult and is literally abuse. typical behavior.
65. Whys that?
66. [deleted]
67. Because 99.9% of women abort due to not wanting it. That’s why.
68. Exactly like a baby murder junkie would say
69. Being against child murder isn’t caring too much it’s basically the minimum
70. So they shouldn’t abstain? Didn’t have pro-r*pe on my baby killer bingo card
71. Based on what
72. It opens up medical professionals to be sued for all sorts of things, if a baby is not compatible with life, anti abortion groups will still sue and it will still be a burden on the people involved and the medical system. By throwing enough money at the situation litigators can effectively ban abortions.
73. We aren't the legislators. They are meant to legislate on our behalf, but they are trying to appease their imaginary sky daddy.
74. [Terminations for medical reasons](https://www.pinkelephants.org.au/page/71/what-is-tfmr) can occur relatively late in the pregnancy - some defects aren't detected until 19/20 weeks in. A termination after this point is often just the woman being induced to give birth. In very rare cases a 20-week fetus may survive delivery live briefly after being delivered, but won't survive long after, and the underlying medical causes that necessitated the TFMR remain. This legislation would force doctors to provide CPR to resuscitate - for example - a baby which has developed with no kidneys, or which is missing the part of its brain which tells the organs how to function, and is incapable of sustaining its own life. Effectively, this law prolongs the pain of the child and traumatises the parents. It's a concept which is copied from the US, where the Republicans introduced similar ["born alive"](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/03/the-facts-on-the-born-alive-debate/) laws to try to intimidate doctors away from providing necessary medical terminations. The law relies on people having a reaction like you're having in order to further restrict necessary medical care. The writers of this legislation are literally imposing further suffering on an already horrific situation just to win votes.
75. you don’t understand how “born alive” abortions work the fetus isn’t viable and will not survive outside the womb, the baby (usually desperately wanted and loved) will die, sometimes in its grieving mothers arms, it will not survive, it is inhumane and incredibly cruel to try to resuscitate a non-viable fetus, this bill will do NOTHING but force clinics to stop offering second trimester abortions from fear of persecution, it will do nothing but force women to carry babies that won’t survive, and puts the mothers at a much, much,much higher chance of severe complications or dying. these abortions aren’t change of mind abortions, these are the abortions that have to happen to save mothers, and creating legislation that puts mothers and providers at risk of persecution will only make them harder to access.
76. I quoted The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG), because they are qualified medical specialists in this field. The architect of the *Termination of Pregnancy (Live Birth) Bill* were Christian Hard Right Anti-Abortion activists such as Joanna Howe and 'Cherish Life.' Hence, the description in the Bill is inaccurate (and I'm being incredibly generous).
77. Don’t bother. I had an argument with someone last night about this on here and they wouldn’t even be open to adding into law providing palliative care to a baby born alive after a failed termination. It sounds like basic human decency to do so, but people link it to taking away abortion rights (which from my understanding is not what this is about at all in terms of the legislation). It is essentially a legal guardrail anyway for the people who believe it isn’t happening. Why not just legislate to prevent any suffering that could even be remotely occurring? When I mentioned that it was already a thing in NSW and SA, I just got heavily disliked and they moved on.
78. Ol mate up there already told me all I needed to know. Can you disprove it??
79. Except that’s not true
80. You make a good point there. It just shows how nuanced the issue is. I do know of someone who aborted late stage (Down Syndrome) and ended up with this situation. Again, I don't know all the details, but it didn't sound like something I'd choose.
81. 'Their Plan' is to wait for KAP to retable their bill, then 'allow' a conscience vote on it, which will get it to pass. it's extremely dishonest.
82. A couple literally went to court in 2010 charged with procuring an illegal abortion. It’s great that you were able to access the care you needed but no need to downplay serious concerns. Criminalisation of abortion makes it more difficult for doctors to know where they stand which inhibits access - more doctors simply don’t want to offer the procedure if the legality relies on a grey area. We do not want to go down that path.
83. Your experience is not at all representative of a lot of other people's experience. Decriminalisation also means ease of access, reduced cost, less stigma etc. The way you've presented this is really disingenuous. There is a shit load of research out there you can access on all the reasons why the original reform was needed, and why going back would be a catastrophe
84. Fuck off. It’s beyond frustrating that we have to argue about abortion in 2024. Your story is one of success, but the rest of the state exists. When abortion is illegal, it’s not so easy for the hundreds of thousands of other people to just pop down to the SE and get an abortion from a sympathetic doctor. Think outside your box.
85. you are factually wrong. It was decriminalised in 2018.
86. The abortion vote won’t pass the private members bill.
87. Same can be said about people on Reddit
88. It's probably the mods using alt accounts... What's hilarious is the left have been banging on about 'misinformation' since their disastrous referendum failed, but they themselves engage in it incessantly.
89. OR GREENS you absolute fucking moron. Jesus Christ were you born this stupid or did you hit your head at some point?
90. Hence my question to them, dude. "What the fuck is wrong with you?" I know they'll never actually respond to reason but I can't help but check now and then. Sucker for punishment.
91. Disgusting troll
92. My exact point. Condoms exist so does birth controll for women. You dont want a baby maybe use those instead of doing the thing that creates babies and hoping for no baby.
93. Sure, incredibly stupid, but still very possible. I am an American/Australian and vote in both places, so I will say my perspective is skewed. I fully accept that. But the American experience is important here, because American style politics is absolutely infecting the LNP right now. The U.S. Republicans fought for a generation to roll back abortion rights and they won that. It also caused them electoral problems, probably helping to blunt their wins in 2022. They are also still having to deal with the fallout right now in the current election. They did that even though it would be unpopular for most Americans because they believed that abortion is murder. And when you truly believe that abortion is the literal slaughter of defenceless children, your logical decision making becomes short circuited. The QLD LNP might be smarter and better politicians than the American Republicans, but I really doubt it. I mean look at what they did the last time they were in power......went through QLD society like a wrecking ball. We can hope they learned from that but I bet what they really learned is to get as much done in a term as possible before they are turfed out again. All that said, I hope you are right, but I am not being complacent and comforted. The only way to ensure they don't is getting out and protesting, making lots of noise, and making it incredibly clear that they will be punished deeply if they make the change. Even then I am not sure it will be enough. As you said, we need to keep that opposition forefront in their minds. >They are aware that this isn't the 1950s Yes, but they WANT 1950's morality, and have watched bans succeed in the U.S. They want what Florida and places like that have right now, not just in the 1950's.
94. "*Like do we preemptively protest the fact that we may not end up becoming a “renewable energy superpower” as promised by Albo?*" Yet thats becoming true especially if we don't have idiots like Crusifulli removing Major pumped hydro projects for no apparent reason. if we stick to the plan that is laid out by the AEMO, it will be achieved all without requiring Nuclear or any other fantasy technology.
95. how are your mental backflips this strong? how can you see someone refuse to answer a simple question on a conscious vote so many times and simply think "yep nothing wrong with this seems legit"
96. Can you point out where he says something to the effect of "If KAP put a vote to the Parliament, I will instruct the party room to vote No"?
97. No, I actively distrust any politician's promises.
98. Why would they change something they've supported for years and never questioned it? On the other hand the other party didn't answer the question until asked over 100 times. Yeh you can keep reaching in regard to the protests and choosing what points suit your narrative.
99. How much are they paying you to lick their assholes? I believe I could do a better job than you. At least I could make logical arguments, not weird twisted ramblings disguised as "intelligent" debate. What's the rate?
100. I was extremely sick in my first pregnancy. Bed bound. I had horrible hyperemesis gravidrum which is extreme morning sickness. I was already 47kg and was down to below 40kg. I was offered a termination so many times but I so wanted my baby. I was lucky my partner could pay the bills and my work was supportive. However if my second pregnancy was like that I’d have no choice other to terminate as I’d have nobody to watch my child whilst I was in hospital. My partner needs to work to pay for food and mortgage. Thankfully I had normal sickness and not bad hg. I’m on a hg fb group and most of the women have to get abortions because of lack of support. Work doesn’t support them, can’t be in hospital because they have other kids. It’s heartbreaking. I don’t believe most are due to these reasons. Pregnancy especially in first trimester is so difficult. Second pregnancy I had gallstones which is common but wow was painful and can’t get surgery - as pregnant . The amount of illnesses due to pregnancy would be the reasons of termination in my opinion. There’s no support for women when unwell and pregnant. You get told oh that’s common. Normal. Being sick off your work. Having other children to look after. Men won’t ever experience it so shouldn’t tell women what to do. And from what I’ve heard from friends who have had medical abortions, it’s extremely painful, horrific cramps and bleeding. So I’m sure women don’t make these choices lightly so men should keep their opinions to themselves.
101. She didn’t lose her job. I guess hers is just more important than yours since you lost your job? Must be easily replaced huh? The uneducated are usually easily replaceable
