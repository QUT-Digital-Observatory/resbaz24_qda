Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. If that’s what you can afford, the best time to buy land is yesterday. I imagine a lot of FHB are in your shoes looking at areas like this and as more owner occupiers move in the area will improve. Millennials and gen Z are a massive demographic that are looking to buy their first homes from now for the next 15 years at least, so I’m predicting demand for anything urban and affordable (I’m using that term relatively) is only going to go up. If it’s an investment you plan to live in, freehold is almost always going to give you both a better return and a better lifestyle (if you’re a family) than strata. Plenty of people will disagree with me and promote apartment living but the Aussie dream has always been house and land and while I agree that will need to change eventually, it is always going to be something that families aspire to and it won’t change in the lifetime of any adult alive today. Check that it doesn’t flood and get a good building and pest, then pay an extra couple of grand for a high fence and good quality security system + crimsafe. Then rest easy knowing you bought a solid investment early, instead of waiting to save for ‘something better’ and getting priced out.
2. When I started uni I moved into a set of units near the train station. The day I moved in there was a murder at the top of the street. I only lasted 6 months before I had to get out of that shit hole.
3. Can't speak to the accuracy of this site as I just found it doing a quick search on google but it makes for interesting reading. [https://redsuburbs.com.au/states/qld/](https://redsuburbs.com.au/states/qld/)
4. First home my parents bought after I was born was in Woodridge. We lived there maybe 8 or 9 years? Had good neighbours and most of the people nearby were good too. No crime issues during that time. Think it deoends which part and who is around you. We were deep in the suburb part, not close to the train station or shops where the issues tend to be.
5. That pocket has had the most growth in SEQ, in the last few years. Can’t be that bad.
6. Eagleby, Marsden and Morayfield take the cake for me
7. There’s certainly a lot of trash people there. Especially at night. Drunk aboriginals behaving badly are a norm, big fights periodically with other groups. Melting pot of cultural trash mixed in with people just trying to live their life. Avoid if you can. Insurances will be sky high
8. If you don't buy there someone else will,gentrification is inevitable there.
9. I grew up around there(for 20 years), and still have friends that live there. It is that bad, but it's like most bad suburbs there are pockets of better places. unless your house is known, or you make it not worth the effort (fences, dogs and locks), you will get broken into. There is violence and drug use but 95% of that is self contained and won't normally affect you, but don't go out at night. Public transport can be a bit iffy.
10. Yeah this is key really, your neighbours will be the difference. There are good and bad pockets, I think the gentrification of Woodridge may be a little slower given its kinda a little satellite city so the druggys will around for longer. In the same way I believe Eagly will become gentrified faster than Beenleigh for the same reason. I think you'll find if you are away from the CBD area there it be more conducive to a quite environment and potentially less crime. A dog and some sensor lights go a long way for deterring people.
11. Do you think it’ll slowly (5-10 years) become more popular and increase in value?
12. Nah far from worst in the state - not even in SEQ, parts of Ipswich are way worse. It’s shit don’t get me wrong, but it’s actually less shit than it was 10 years ago.
13. Yes it’s really that bad? Do you have experiences at all?
14. They are so expensive now
15. I'll take my apartment with courtyard in the inner suburbs over a crack shack in Woodridge any day. The Aussie dream of a house and land comes at the cost to your quality of life. Kids can play at the local park without worrying about stepping on a needle or getting shanked.
16. What a load of rubbish.
17. Yes, in the last 5 years there are many areas in Logan that have doubled in value. There is nothing wrong with being a FHB and buying and living in Woodridge. Just avoid the local shops, have a home security system and look at owning a dog. Owning your own home in Woodridge is far better than renting in another suburb in the long run.
18. I don’t think Woodridge specifically will. Some other areas in Logan have increased.
19. Just bought in Ipswich, I’m sure parts of it suck but where we are is very family and quiet. People who say Ipswich sucks have never really spent time in Ipswich
20. Ipswich itself is nice, but I wouldn't walk the streets in some of the surrounding areas. I agree outside SEQ you'll find much worse conditions. Start with Mt Isa.
21. I live / grew up in Shailer Park and I’ve been through there lots of times during the day and night and it always just feels dodgy. Less so during the day but I’d never want to live there.
22. Disagree. I get to go to the worst parts of all areas in Brisbane, Logan and Ipswich as a paramedic. The worst of Ipswich is the worst. I’d sooner go to the Woodridge crack den than the Goodna crack den. I didn’t say all of Ipswich is awful just like not all of Logan is awful. But the bad parts are bad.
23. oh you're talking about the suburbs between brisbane and Ipswich that are part of the Ipswich LGA. I moved to Ipswich city and suburbs (I guess), it's fairly nice here, I wouldn't go near the bad spots in goodna or redbank though. Passing through there on the train is enough to convince me the extra 10-15 min travel to Ipswich city is worth it.
24. I think you mean public servants.
25. Any views on when we’re likely to find out the new DGs? I know Mike Kaiser is gone but who else?
26. https://preview.redd.it/ozlcytzaugxd1.jpeg?width=752&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=66ca056cff510c4851135b633cec7607d5097e53 Saw this in fb - email from Premier to all qld gov staffs.
27. Public servants are not the same as contractors
28. [Queensland public service adds 11,700 workers, corporate roles growing at faster rate than frontline - ABC News](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-06-11/2024-qld-public-service-data-released-frontline-corporate-rise/103961864)
29. I did. Thanks.
30. Once the cabinet is sworn in, so the next couple of days.
31. This concurs with what an LNP affiliated QG staffer told me last week, no way they will anytime soon. They still have to install all the jobs4boyz yet
32. I received this in my gov inbox too so the FB post is true. TBH the only evidence I’ve seen of them doing mass cuts is that they did it before, but that was under different leadership, in a different time and very much affected their outcome in the next election. However, my role is very much in the air but that’s for more complicated reasons personal to me (smaller departments get moved around and merged like nothing).
33. I still don't believe them. SEQ water is technically a statutory authority, not public service according to google. About 1000 people. They got hit last time. I'd hate to be working there or any other place similar now.
34. No it’s not cuts, it’s Right Sizing (tm).
35. I sincerely hope so, but I’ve seen promises like this before.
36. Bligh padded the public service when she saw the writing on the wall too.
37. I won't be suprised if they let the public sector attrit itself at first. Seen it done before. "We're not firing anybody - we just aren't hiring anyone to backfill retirements and redundancies.."
38. I've seen promises like this in corporate, but not from the Premier immediately after an election. Of course it could be a lie (or a non-core promise), but given what happened to Newman after his cuts, and the current economic and social situation, I always suspected that they wouldn't pursue such an agenda. If they do end up making those types of cuts then, given promises like this, the voters will be *even more* furious than they were with Newman, and the LNP would be banished for another decade or more. So I take it at face value.
39. The Taliban said they'd let girls go to school too.😅
40. Not a liberal supporter but he doesn’t need to promise anything now
41. Outsourcing then redundancying isn't direct firing, Have to pay for the Olympics somewhere.
42. More outsourcing, which ultimately costs more. And knowledge loss.
43. There is also this classic Four Corners episode https://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-08-08/the-moonlight-state—1987/2832198
44. I recommend the books by Matthew Condon "Three Crooked Kings 2013, Jacks and Jokers 2014 and All Fall Down 2015" and the follow up Little Fish are Sweet. Apart from the history I found myself checking up on the places he writes about.
45. The place to start is a book called "The Hillbilly Dictator" Should answer most of your questions.
46. Pig city by Andrew Stafford focuses on brisbanes music history and touches on it a lotZ
47. Matthew Condon’s trilogy of books about Crime in Qld in the 80s are pretty good. Things like the Hillbilly Dictator are pretty old now - we could do with a new appraisal of the Joh years.
48. /me trying to understand what the fuck “Boomer History” is
49. https://youtu.be/vq0txTl1PDY - Check out Mr M History here. I think there's also a podcast companion to this video on his spotify. Edit: Found it here https://open.spotify.com/episode/3jw0dReP9Fy8nKnwOLZJ8v?si=kpPUoLtzRIOlzoAHexajcw
50. Since ‘boomers’ and early Xers were the ones living through it, it makes sense that they are the ones telling the story. Anything else would be anecdotal surely.
51. Check out "My Experience of the Joh Years: A Gen Z Perspective" by WTF Are Uon.
52. You will also want to read up on Fitzgerald which will give you a lot of context for some more recent history like the reaction to Newman, specifically the association laws they brought in for bikies. For anyone old enough it was a callback to the anti protest laws Joe had in place to break up groups of people that they didn't like. If I remember correctly any group of three or more could be considered a protest and broken up by the police.
53. Joh, by Hugh Lunn, is a great read. I’ve also read Joh’s autobiography which was interesting.
54. Joh’s Jury was pretty popular when it came out.
55. Andrew Stafford’s “Pig City”. From a music perspective. I heard him speak the other day.
56. The Deep North by Deane Wells. *Analysis of the philosophical assumptions that motivate Queensland politicians - Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, R.J. Hinze, R. Joyner, K.B. Tomkins, and L.R. Edwards; includes mention of attitudes and actions regarding Aborigines.* It pretty much states that 'ol Joh was a totalitarian racist......among other things. IIRC the author was a Labor party member and also ran for a seat in Brisbane back in the early '80s.
57. Bjelke Blues is another great book on the topic.
58. Had a mate who's brother became a cop in the late 70s early 80s. When on the bear in Fortitude Valley was directed by his superiors not to answer calls or look into certain establishments
59. Yes, absolutely came in here to recommend this. Probably one of 4 Corners' most iconic reports and practically led directly to the downfall of the Bjelke-Petersen government. Also I don't know if this is the one I watched a while ago because youtube's search function is absolute rubbish now, but the ABC's 1989 election night coverage [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHXuUOpaTQQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHXuUOpaTQQ) also adds a great window into the past.
60. He has some fantastic podcasts as well. Ghost gate road & one of the dig series
61. Yes. This is so good! Except in the audio books, the person narrating isn't from Brisbane because the pronunciations were a bit trash
62. Second this. It's an even-handed book that provides a very succinct and accurate portrayal of those years.
63. Was the first book I thought of.
64. Yeah loved Pig City.
65. Same. So we want a millennials experience under Joe?
66. >...what the fuck “Boomer History” is "The good old days"
67. Oh basically that everyone figured out that he was nonce after seeing him not being able to explain the divisions of powers and a lot about protests. I am sure they were important but it's not the whole story and I don't think the majority of people in Australia care about the division of power...
68. Don’t you worry about that!
69. 12:27 has Wayne Swan on it. Blast from the past there. He doesn't look that different at all
70. I used this for a school report. Classic documentary work.
71. People had him figured a VERY long time before that, but he had a gerrymander in place along with a completely corrupt police force to keep protestors in line.
72. You mean dunce? Nonce means paedophile…
73. The Wikipedia article on Jo is pretty to the point. From what I remember though, since about 83 or so the state was totally over him, Labor actually had more votes but Jo had Gerrymandered the fuck out of the place such that he could not be removed. There were many street protests trying to get him to step down, usually resulting in people being whacked over the head by the cops and arrested. Just like now with Trump, much of the media protected him. It was only when he over-reached towards the end that started turning on him. If they had reported the truth he would have been turfed out 10 years earlier.
74. Interestingly I couldn’t find it in a library here. I ended up reading it at the Library of Congress in Washington. 😂
75. Protesters weren’t allowed to gather in groups of more than 5 people. I recall my parents going to vote at school and finding that their details had been purged from the register, along with lots of other people that afternoon. They’d voted many times before in that electorate. And the ‘we only need 33% of the vote’ to retain power was a big clue.
76. I haven’t gone to look this up and get the details correct but Mike Ahern basically arseholed Joh out while Joh was on a trip. Joh came back to find himself premier but not leader of a party I think. Met Mike ahern some of his rellies were schoolmates of mine. Good guy.
77. That makes more sense. Thanks! A lot of the response seems to basically middle class disdain which is kind of understandable but it doesn't explain much
78. Hawke was the real mastermind. Joh was doing his “Joh for PM” pitch, so Hawke called an election while he was overseas and not registered as a candidate. It screwed the LNP campaign at federal level too so Labor won a sweeping victory. This started a rolling set of events including the Fitzgerald inquiry that ended up in constitutional crisis with Mike Ahern the leader of the Nats but John refusing to resign as Premier. But yes, Mike Ahern was mostly a good guy who wrestled control of the party away from the corrupt Joh. Joh only avoided jail because it was ruled he was too old and frail to sit trial by the time all the evidence was collected. His first trial where he escaped trial it turned out the jury foreman was a Young Nats member. So much for Jury selection.
79. Thanks adding that. Was a crazy time.
80. I can’t help but think it will still be half arsed. Hardly anyone I know seems enthusiastic about hosting the Olympics, which isn’t a good start.
81. Battle of the NIMBYs now. My money is on the Gabba, I still can’t understand why anyone would build a third stadium so close to an existing two
82. Maybe we can use the mining royalties to pay for the stadiums!......oh wait....
83. It's a race we'll lose
84. It will be at vic park. One of Brisbane city councillors said as much at an event there last week. It makes a lot of sense, good transport connections, metro and train, walkable from city etc. Gabba is too hard to redevelop because of vulture and Stanley streets plus the school. Sell the Gabba for development (including large proposition of affordable housing) use the $ to offset Olympics costs. Would also mean far greater usage for cross river rail station as a daily commuter station. Sell Boondall for similar as Brisbane Live would replace it. The other option would be to get rid of one of the racing tracks and combine the space with Allan Border field for the stadium.
85. Stadium is in the too hard basket at the moment. As a river city, Brisbane is certainly short on bridge connections, with the [recent closure of the Walter Taylor bridge](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-13/walter-taylor-bridge-closure-traffic-what-you-need-to-know/104344324) really highlighting this issue. https://preview.redd.it/1zibwxn9dgxd1.png?width=913&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbc9019181874e234a66ea56218f3a049e647b93 Significant detour - source [ABC NEWS](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-13/walter-taylor-bridge-closure-traffic-what-you-need-to-know/104344324) What if instead of Stadium as Crown Jewel of Olympics, we build a toll-free multi-modal bridge as iconic as the Sydney Harbour Bridge? Can still have Olympic cauldron on top and run many events from / on the bridge, with the key Olympic infrastructure serving an ongoing use for the public everyday after the Olympics. Interesting events on the bridge could be archery, pole-vault and the diving perhaps?
86. My money is on a Toombul Stadium, at the old Toombul Shopping Centre site
87. Palazszczuk
88. Cancel them. I went to research before announced. 9 in 10 wanted them. After facts, cost, disruption 9 out of 10 didn't want them. And that didnt even include such for the para-games.
89. Imagine you can't afford to feed your kids yet buy a PS5 Pro to make your games look better. Even though you already have a regular PS5.
90. What if we held the Olympics in Townsville? 😂
91. Just like how hardly anyone on reddit knew anyone voting for LNP
92. It's 8 years away still....
93. Where are the lions playing in the meantime?
94. Did they really say that? Because when we were at the opening of the new Rochedale Metro bus depot, BCC were handing out brochures titled 'Victoria Park Barrambin Master Plan Summary', which said there will be a few minor Olympics events at Vic Park, but did not mention a major stadium. Realistically, there is no way they will ever put a major stadium right next to a hospital, which would create emergency services nightmares whenever there was an event. QSAC is also out for the same reason. I believe there is another site, that no one has yet talked about, but when it is finally revealed, everyone will immediately realise that it is THE best possible solution. But for whatever reason, the powers are keeping that site quiet for now. But the information is out there, if you know where to look....
95. Love ya work, but now the LNP is in charge, we can see a decline in PT and active infrastructure, and the bare minimum for the Olympics.
96. Geez. I’ll take that bet 😂
97. This is the dumbest take I've ever heard. More like you have a PS2 and software updates have phased out.
98. QSAC will be 50 years old by the time the games are on. It will need a complete rebuild of the stadium, and will need to stay as a athletics track afterwards, that wont ever need to huge capacity of an Olympic venue. Or build a good new stadium, provide generational infrastructure and decommission stuff that's going to need major $$$ even if the olympics doesnt happen.
99. Lots of people I speak to aren't against it, they just aren't super hyped about it. That's probably more due to the fact that it's so far away, to be honest. Hype will increase the closer we get to the date. It makes sense not to be super enthusiastic right now, 8 years away
100. You nailed it.
101. Gabba, they won't decommission it until the new venue is good to go.
102. You must always be tougher on crime, when its mostly poor people it affects. White collar crime is victimless and we really should give these entrepreneurs a 5th and 6th chance to get filthy rich so they can buy up multiple tables at our fund raisers. The tougher you are on minor crime the lower the crime rate, it worked 200+ years ago when the English started shipping out crims and its working like Australian Bank Stock in the U.S. where the prison system is full with minority inmates and giving great returns to those investors driving the tough on crime stance. They can't built prisons fast enough. See, the system works, the Liberals will float private prisons very soon. Just like Jesus said, turn the other cheek, into a prison cell and make sure the poor stay meek, we don't want that filthy vermin inheriting shit until we secure our financial futures in cushy corporate gigs. The above was brought to by sarcasm, some say the lowest form of homour, I say you're just too stupid to get it ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
103. this is all building up to the federal election. The LNP are going to introduce private prisons due to the "sudden" influx of criminals that will put a strain on our prisons, thus we will have "no other option" but to pay companies to hold them. they're turning us into america-lite
104. Don't expect them to take a scientific approach, they are a moral panic driven when it comes to these things. Feelings over facts. Personally, we should decriminalise and make all drugs here in Australia under proper conditions and product testing, etc. Otherwise, you just get people buying bad shit, and the money also goes to crime, and a lot of money goes out of the country to import it. People are gonna buy shit anyway, and best to keep tabs on those who are using them and use some of the money to fund rehab and social programs to help those who suffer from drug abuse. A hard on drug approach just often pushs the problem out of sight, more people killed from OD and crime, and makes criminal orgs a shit ton of money. People get and do them anyway.
105. Doctors, police and experts think the changes are a bad idea? Lucky the private school boys know what’s better for us /s
106. I honestly believe that they're more than happy for people to die from this because of their moral views that drug users = evil degenerates that deserve death. Fuck this election cycle and fuck the LNP
107. Classic conservative feelings over facts policy. Again.
108. In all seriousness, you should ask these questions on r/Townsville or other provincial threads. That's where the election was won and those or the results the Govt will work very hard to consolidate. The opinion of Labor voting Brisbane will take a back seat for the next 4 years. I agree with your assessment btw but who cares?
109. This is the beginning of a genocide on the poor and marginalized. I feel sick.
110. Just part of their classic daddy-state approach: if we just punish, exclude and marginalise enough of the right kind of people then that will magically solve all social and economic issues!
111. We will reduce crime by... handing out drug convictions in place of diversion programs. Genius
112. While losing the pill testing service is an unfortunate step back, to suggest kids will die at schoolies because of this is a little bit extreme. If the pill testing programme has shown us anything it was the vast majority of ecstasy had very little if any adulterants. This might be a welcome result of the dark markets self regulation or it might just be that we live in a golden age where market forces have driven producers to manufacture quality products The testing does not test for strength so it still requires people to educate themselves on how to take the drug safely. With or without government intervention the basic principals of harm reduction are no different than they have been for thirty years. Test your gear. EZTests are not as good as mass spectrometers but they are cheap and available through out the city. You can't untake a dose. If in doubt start with half. 100mg of MDMA is a moderate dose for most inexperienced users. Small females need a lot less but even a big burly bloke can enjoy themselves on a small dose. More than 250mg will deplete your serotonin stores enough to mean redosing more is harmful. A mistake a lot of people make is not understanding that MDMA isn't a drug to take over 12 hours. It's actually a shit festival drug for this reason as it really only good for 5 hours or so. If you are taking 3 or 4 pills over a night it is not the drug for you. Regulate your temperature, stay hydrated, look after your friends. Over heating is the biggest killer. If you see someone who is struggling get them outside around fresh air. The police may not be your friend but the ambulance service is. If in doubt call for medical assistance. No one will get into trouble so long as every one is safe.
113. Yes, the LNP wants kids to die. Why are we still surprised.
114. Where’s the TLDR?
115. Honestly, LNP will be counting on increased deaths to solve the ramping issue. The amount of resources drug users take up in hospital and ambo services is significant and they will just say no amount of education will deter someone from taking drugs otherwise anyone post pulp fiction and train spotting wouldn't be doing it. Then they just point to the cities that have tried the decriminalisation approach and they win the general population. It's stupid, but it's easy....the LNP way
