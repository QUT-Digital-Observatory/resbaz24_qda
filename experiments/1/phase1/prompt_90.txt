Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. There are two issues here. 1. Charging someone for carrying a minuscule amount does more damage than good. It could have been a one off and the amount is hardly anything to create a serious issue. As soon as you charge them, you create a criminal record. This can lead to issues such as getting a job, obtaining rentals, documents etc etc. Rather than prevent drug use, you encourage black market drug use. If you are on a strict one and out, you might be less inclined to seek help if you need it, or engage in preventative drug action. 2. Removing pill testing creates high likelihood of potential OD's and improper drug use. If you get given something under the guise of it not being harmful, take it, and it is in fact harmful, too late. If you get it tested and it's proven to be harmful, you've saved yourself. Without that outlet, the pressure stakes are higher than if you were to go, "I'll take it from you, get it tested and if it's dangerous, it'll get taken away and I won't get charged".
2. Actually, I agree with pill testing and medical intervention rather than locking them up, I was sarcastically projecting the LNP policy on youth crime and drug use. FYI, I have postgraduate qualifications and have never used the recreational drugs you mention. Alcohol, a different story *
3. You absolutely can tell people what they can and can't put in their bodies; you legislate such things and enforce it with appropriate punishment. The problem nowadays is this ideology of 'do what thou wilt' and believing people should be free to do anything they like without any regard to the wider community, combined with no consequences for those who choose to do the wrong thing.
4. Hey!!! He is just a young man that made bad decisions and we should NOT talk about it or judge him and his father based on those actions. Have some respect. Also fuck you, you dirty druggie, even if you just have a joint on you. Poor people aren’t allowed to do drugs
5. Jail. Let's call it what it is mate cmon... Boot camp makes it seem tame and they are justified in what they are doing...
6. Mate you ever cross during a yellow light??? ....Guess that means you aren't a law abiding citizen either yah filthy animal
7. So you've never jaywalked before? Because if you have, and I'd be willing to bet the farm you have, then you're not a law abiding citizen, are you? By pure definition someone jaywalking IS a criminal. See how silly that sounds? The law isn't black and white and there are very good reasons for that.
8. Making drugs illegal leads to crime. Who knew?
9. And who defined that as a crime? Maybe not Crisafulli himself, but it was some paternal 'tough on crime' shit-head like him.
10. Fuck off, cunt
11. Nitpicking grammar is classism, and we're in an informal setting here. This ain't no letter to the king*. *n fuk him 2 neway.
12. Spot on m8 Unfortunately to use simplicity ( there are exceptions as cities like Townsville being an ALP strongholds and the Gold Coast being pro LNP ) we’ve always had a huge divide between Brisbane and the rest of the state. Basically all the old school conservative type Libs got the arse when the coalition split under Petersen. There don’t seem to be guys like Terry White in the modern LNP. The religious nuts and National Party crooks took it over.
13. Since when is ending drug *use* the goal? In Australia, ~2000 deaths annually can be attributed to the use and misuse of every illegal and prescription drug combined. Alcohol causes three times that, and we celebrate it as an essential part of our culture. No-one is trying to end drug use. If the goal was to reduce drug deaths, drug-related harm, and the economic impacts of drug abuse, then there is a wealth of evidence that could inform policy - none of which Crisafulli and his pre-enlightenment bretheren are remotely interested in, because actually helping people is never the goal with these cunts.
14. Bro’s never heard of Switzerland
15. He justified it because Jen had it. Not because it affects 1 in 9 women. Because it affected 1 of 1 women he was married to.
16. The contractor who happens to be good mates with a minister in the govt?
17. Given we literally have a Texas here in Queensland, pretty accurate. Don't forget that One Nation literally tried to secure an illegal under the table political donation from the American NRA a few years back, only to realised they'd been stitched up by a sting from Al Jazeera who wanted to prove how cooked they're prepared to go.
18. Given our great reptile population, maybe a combination of both is in order. Australian Florexas? Texida?
19. Sounds like something Hawke would say after a few too many schooners.
20. A rising star that funneled $320k from the government during the Newman era.
21. They will build it for them then sell them for pennies on the dollars, it makes no freaking sense but it’s what will happen.
22. Slavery was always okay to conservatives.
23. That's the best part - it's not!
24. This is where Federal Labor needs to step in. We should of had that royal commission into the Murdoch media monopoly but alas they lost their gumption after Shorten's loss.
25. >which will make no material difference to them Hey, how dare you! They'll be able to get more respect from other millionaires, and that's what really matters. Fuck everyone else, let's make Australians pollies rich again!
26. Exactly. Not sure how much more illegal we can make illegal things though at the moment. Outside of public executions, we are at peak punishment. (Most of the conservatives will stupidly support this; right up until it impacts them or a lived one, then suddenly their black and white view of the world develops many shades of grey). People need to understand we need to live with all of these people eventually, so investing in rehabilitation, not just bigger and stronger jails is what’s needed.
27. Yep. Because I voted for Labor last election. What a mistake that was.
28. All good!! I also found it quite hard to read because of my eye twitching
29. Being south African does help
30. Hmmm, okay. That's interesting. Thank you.
31. Yeah, and if your grandma had wheels, she'd be a bicycle. Let's deal with reality, not fantasy. Psychoactive drugs have been used for thousands of years and will continue to be used for thousands more. No amount of 'just say no' has ever achieved anything. Pretending it does only leads to more sons, daughters, parents and friends dying.
32. Any drug policy works in the daydream version of Qld where nobody does drugs. In the real world though we’ve tried those policies and failed miserably.
33. Seems like the shoe fits you just fine cHaMp
34. Yep
35. Sorry the sarcasm didn't come across - agreed. (Though with the caveat that medical intervention is only needed when drug use is *in fact* a health issue - e.g. addiction, and that the vast majority of drug use is not a health issue but instead a personal recreational choice). Ofc, just because someone with higher educational attainment is *more* likely to have done recreational drugs, doesn't mean everyone with a postgrad will have done so. It's just the statistical outlay, and one that anti-drug campaigners often overlook or are unaware of. (further caveat - not suggesting that someone's worth is tied to their educational attainment, but I just like this stat because it subjugates the anti-brigade's view that drug users are unemployed criminal junkies, when the overall truth is the literal opposite)!
36. Id like you to shove your head up ass in that case. So why are they still allowing people to smoke when it's such a burden on the health system? why are we allowing people to drink alchohol when alcoholics are a danger to themselves and society? People are going to take what they want to take because believe it or not most people don't care what the government says you should and shouldn't do. If people want to take drugs why can't they have access to tests that can confirm purity and impurities To help them make wiser decisions. You can literally save lives with pill testing.
37. The mini Trump
38. I follow your logic but for clarification, traffic infringements aren’t crimes. Some actions are crimes though. Drink/drug driving, reckless driving(including excessive speeding), fleeing, failing to stop and render aid in a crash you’re involved in(but not minor fender benders, that one is just a fine for failure to exchange details). Oh and driving without a licence or while your licence is suspended/disqualified. Basically, if it’s a mandatory court appearance, they’re considered criminal acts and can result in time in custody. If all you receive is a fine with/without demerit points, they’re not criminal acts. They are just infringements.
39. And if I get caught I accept it and don't ask for orange light runners to be given leniency because I know what I'm doing isn't right or legal
40. I see Conservatism (right round the world) as Organised Crime now. They are all protecting each other right down to their pedo churchies. I'm really hoping Brisbane's sprawl includes more Greens and Labor supporters. I feel it may but the roar from rural is all nationalism and segregation. The roar from Liberals ...is religious ideology not stopping at controlling women's decisions for their own bodies but moving onto everything the bible hates. We can't forget how good ole Aussie Pauline was quite prepared to work with NRA to firstly get voted in and then to chance gun laws. I just had a friend murdered by gun....and these fuckers want everyone to have free access so we can live more like America. It's about the only good thing Howard ever did...and I do give him credit for that. I probably haven't lived in Qld as long as you as I lived offshore...so not sure about the Petersen era.
41. Foolproof way to stop people using drugs: kill 'em
42. Still don’t see how it’s a bad thing 🤷‍♂️
43. It makes perfect sense if your corrupt
44. Slavery is perfectly OK to religious conservatives. The bible has guidelines on how to treat slaves properly.
45. The Gillard government tried media reforms along these lines. Shouted down by all the media ganging up to get rid of any whiff of media regulations. Unfortunately only gives the media ammo on an easy "they're restricting free press" rhetoric.
46. Do U actually believe a 15 year old should get labelled as a criminal if they have a couple pills on them at a festival? Like genuinely?
47. Have you actually looked at countries with progressive drug policies? What do you make of the data?
48. You know a bit about suckin' on boots like a cock, aye champ?
49. There isn't a dirty boot for miles in any direction around you, is there?
50. This dude would own slaves today and see no issue whatsoever with it if it was legal
51. As a drug user I should add /s
52. He didn't give a shit until it affected a person he considered "his".
53. He's supposed to represent the people, and look outside his own family, and his own existence for what the **country** needs. If Jen made him realise, then that means he's never thought about the thousands of Australians and community organisations that have already told him what needs to be done. He didn't do it for Australia. He did it because Jen said he should.
54. Its indirect nepotism
55. Him funding it is not the bad thing, the reason he did it is bad. Theyre just a bunch of selfish fuckwits that only think about their own lives, so he had no interest in funding it until his life was affected by it.
56. He only gave a fuck about something when it began to affect him. He shouldn't need Jen to give him a basic sense of human empathy.
57. Absolutely. If they can kill, traumatise or permanently impair a person why should they be exempt from the consequences of their crimes? Their ages make it no less traumatic for their victims and families. 15 is old enough to know right from wrong.
58. Bold of you to assume they can read.
59. I mean, given half the chance, wouldn't you ?
60. We should really give Jen more credit than she got. I wonder how many other times she managed to get his head out his arse that we don't know about.
61. Bro he’s asking you about a teenager taking some MDMA, do you have any idea what taking these drugs actually does to you? Of course not, you’re talking like a fool. It doesn’t instantly turn you into a murderous psycho jfc
62. But like they are taking it for themselves. A personal amount. They aren't spiking people or selling it in masses. The only damage they will do is potentially to themselves, just like if they had one too many drinks and have to get their stomach pumped. Their ages make it so they are more impressionable and want to break the rules.
63. Ummm, no
64. Wow what the fuck is wrong with you?
65. Said the quiet part out loud there champ, nobody respects racists
66. Which race did I discriminate against? Just to be clear, I mean.
67. To be clear I don't engage with bad faith racists
68. The harsh reality is the outsourcing to consultants you’ve seen grow and grow as a trend for the last 20 years is a function of low white collar public servant salaries. The general public has this view that the lanyard class doesn’t really do anything and they twiddle their thumbs pretending to work while getting 100K What people want to ignore is that this is actually far too low. 120k is around the cap you can feasibly get to in most jobs unless you want to start taking on serious management jobs. And there’s no bonus.Do you know what private sector consultants get paid? It’s more than that, and the ceiling is infinite, and there’s bonuses. A lot of skill leaves the public service once they hit the AO7, AO8 mark because the progression crawls to a halt and there’s nothing more you can do. You simply must leave and go private sector to consult back to government at a wild cost to the agency - but hey, it’s not public servant salaries and it’s not new FTEs so who cares what we pay. People who talk about capacity building or weening off consultants want to pretend like there’s a free lunch where they can just ask nicely and the public sector gets more skilled and they can cut consultant use but without massively increasing public sector wage .
69. Out sourcing consultancy has become an addictive and costly habit of all state and federal departments.
70. It's not 100% a skill issue it's also a structural one. Cannot eliminate entirely but absolutely can cut it significantly... The LNP spent a lot on consultants last time they were in from memory so saying they will cut sounds like big talk.
71. So the LNP are planning on cutting consultancy costs "to reduce the growing reliance on costly consultancy reports", but then they're spending $50m on consultants themselves to figure out the best way to solve the youth crime epidemic that they fabricated.
72. The only consultations LNP need come from Jabba The Rinehart
73. My observation in the sector is that LNP *LOVES* consultants. Like REALLY REALLY REALLY loves them. They also created many of the consultants when they sacked thousands of public servants. Worth looking around how many big consulting firms donate or are members of LNP. Major. Would we rather cost effective and well trained staff who are held accountable, or very expensive consultants doing the same jobs? Can’t wait for LNP to start letting go of their consult mates. LOL.
74. chainsaw consultancy bill.. would make one hell of a mess
75. First the lnp will hire consultants to design the new agency. Then they'll contact people to work in the agency to get the "right skills". I don't think it's a bad idea, but it will take a long time to establish and lnp will still need to rely on consultancies in their first term, no matter what the costings say

77. I bet all those posting here against the LNP on a daily basis are outsourcing consultants
78. I don’t think it’s that sophisticated. Just a little echo chamber.
79. Nup mate.
80. The reason why so many people are passionate is because Labor is focused on vital investments in public housing, affordable transport, lower energy bills, free lunches for school kids, better access to regional hospitals, and more bulk billing doctors. These policies truly help people and contribute to reducing crime rates. In contrast, the LNP is proposing extreme measures like imprisoning children and placing them in re-education camps—approaches that have been tried & shown to be ineffective and deny real opportunities for recovery, while doing nothing to assist those in need. *It shouldn't even be a contender* We have the best-run state in the country, led by a premier who is willing to address problems strategically. This is the strongest leadership we’ve had, especially when compared to the LNP’s shortcomings. Furthermore, they’re threatening to criminalize abortion. While Chrisafulli has promised to resign if crime rates fall, he hasn’t made any similar commitment regarding abortion, knowing he can’t control that outcome.
81. If elected King of Queensland, I'll make all political donations illegal, all political advertising illegal, and any party affiliated persons not allowed within 200m of an active polling station.
82. Anyone who can look at this and not think the LNP are bought and paid for are just drones. When did it become socially acceptable (40% of us) to actively support such obvious pawns and not just pawns but pawns that are racist, hate women, hate the elderly, hate the sick, hate the poor and hate pretty much everyone that isnt the same color and religion as these clowns. Fuck em off kill the party. Let a more human party come through that actually shares our real values as a country.
83. Coal Australia is a lobby group headed by a guy called Nick Jorss. Nick runs a company called Bowen Basin Coking Coal (ASX:BCB) who owe the State a large amount of unpaid royalties. Queensland has a progressive coal royalty rates scheme where when coal prices rise to crazy amounts (due to Ukraine, etc) the State gets higher royalties. Coal companies still make a profit, just not ridiculous profits from war profiteering. These companies aren't improving efficiencies or anything else, just their normal job, so when coal prices are at record levels, it is only fair that the Stare benefits from this. Now that coal prices have dropped, BCB is one of the few companies that are still unprofitable under normal coal royalty rates. Why would they lobby over a million bucks to the LNP? Hmmmmm
84. >THE COURIER MAIL: LNP drops ‘fully costed’ promises…minus the costings. >The LNP’s would-be treasurer David Janetzki has finally fronted the campaign cameras for his big moment, but the release of the costings were terribly light on detail. >... >EDITORIAL: Arrogance on show. >It smacks of a party that is treating voters as mugs by simply assuming they are on track to win and so will avoid any risks along the way. [https://i.gyazo.com/8f3ebd131774f28f8ea350a4f25013b0.png](https://i.gyazo.com/8f3ebd131774f28f8ea350a4f25013b0.png) [https://i.gyazo.com/f474e9a692d4beaae3f7b15e9098ef16.png](https://i.gyazo.com/f474e9a692d4beaae3f7b15e9098ef16.png) Both Shadow Treasurer Janetzki and Deputy Opposition Leader Bleijie have refused to debate QLD Treasurer and Deputy Premier Cameron Dick. The LNP "costings" have revealed Crisafulli plans to cut $6.8 Billion from the Public Service. In 2012 when Campbell Newman committed to cut $4 Billion from the Public Service it resulted 14,000 Public Servants and frontline workers like nurses and teachers being sacked. It's now predicted at least 17,000 Public Servants and frontline workers will be sacked under Crisafulli's plan. I didn't expect Crisafulli to go full Campbell Newman 2.0 this election campaign. But here we are.
85. Sounds like the resource tax needs to be raised more if they have so much extra to go around.
86. It’s for LNP and watch all those royalties deigned to help out with our way of life disappear…
87. Their totals don’t match the ECQ data, I can’t be bothered drilling down, but I’d take this report with a grain of of salt.
88. Well this explains how they can afford to apparently be every bloody ad I get on YouTube. My watch history certainly wouldn’t suggest I’m interested anyway.
89. [https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/politics/queensland/other-queensland-union-vows-to-spend-labor-donations-on-fight-for-cfmeu-20240827-p5k5uq.html](https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/politics/queensland/other-queensland-union-vows-to-spend-labor-donations-on-fight-for-cfmeu-20240827-p5k5uq.html)
90. And the LNP wants to lift the ban on property developers - so they will get more. Let’s just not vote for the pricks!
91. I feel like I’m missing some pieces of the puzzle here, so help me out. Coal wants to keep making $$ > But making the $$$ is under threat because they are in a dying industry “non renewable resources” > Coal “donate” to political parties with the hope to keep them in business > for those political parties to stay in power they need the votes. To get more votes they need the voter needs something in return for their vote. So what is the voter getting in return for their vote? My Skynews brainwashed, right wing leaning parents swallow everything thats fed to them via Ruperts misinformation sewage pipe of an empire. They have been convinced that renewables such as wind generation is more impactful on the environment than coal is. While the start up for that may be the case (haven’t researched if it’s the case or not) the point being that over time its cost will decrease. Surely my folks voting these clowns into power will backfire on them somehow? What am I missing here?
92. Does the Labor amount include the advertising spend in support of them by trade unions?
93. Can someone put that 2nd slide into words for me? I really can't work out wtf I'm looking at
94. Would explain the fuck ton of LNP signage, even for candidates not in that area.
95. Why does this even happen in the first place? We just straight up allow our politicians to be bribed and no one calls it corruption.
96. It's because this election is entirely about coal royalties... Forget youth crime, Olympics BS or Crossriver rail etc. - they are just useful distractions in a textbook case of agenda setting by the media. The truth is that the 80% coal royalties, renewable energy commitments and phasing out of coal/gas have seriously pissed of multinational, tax-avoiding mining firms. So, it's only natural that they completely interfere with democracy and astroturf some absolutely laughable turd like Crisafulli... People are seeming to forget that only a few cycles ago that youth crime was the major campaign pledge by Campell Newman, who ran on adult time, adult time, child boot camps and all the other BS - policies, which caused an increase in recidivism amongst young offenders into adulthood and was lambasted by every major criminology faculty in Queensland’s universities. Like Dutton's nuclear, it simply cannot be considered as a legitmate or effective policy. I was considering moving back to Sydney a few months ago (from Brisbane) but put it off for a bit because I was starting to enjoy it more. But if this prick wins, I'm not sure how much longer I'll stick around to see his smug, corrupt, corporation-fancying face on the TV each day...
97. Wait but the article mentions 2.5 million spent by unions to support Labor and at least 1.5 million in union fees to Labor. That first graph is a bit misleading with this money not included
98. Libertarian party? I didn't see them on the ballot...
99. And you wonder why he hates green energy. Plain old corruption.
100. I've got no idea what their policies are, but I kind of want to chuck a fiver to the Animal Justice Party just so they have a number on the board of bribes.
101. Nothing with them waiting to lobby him for a reduction in royalties
102. "Australian Institute of Progress" Let me guess, nothing progressive about it and a centre-right grift "Institute"
103. This post must qualify as spam now.
104. Damn I’m pro industry thanks op for letting me know to vote blue the rest of my life
105. It pretty much proves that if you really want to change the world, don't become a politician, become a lobbyist.
106. It’s crazy how people think voting for LNP is a vote in their best interests
