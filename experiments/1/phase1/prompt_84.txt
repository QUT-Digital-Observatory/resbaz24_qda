Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. We get it - and I wouldn't put it past either major to run a scare campaign late on a federal issue for a state election! Labor is the natural party of government in QLD because it's actually quite a conservative Labor party, helped by the fact that the LNP atttacts those right of centre with reactionary ideas here. You'll hear the word restore a lot with the LNP, rather than create.
2. Why cast a donkey vote and risk voting for someone whose values you don't agree with? Just draw a line through the paper and be done with it. I used to feel the same way about compulsory voting until I saw how hard some groups in other countries fight to make it so incredibly difficult for people to vote that they just don't bother. Compulsory voting means that the government also has to make voting accessible. I'd rather that than the alternative.
3. Na they are saying the opposite. Just all the people who arent dumb fucks know it's coming regardless of what they say
4. 2 plates bench should be requirement to even be considered for any leadership role. 1 plate for the ladies.
5. And my father! And mother. And brother.
6. Do you have any actual evidence, not opinion, that backs up your claims?
7. Your contention is simultaneously that we can’t afford to rehire but can afford triple rates to external consultants? Absolutely the quality of thinking I’ve come to expect from your sector.
8. I’m also one of those contractors doing work for the state because there is no FTE for me - and I regularly do overtime. It’s a raw deal for me and everyone else. The labour hire company treats me like dirt, it’s so demeaning. I’m always holding on hope for a proper contract but with budget cuts now the LNP are back I feel more hopeless than ever.
9. They definitely were hired back. The ability for the government to operate hasn’t changed. Let’s be honest please.
10. I'm not saying the Newman cuts or the proposed LNP cuts are net good, but cuts do have their place from time to time. Generally, their best use is to force managers to make inefficient processes more efficient, thereby removing the need for so many bodies. If cuts are too swift / too strong, then it can have the inverse effect - lots of things fail at once, the smart people leave, and management needs to pay contractors who are disincentivised to optimise.
11. I am not trying to defend or demean either party here, just according to your initial logic Labor to should be excluded from the ballot also. Both parties do this because they get beaten over the head by the media and the other side if they do. Likewise, opposition's are loath to do it earlier because until caretaker mode anything they submit to treasury can be requested under freedom of information requests (essentially allowing the government to access there intended election policies before the election). This means that increasingly opposition parties from both sides don't submit their policies for costing until only around 30days before the election, meaning they really can't get them out much before the last week anyway. The system is cooked and doesn't support decent policy formation by either side when they are in opposition.
12. Here’s the thing, I didn’t say he was incompetent, I said he gives off barely competent vibes, there is a huge difference. The truth is, the first time I heard of him, he was on the news ripping up an invoice from the NSW government (politicking) since the few times I’ve seen it heard of him, he just comes across poorly but the media is good at that.
13. But they are politicians, that makes them inherently evil. That doesn’t mean they are on the same level of evil.
14. Your logical fallacy is anecdote. The data clearly contradicts your anecdote and several of these crimes you talk about you'd have no idea if they were youths or not. The biggest source of crime currently are 30-39 year olds, not youths.
15. > 10 LNP DnD They out here playing dungeons and dragons now?
16. Bit fucking late to be asking that, mate. Have a Google. What good has LNP ever done for the average person? All they do is get in, destroy the budget and give their rich friends whatever the fuck they ask for. Unless you earn a *lot* of money, you're about to vote against the best interests of almost everyone in the state.
17. Are you capable of asking a question that isn’t loaded?
18. Are you this painful irl?
19. Labor helps the people, rebates on your power bill, funding to public services etc. Liberals benefit the rich, the only people who benefit from them is those who have the money to own several homes, are considering buying more, probably have some successful business running too etc.
20. I hope you’re a multi millionaire already my friend because if not, you’ve voting against your own future.
21. Several things and enough to deserve being put back in. This is not a hard decision. If you’re struggling g with it I have grave concerns for you.
22. 3 years of consistent surplus without completely gutting the public sector this time around and Miles has introduced some pretty damn decisive reforms that have genuinely made people's lives just a tad better when they're struggling so hard right now.
23. Uh well since your party decided to hate queer people I don't really have to pay attention to what Labor does beyond not hating queer people as well. Since you know, I like being free to live my life with my fellow Australians. So I guess to answer your question. They are less bigoted is why I vote for them. Out of self interest sure but I'm sure as fuck not going to vote for a party that would actively go out of their way to make my rights and QoL worst.
24. Make Crisafulli look like a complete arse. No my apologies, he did that himself when he couldn’t show a set and stand up for women’s rights.
25. The one we are aware of, where he helped extort money for a training organisation? That the job you’re blowing off about?
26. I'm not sure trading while insolvent is quite the point you think it is
27. How is that a measure of quality for a politician? How does it make you a better plumber if you have experience as a fence builder?
28. Dude was a shit stain working as a journalist for a shit stain network before politics and was insolvent trading after he got voted out previously. It's really not the flex you think it is.
29. No he fucking hasn't. He's failed at everything he's tried to do. He fucked up several businesses he first handedly ran into the ground head first and got himself done for insolvent trading then went ahead and syphoned government funds WHILST under investigation and paying hush money for it... The slimy cunt belongs in the same jails he's planning to put ur kids in...
30. Doesn't make it bad, just cause we are paying for it out of taxes, that we are already paying for. Means that it's still more money in citizens hands
31. Typical LNP reply. Dole bludgers are a very very small minority. Same as the youth crime bullshit that has been spun around this time... Totally feeding into the bullshit again. Is every bit of dribble that leaves ur mouth the same old party rhetoric? And never been on the dole in my life 🤷 so u ain't paid shit of mine bud. I was military for 10 years and now I'm teaching... I pay and have paid my fair share of tax... But whatever helps u sleep at night 🙏 U don't wanna pay massive amount of tax then reduce ur income. Then u won't pay so much tax and u can be just like everyone else and u will have nothing to complain about right? Fuck off out of here that's 1000% another avenue of LNP thinking. U got urs so fuck everyone else right?
32. You’re in a bubble my friend. Go spend an hour looking at the comments of the Facebook posts of the Labor accounts
33. And me, and my father, mother, maternal grandfather and grandmother and my paternal grandmother...? Shall we continue?
34. They most definitely have not recovered across many departments, I know because I'm currently contracting a dozen staff to fill the void a decade later as it never recovered. The industry I never made it into because I couldn't leave Brisbane is still being proped up by private developers and consultants charging several times the rate a government employee would have cost. The vacuum the Newman changes caused absolutely stuffed so many industries well and proper in Queensland and it's still costing the government as a result, regardless of who is in power. The talent that was in various departments has gone, the private sector has become more enticing for staff because they are making more off the government and can pay higher wages. The government can't just throw more money on wages because it's tied to specific rates that private sector just put bid, and charge straight back to the government department. Youve got sectors like nursing and teaching that were stripped out in different ways due to lack of resources or not growing capacity or forcing people to work in overcrowded under funded facilities, meaning people left those industries due to poor conditions or burnout as there wasn't enough staff. This still hasn't recovered to this day. Having seen first hand how a number of departments do operate, the ability to be effective and efficient is far harder due to contracting the work out. If there is dead weight that can be handled case by case, role by role just like any other workforce. Removing the position and/or the man power by chopping people or roles left right and centre doesn't solve anything at all. You do realise the majority of public servants that get cut by the LNP are never the middle or upper management right, it's the workers on the coal face, dealing with the shit first hand. Any upper middle management that does get cut, usually gets replaced by some LNP ministers mate or cousin or whatever who either continues to do the same shit job the last person did or a whole lot less.
35. They absolutely weren’t and some who did were hired back under labour hire. It’s appalling. The department I’m working in is stretched.
36. Cuts don't force managers to make processes more efficient. They force managers to either outsource or overload their staff, neither of which is efficient.
37. Anything said before the word but is a lie.
38. Finally half a voice of reason and look at Reddit response
39. Oh, I 100% believe every party should have to have policies and costings released. You are correct and thanks for explaining. Yes they would get beaten over the head the media and by voters, which would be great. Forcing parties to reveal plans… yes please, great. It sucks things are the way they are. In my mind, everyone should be able to get a clear description and costings of each party policy well before voting. I even think it could be standardised, no fluff, it should be like a phone/internet contract or the nutrition labels on food.
40. The main difference is Labor confirmed during the election campaign X, Y, Z policies were funded by coal royalties, and A, B, C policies are funded by borrowings and increasing debt etc. They released the page by page details on Thursday, but we already had clarity on their spending weeks ago.
41. I don't like to judge things on vibes personally as I prefer concrete evidence and information
42. I should add, not every politician is bad at their job, many are decent, I grew up around politicians, many of my jobs have had me around them this is why I firmly believe they are all evil, even ones that I personally get along with and respect, at the end of the day, the vast majority are going to put their interests above the communities and those who don’t, rarely see a second term.
43. People who would step up and represent you, be the voice of their people, where you would otherwise have none, put up with public scrutiny, and cop being called "inherently evil" by ignorant twats like you, you think those people are inherently evil? You wouldn't have one eighth of the courage required to do that job, just sit on the sidelines and complain about them all. And the fucked part, is you think you're doing the right thing. I'm a full time working man, never committed a crime, always paid my taxes, supported my wife on single income so she could get her degree. Hell, I've only ever had three traffic tickets: defect vehicle, follow too closely and no seat belt. I fully intend to enter politics in the future. To represent a community I care about, to be part of improving our society for us all, and to right injustices. All of a sudden, that makes me inherently evil? Pull your head in mate.
44. Evidence for this claim please? And are you talking qld wide or where this person lives?
45. According to them Labor is comparable to Tiamat, I wouldn't be surprised
46. Don't forget last time when they removed all restrictions on pesticide use and increased land clearing beyond even Brazil in their best effort to kill the reef.
47. Worth noting out that this is EVERY LNP government.. not just singular terms or staffings and both state and federal 🤦 100% agree :(
48. Disagree but all good. Moot point now they’ve been ousted.
49. Someone’s got their knickers in a knot. Military hey, so I paid your salary for 10 years. Again, you’re very welcome.
50. Let’s not, I might start crying.
51. Everything runs fine. Amazing what happens when dead wood is cut off. Not much.
52. Job still getting done. The public service don’t work like the private sector so it’s really not a valid point. Too much dead wood and it needs further culling.
53. Doing nothing means nothing changes - what do you suggest a senior manager should do if they perceive that processes are unoptimised and wasteful?
54. I didn’t judge, I asked a question and simply stated the vibes I got.
55. Yes, they are inherently evil, They aren’t there to represent the community, they are there because of the lure of power. You might start out with good intentions then it’s all about keeping your seat, you become a slave to it, the community’s concerns take a back seat to your parties wishes, not the community’s, heck my community is calling for the government to act and call out Genocide in Gaza, my local member is silent on the issue, why, his community overwhelmingly condemn the actions there but politically, doing so will damage him. I personally know current and former politicians and know what politics does to people, yeah I’d do it, my career has been all about helping people but politicians only help themselves. Good luck with your ambitions, I wish you well and hope you prove me wrong but I highly doubt it, I’m yet to meet a politician that hasn’t given in and let the power corrupt.
56. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-13/criminologists-debunk-youth-crime-crisis-claims/104445432 It's not just state wide, but nation wide they're at an all time low. https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/20/townsville-youth-needs-community-led-fix-rather-than-new-detention-centre-expert-says It's even noted here that even in frequently cited Townsville (which has the worst crime in the state) youth crime was decreasing back in 2022 when this whole debate started to pick up steam.
57. Yeah moot now. But yeah if they did rebates constantly they would have to increase taxes, but seeing as this rebate is a one off or atleast only a when needed not every year, then it doesn't give reason to increase tax rates to make up for the extra money being spent on the rebates. So the same amount of money is leaving our pockets to taxes but some of that money is coming back to us as a rebate.
58. Sure, let's just stop paying the military so u can keep a bit of extra money... are u for fucking real 😂🤣
59. 😆
60. Too late 😢
61. Does it? Please do tell me the departments you've had first or even second hand experience in running fine that aren't only doing so by paying 3 times the price to private firms to backfill the void. The dead wood still remains you numpty. LNP have literally announced they'll make their own independent (see mates) panel of dead wood to review it all. Talk about pissing on your leg and telling you it's raining 🤦 you'd believe anything they spun for you wouldn't you...
62. Allow for individual staff to innovate and act independently to come up with solutions rather than taking away funding and telling them lmao get good.
63. When Campbell Newman made cuts they didn’t sort through people on a case by case basis. He got someone to pick a bunch of numbers on a spreadsheet then axe them. It’s really screwed up how departments were run because vital people were axed overnight.
64. One set of stats show the number of offenders. How does that work when regional areas are majority repeat offenders? It doesn't mean there is less crime. Also, breach of bail has only just been made a crime from 4 October so let's see the crime rate go back up again. I live in a regional area. The ALP local member and their complete disdain for their constituents on youth crime is exactly what got them voted out. In regional areas crime is still a big issue. Even if the rate has fallen because the numbers are reported in a way that benefits someone, people don't like being told youth crime is not an issue when they live in a town with 5 cars being stolen a night, having their pride and joy torched. We don't appreciate hearing crime is down. It's still a problem.
65. Sounds good to me. Maybe you’re not as dumb as you sound.
66. Every facet of my life is fine. I don’t have any issues dealing with any government department. In fact, the last few years I’m kinda impressed with how good dealing with many parts of it has been. I have issues with private companies like Foxtel and Qantas. Abysmal service.
67. How precisely do you propose to allow staff to innovate? The only way is to stop other work to allow time for it, but if all of the work is important then that means you need to backfill the bodies with expensive contractors. The only other way is if staff already have spare capacity, which would lead to: why didn't they innovate their way out of it already?
68. I have a better idea. Seeing as u pay so much tax maybe u should just fund the country urself as u seem to think u are the sole proprietor for what every1 gets from the government already. We normal people like to call that 'head-up-ass-itis' and ur one of the worst afflicted cases iv seen...
69. You may not, but there are fundamental issues in the Qld government departments still directly attributed to the fact they were decimated by Newman all those years ago. They still haven't recovered. And where they have, it's a direct result of them having to pay 3 times the labour costs for contractors or consultants because the government simply doesn't have them and the market in Qld for a lot of industries is now so geared differently since Newman.
70. Maybe ur not understanding the gravitation of the problem then. Those government entities that you are happy and impressed with are going to end up like foxtel and Qantas if cuts keep being made and departments privatized. The same ones u say provide abysmal service...
71. No, you don't have to stop work to allow for it. Innovation and evaluation is a continuous process you do as you carry out your daily activities and is a constant thing. If you decentralise the process and leadership so that individual team members are given freedom to come up with ideas on the fly, disruption is minimal and performance and results are optimal. This is what is commonly known as Continual Improvement Processes and is a cycle all effectively managed companies should engage in. If you're outsourcing CIP and having to have dedicated teams for coming up with shit you're doing it wrong. It should be something each and every person involved in a process do constantly in real time.
72. Name some of them. What does the market is geared differently mean? Why would it need to return to how it was if it’s different now?
73. 100% that is the optimum solution. In the real world you need some spare capacity in the team to be able to effect the innovation approach. It's also a huge cultural change for government. I'm starting with the presumption that the cultural change won't happen without an impetus, and that there might be no spare capacity. I'm struggling to understand how an organisation that historically has not encouraged a culture of innovation would suddenly start innovating. As a senior leader you need to do *something* to facilitate it.
74. I've already covered this with you. All of those who were sacked either contracted back via a private company, or left the industry or left Queensland. Many professional industries involved in those cuts haven't gone back because now the private firms can earn 3 times the amount so can pay double the wages the government can offer. The government can't just pay out their arse in wages because there a set tiers of wages they can pay people. No one is taking those government jobs in a number of sectors because the private sector can just keep paying more and charging more, it's a never ending cycle. This is exactly what the LNP wanted to achieve, they know they still need the same people to do the work but if their business mates can scoop up a whole bunch off the top then it's a bonus for them and a bunch get plowed back into the LNP through donations and votes and marketing campaigns. This forces the government to waste more money to achieve the same thing and the LNP just turns around and says it's all Labor's fault because they are bad at managing debt, when in fact we are always in debt due to LNP throwing money at nothing and then building no infrastructure or social policy and instead giving tax cuts to the rich and claiming to be tough on crime etc when in reality they just change the metrics for it to appear that way. LNPs whole policy platform relies entirely on smoke and mirrors to fuck over the average Aussie and reward big business and rich bastards while convincing idiots that it's all for their own good 🤦
75. "In the real world, you need some spare capacity in the team to be able to effect the innovation approach..." No, it's really minuscule because it's such a passive process. "It's also a huge cultural change for government." It's not. It is something that is already in place because these concepts aren't new trains of thought. They're part of standard business management practices widely accepted now and have been for 40 years. You are making an assumption that teams in the public sector aren't allowed to innovate or come up with ideas and submit them, and this isn't the case. Even the military, for all its strict rigid discipline and hierarchal chain of command, encourages individuals to innovate and come up with more effective practices all the time.
76. Lot of word salad there. Name one industry that backs up your comment.
77. I don't understand, therefore, why the processes are not optimised. It's been an accepted business practice for 40 years. In the 30 years preceding Newman, optimisation didn't happen sufficiently (such is the perception). You're telling me it is encouraged. Why isn't it happening? Or are we saying that continuous improvement has been happening effectively, and there was actually no room for cuts at all when Newman did it?
78. IT is the industry I work in. It's full of contractors across multiple departments. It was all in house a decade ago. Same goes for planning, engineering, environmental sciences. That's the area I've studied in and at the time prevented me getting a job because it affected the whole industry across the state and the only option I had if I wanted to pursue that would have been to move interstate but life didn't allow it at the time. There's also a whole bunch of contractors associated with three of the biggest departments being Education, Health and Main Roads. Especially for consultants these days.
79. What makes you think the processes don't get optimised? Anybody can perceive anything if you lie to the masses enough about a non existent problem.
80. Ok so you can’t name anything other than the one you are in. And that’s going fine. So what are you actually arguing here?
81. A perception that processes are unoptimised is a stated assumption in the thread. The core question is: what should a senior manager do when they perceive that processes are unoptimised. See: https://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/s/2dD7kVu3M7 Your answer was [paraphrasing] that a manager should make room for individuals to suggest innovations, and you're strongly implying that there is a continuous improvement culture embedded in the state government. Now my question is: are you saying that the perception is incorrect due to lying to the masses (I.e. state government processes are optimised), else why has the continuous improvement culture not yielded optimised processes?
