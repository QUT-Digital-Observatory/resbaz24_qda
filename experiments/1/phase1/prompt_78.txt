Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Don't be silly lol. The LNP actually helping people other than themselves and their mates.... does everyone not understand how they operate lol
2. Coz Poppa Rupert says so in every paper and station he owns or influences.
3. After the LNP canned the NBN and then living in an area where the NBN was implemented vs the area im in now with shit internet I put the LNP last every year. Labour not that good either Im not a fan of the excessive immigration without thought for who will build it all, i could buy an actual house but not these days, stuck getting crushed by strata pirates. Allowing the buying of piles of property left right and centre by internal and external money has hurt this country hugely and will hurt for decades to come.
4. Politicians really only care about their own wages and their job, so they all spin lies to try hook the public in so you vote them in so they have a job for a few years ,they really dont give 2 hoots for you or me or queensland or australia ,just the vote for them
5. It seems to me that people are having last minute hesitation about Crisafulli and the LNP. Many issues are lacking detail and require more detailed information. Regarding the abortion issue it seems to me that very late term, live birth abortion is no less than infanticide. But I don't know the full details. Is it just unviable babies are aborted. If not, full term live birth abortion is murder. In the last few days they have said no more pill testing. I wish young people would not touch this rubbish but since they do I don't want to see them die just for being dumb. Similarly the LNP announced they will cancel the 3 strike drug laws. I don't believe it is a matter of letting offenders off because I understood it was dependent on them undergoing counselling. Be very careful David Crisafulli. You and the LNP are poised to win tomorrow but you are flirting with throwing it away.
6. He'll help out one section of the community (conservatives) by hurting other sections of the community (women and the underprivileged). They love that shit
7. Supressing women's rights and killing our kids by letting them go to jail. How tf did we get here?
8. He isnt helping the community hes destroying it. He wants too get rid of aborsions which is horrible. What if i child gets raped? What if anyone gets rapes? Theyre suck with s child they dont want.
9. Count the number of pro-ALP and pro-LNP posts in this sub, that should give you an idea of the bias. And then compare it to the polls and bookies. Massive echo chamber!
10. I’m hoping he saves the 30 odd million labour wasted on the QLD racing integrity commission
11. To begin I would just say that I voted green in a safe inner city Labor seat, so what I say next is just an opinion What the LNP brings is they are not Labor. To be honest after nearly a decade in power I don't doubt there is quite a lot of bloat in the public service that a new government will feel they can trim It's inevitable that jobs for mates and duplicates exist. It would bee foolish for the LNP to replicate the hatchet job Newman attempted but it's equally foolish to believe that the current work force doesn't need a good refinement with a new set of eyes There is also the union stench that following the CFMEU debacle it will be a change of direction particularly with so much olympic construction going on On the topic of the olympics we will finally get some sort of decision regarding the main stadium, something Labor seriously dropped the ball on earlier i the year
12. Honesty you're probably not too far from the truth. It seems that both big party leaders here in Queensland seem to be just as bad as each other. I have resorted to voting for independents as my first preference in recent years, as I feel the big parties no longer stand for the values they once did. Although in saying that, in very simple terms LNP and ALP have some difference. I'll probably cop some hate for this, but I couldn't care less. ALP for the most part tend to spend a lot of money on welfare, public transport, education... which in the short term makes people happy. The problem with spending lots of money, is that it will eventually come back to bite the taxpayers in the long run. In that if you spend lots of money (sometimes money you don't have), you will have to pay it back eventually. But as a benefit they do make life a little easier for people, leaning on the side of a bigger government body, more progressive social/moral stances and tend to have a bit more of a globalist perspective on the world in recent times. LNP on the other hand tend to be more conservative in the ways they do things, both economically and at times morally/socially. They are normally economically conservative, so they put limits on public spending, to reduce government debt. This normally comes in the form of privatisation, tax reforms and focus on big business and high income earners as a way to increase jobs and investors. The LNP also believes in smaller government, which is why you'll see them closing down parts of government or public sectors that they don't see as beneficial or rather more beneficial as private sector industries. Their policies usually reflect a push against long term reliance on government, so you'll see policies about self reliance rather than government dependance. Morally/socially they tend to align more for religious Christians or general conservatives, this their push for abortion policies. Protection for faith based schools... So in essence, ALP benefit in the short term, but do damage to the economy in the long run unfortunately. LNP will be seen to be making life harder in the short term, but arguably more beneficial in the long run. Obviously there are differences on both sides, something like negative gearing from ALP I would argue is a conservative economic reform. Strangely the LNP is not in support of it seems. I think this is definitely seen more on a federal level then a state level. State level can be hard to gauge or see how this occurs sometimes. But as people have been aware of lately, things are coming out especially things about abortion, youth crime, housing...
13. A lot of people, mainly older have no real idea what these guys are doing. They get all their news from channel 7 and the courier mail.
14. He is going to make abortion a criminal offense so if you're a young woman I'd be saying a big NO, personally. Who thinks they have the right to make this decision for anyone else? Mind blowing.
15. Tbh no politician left or right gives a shit about you. They're all there to help their mates as they're the ones who donate a shitload and influence the policies. The best way to vote is to vote for the lesser evil. I reluctantly put the ALP first even though I cannot stand the major parties and the LNP + cooker parties last.
16. Truth is most of the posts in reddit are just political staffers trying to sway your vote either way. Do you seriously think you'll get answers here? And ffs why are you torturing yourself posing these questions. Have a look at the key issues and make a choice. Honestly, no one cares about you individually. All politicians have to balance out what's best for the community and their backers. Labor does it, LNP does it, Greens do it. Accept that. Get on with doing the good you can do in the community you're in.
17. Seriously if you vote either major party you’re voting against your own interests put them last
18. Vote for the Devil you know at the moment or vote for the Devil we used to know when D.C. was the Campbell Newman puppet master. The lack of choice for voters in politics is criminal, there should be a Royal Commission. The choice to waste money on the Olympics is going to make Queensland less livable..... how can anyone think that spending money on new sporting facilities is going to help Queenslanders keep the roof over their heads and food on the table. D.C. even wants to increase spending on sport facilities and cut money from essential services (he just isn't being honest about it and refers all his decisions to independent consultants doing a review after the election). He even wants to setup his future consulting business with government money. You know where he will be after he leaves politics, board of directors club with is new consulting firm
19. He won't bankrupt the state.
20. The answer is no.
21. Building new prisons to fulfill his promises is kind of like a community stimulus project. They are phenomenally expensive to build, operate and staff.
22. Just his mates. Note.. he doesn’t believe in climate change or reproductive rights.
23. The government should be in the background, we the people should make decisions. There a bunch of circle jerkers, circle jerkers comes to mind.
24. Crisafulli? What name origin is that? Certainly not italuan 100%.
25. Steven Miles has the charism and is doing things. If LNP wins i call shenanigans
26. >KEVIN BONHAM: This has been accompanied by some remarkable changes in leadership ratings. In the final Newspoll, Steven Miles has recorded a Better Premier lead. >… >That was his first Better Premier lead ever, and the first for a Labor Premier since April 2023, snapping a run of 17 losses from various pollsters. Crisafulli has gone from a personal rating of net +12 at the start of this campaign to net -3, his first negative rating of the term that I can find after at least 19 positives. >This sort of recovery by a state government that has started losing heavily in polling is very uncommon. The more people saw of the two Leaders, the more people’s opinions have changed. Crisafulli and LNP felt entitled to run a small target campaign, with no policy details, no costings details, scripted lines for the media, and his opinions to be treated as gospel. He wants to be revered as the Saviour who led the LNP to a landslide victory, where election night will be his coronation. QLD voters might write a different story on Saturday night.
27. Fucking this! That is exactly why I don't understand how they're predicted to win. I want to know the reasoning behind someone that votes for that shit stain of a party and I'm not talking about wealthy voters but the average Joe like generally curious
28. I'm actually blown away as to why so many people think it will be a landslide for the LNP. The bookies were like 20/1 odds at one stage for Labor to win, down to about 9/1 over the past few days I think. LNP are an absolutely terrible choice given some of their choices over the past few weeks. I'm aghast at how it's potentially so close. I can only imagine the pearl clutchers are thinking about "all that nasty youth crime" and wanting a change to "keep everyone honest" but Jesus, I'm mystified.
29. What makes you a swing voter? I dont understand people that say that they are swing voters?
30. And they're running the propaganda machine at 150% talking about how the greens want to legalise ice and heroin? You'd have to be mindblowingly fucking stupid to believe that shit.
31. Just another perspective - swing voting is interesting to me because when you're part of a marginalised group, you cannot vote based on policy alone. You have to vote in "survival mode" first. That is, will this government destabilise or stagnate on rights that affect my community's ability to just exist. Even just the rhetoric hitting headlines does real world harm to marginalised communities. When LNP went at abortion, suddenly they went after 50% of the population (not exactly, but you get the point). Suddenly, many people realise that conservative values that undermine social progress are actually deeply offensive to modern life and result in real world harm. As a member of the LGBT community, it's terrifying to think people entertain politicians who would do genuine life-altering harm to us, we're just too small to be as close to home to many people. That's obviously not what you're thinking when you vote, but undermining social progress is always at the root of conservative parties - whether they come out loudly swinging at women's healthcare, or quietly vote down a bill that keeps LGBT kids safe at school.
32. Labour has decreased youth crime and initated strategies to reduce recidivism through programs and early intervention Labour has developed more social housing than any other recent government Labour has increased healthcare services with introduction of minor trauma centers and more frontline staff Labour initiated grocery and petroleum station investigations into price gouging Labour supports super profits mining tax and has slated that to pay for many other community initiatives such as free lunch for school kids I’m labour all the way , lnp would never follow through on any of this
33. That’s the Katter/Nationals/God influence. Not to mention their financial backers in the mining industry. They have no interest in society, only wealth. Old mate is as bad as Newman. Corruption out in the open, repealing green policies so that his mining financial backers profit. Under LNP we move backward while the rest of the world moves forward, you only have to look at the NBN. He’s talking about CGT as a fix for the housing market like it’s Labor’s fault, they introduced it. They’re going to fix everything but are yet to say how and people are swallowing it. 4 year of going backwards unless you financially back the LNP or can help them get to power.
34. I'm the same! They're def last on the card this year. And I had a phone call last night, recorded message from that clown and now a text this morning. Why are you obsessed with me David? How are they allowed to spam us, but others have unsubscribe or stop in their messages?
35. Shame they used up all the candidates less than favourable pasts leading into the election, as these kinds of things can result in by-elections and a minority government in jeopardy of being not able to pass any laws. They will want to go the whole term and avoid an early election so there backers have enough time to cash in on there investment.
36. Community? Selfish scumbags have been convincing everyone how great it is to be a selfish scumbag. They won't prevail, but it's a never ending battle.
37. Suppress women how?
38. How does he want to suppress women? Genuinely curious.
39. Why the fuck have we mote introduced proper laws to mandate truthfulness in political advertising?! As you said, they've made obviously incorrect assertions about crime rates that can be googled in 5 seconds but nothing is done to stop them running these ads?!
40. Every time I hear "they've been in too long" I just can't help but think, 'what? so you want an unstable government?' like why?
41. It's almost as if meaningful, sustainable change takes time.
42. Perfect answer. LNP are shit and offer nothing but will take everything
43. They don’t mine coal at mt isa but I take your point. I have spent over 8 years living in but fuck no where qld and it really didn’t matter who you vote for, nothing good comes out that way even though most of the qld budget dollars come from out there. It’s all just scare campaigns as they have nothing positive to offer. I also think in qld that the LNP are much more national biased than other states or federal and that’s where we are getting the Americanism stuff from. Now living in the city I can see and feel benefits from the Labour Party policies and I’ll be damned if I’m going to give my vote to someone who will do nothing for us just like the regional areas get.
44. We do this on a cycle and it’s mystifying. We have a long running ALP government, which at times grows complacent. We vote in the LNP who promise to “fix the rot”. They fuck things up. Then we remember that they’re shit and vote in the ALP for another prolonged stint. Can we just skip it this time and keep Labor?
45. I mean, ESPECIALLY in QLD. We -know- what happens every time a LNP government gets in, and half the current bunch of dickheads have publicly spoken about their links to JBP. Why is anybody shocked when they fuck the state up?
46. I've always been told both parties are shit but what's getting to me is that people themselves are voting for someone that actively screws them over in the long run and that's what I'm trying to understand. What is it that makes the average person that doesn't own a business or multiple investments vote for said piece of shit. I think I'll be going down that route soon and just vote for any independent at the time that has anything remotely close to what I like and the big 4 last and just ignore the rest until next election
47. Libs ain’t done shit since before Howard. They are so bad for the economy and everything else in australia that voting for them is voting against yourself
48. That's the other thing that fucking pisses me off is that a bunch of old males get to choose what a woman can and can't do as if they know what it's like.
49. The reproductive rights issue is certainly very concerning
50. Remember, it's a uter-us not a uter-you.
51. A very honest answer. Outside of SEQ things are different.
52. From my shitty memory lnp don't help with that kind of issue they just make it worse, aren't they the ones that like to slash anything to do with healthcare, the words he's spewing now are worthless because it's election time, what have lnp done that is better then what Labor has done? I'm actually asking here not trying to be an ass or do you mean they are that desperate they don't care about the past and just think shoet term as in the current government haven't done anything for them atm?
53. that is just standard LNP playbook isnt it? agree re labour, i'm not bound to any party, but LNP is very clearly the worst of the lot unless you own a coal mine.
54. You forgot dodging question and just repating that's not in the plan lol
55. >Surely he'd have done something ok by accident even? This gave me a good chuckle.
56. Best, most balanced response in this thread. 90% of voters who always vote one way do because of identity. And changing their mind is not an option for the majority.
57. Hey, and maybe, if we put "food" on these "youth criminals" tables they won't feel the need to commit "crimes" Or we could just keep beating them down........ that's proven to work /s
58. Or first home buyers being locked out of the market by greedy politicians buying up investment properties, especially those of a particular stripe.
59. Agreed, their "policies" are mostly just dog whistles for their conservative base, but lack any real substance.
60. I'm sorry but I feel you're wrong on both counts, I've actually gotten a few really good replies if you wanna read through (they're the paragraph ones) as for their website there's no fucking way I'm reading that shit, the fact you even said yourself they're light on the detail on their own plan says it all, I imagine it's more bs like the flyers they're dropping everywhere plus they won't give me the downside to what they're doing like others that are more informed on the subject then me and I feel it'll be designed like that for a reason considering they didn't want to spill the beans on anything until the last bloody second
61. It feels like this whole youth crime crisis stuff came completely out of nowhere I literally never heard of it (outside of some older people insisting that cities are unsafe in Australia now) until about a month ago
62. Good 'Ole "Fuck you I got mine" boomer mindset. Seriously, there is a generation that couldn't die off quick enough.
63. I'll take things that didn't happen for $400, please Ken.
64. Yeah half the reason there's so many consultants in the public service is because of the huge cuts during the Newman govt. There's only a few ways to reduce the number of consultants: provide fewer government services, hire more public servants, part public servants more so that they stay in the public service. I know I definitely don't want fewer services and I highly doubt an LNP government will hire more full time employees or even pay the ones that are there more so I'm very sceptical of their claims.
65. Also people below made some great points about Crissafullasht. Sorry The graph on funding is a great visual aid. Lnp generally wants to take funding out of social programs that experts in related fields support, usually because they take a burden off the medical system and keep people alive. Lnp are also against climate change action, green energy and sustainable future. Also against immigration, which is always funny(sad) for a colonised country. Picture this - deliberately making the oceans rise, destroying the Pacific Islands, having a huge influx of climate refugees who are referred to by lnp as Australia's fruit pickers in a derogatory sense, because elitist and racist, and then having no programs to prevent suicide. But the rich n well off will have no problems, because they'll have so much money, which inherently solves problems right? Monopolies definitely don't create problems. Lnp also usually tried to gut the education system as well, make curriculum that don't create well balanced young people, but desperate ignorant workaholics living in cycles of perpetual fear of losing what little they have, so much so that they don't have the time or ability to learn about what is being done to them. And subsequently will raise generations of people who will accept crumbs, of crumbs, of crumbs. I'm saying revolt yeah, but learning about lnp policy from the abc or the guardian or like, anyone but the lnp will be the quickest way to understanding what they're about. And to prove it to yourself, read abc, then lnp. Compare the 2 🔶️ Sorry again big rant 👁👄👁
66. Make your way to the courier mail FB page then 🤷
67. Or, and hear me out here…. One of these “sports teams” is objectively a good and forward thinking governmental candidate that is batting for the home team, and the other is a dodgy corrupt self serving con job of a government that is openly and objectively planning in drive QLD back 20 years and has a leader and team with a track recorded of documented corruption and hasn’t told a single truth or been open with their plan, hiding behind nudge nudge wink wink bullshit. Maybe, just maybe, it’s not an echo chamber, but your sports team is wrong.
68. Unless LNP win...then I want a recount or another election immediately
69. everyone is stupid except me
70. I have only had calls and SMS from the LNP, shows they are in desperation mode if they need to do this.
71. Genuine question - do you know how much the royalties bring in? And do you know how much Labor has already spent in promises? Just to get clued in, the money has already been spent 3 times over and we are well into heavy borrowing territory now with more and more "free" promises being made. S&P have pointedly said that if this sort of thing continues and we don't reign it in, we're going to lose our AA+ rating which would be terrible for our economy. I don't want to sound like an old boomer, but Labor are definitely not "fiscally responsible" - they are gambling here. I don't think LNP are better either, but let's stop shrugging our shoulders and saying that mining royalties are a limitless money tree.
72. Premier for 10 months only actually. Not 18 months!
73. Labor wins in spite of Qld being a 1 newspaper state. Labor wins and the Murdoch papers and media is rigged. You think you've said something but you haven't. Your post up until that point was quite good and I agree.
74. You mustn't have read the news lately to think there isn't any media bias
75. I don't think this is true. You will hear some pro-LNP and anti-Labor opinions, but they will be so relentlessly downvoted that you should expect to scroll a long way to go find them.
76. Can you name any positives about the LNP then?
77. You're absolutely right, but that won't stop the Reddit hivemind downvoting you. The complete unwillingness to genuinely have a debate - and this disingenuous thread is not welcoming a genuine debate - is exactly why this sub is such an echo chamber. It's simply not worth trying. I'm not even an LNP voter, but it's incredibly frustrating seeing people lamenting how much the non-ALP parties lie, and in the same breath spreading misinformation themselves. Smashing downvote on anything that isn't pro-ALP based on the headline and blaming Newman for everything that's ever gone wrong (despite 27 of the past 33 years being Labor governance) is the r/brisbane playbook. Come Saturday night, it'll be a meltdown in here.
78. Yes, it pisses off the media moguls when they can't fully control an election outcome. You honestly think the media has a pro Labor bias?
