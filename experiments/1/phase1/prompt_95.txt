Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. The 13 health is terrible for the most part, they aren’t actually independently triaging, they are asking the exact same questions on the website. They do have these wait times in the US, of course in cities that just means you may choose one hospital over another. Realistically, no ED is ever big enough or well staffed enough for the current population as it was built for a as population based decades ago.
2. > The LNP will also cut new satellite hospitals that are desperately needed to offload the minor injuries and illnesses. 100,000 people utilised these hospitals in a year so that's 100,000 less ED presentations. Where does this information come from? [The LNP](https://online.lnp.org.au/news/three-phase-plan-to-heal-labors-health-crisis) have advised as recently as 7 October that (highlighting just the reference to Satellite Hospitals) > Cure ($448.18 million of additional funding, not including the existing hospital build funding or additional clinicians) > * More CT and MRI machines: an extra 9 CT and 6 MRI machines, to free-up hospital beds and bolster ‘satellite hospital’ and regional hospital services. > “Queensland’s ‘satellite hospitals’ will be bolstered with additional CT and MRI services for referred patients available 7 days a week, taking critical pressure off our struggling emergency departments. They will also be appropriately renamed in consultation with medical experts.”
3. Another Labor staffer posting to save their job. Sick of this sht. I'm voting LNP because of your post now.
4. Nah the witchdoctors need to get off their high horses and accept transparent accountability.
5. Any concerns around the risk of self-triage can be managed with community public health education programs. They are already been used for a number of other initiatives, such as the satellite hospitals and how to choose whether to go to your GP, satellite hospital/urgent care, or hospital emergency. People aren't idiots, they can be educated around the information available to them. The argument you raise actually undermines the use of satellite urgent care centres because they too are dependent on some self-triaging to determine whether to go there or hospital emergency. I just don't get what the difference is. Give people the benefit of the doubt to be able to adapt and make decisions in their best interest. I think most people understand how triaging works at its most basic level - its not first come first served so wait times will be a guide only.
6. Right? What wait time are they reporting - the longest? The average? If so, which average? One of those ideas that sounds good until you consider literally everything about it. If it's about transparency then weekly or monthly reporting is just fine. If it's about the illusion of "choice" then I'd remind the LNP that going to the emergency department isn't a choice, and if too many patients are turning up of a weekend maybe they should be asking their friends in the highly privatised GP sector why that is.
7. I'd prefer if they added an additional level of triage to reduce wait times. -'go away this is not an injury that needs to be seen at a hospital- make a doctors appointment, put a bandaid on it or get your mum to kiss it better' The wait time is automatically indefinite and you never get seen
8. The only potential good that it could serve, is making people come up and complain if they have been their longer than the time posted. And the reason that would be good is, if you wlare well enough to complain, you can probably be pushed down the list to make way for people sicker.
9. And damn it works well in my experience! I walked into ED a couple of months ago. I knew I was unwell, hence going in the first place, but thought hey I’m probably not *that* unwell, I’m in for a couple of hour wait here, but it’s better than dying at home. Triage nurse looked almost visibly shocked at my state, and pulled me straight in to be seen and I ended up being admitted very quickly. Honestly had I had the ability to check wait times, I may have thought about wallowing in bed a bit longer like I had for the previous 3 days.
10. First die first serve would abstract it aptly.
11. I have done consulting for government when I did consulting. I only took on gigs where multiple agencies and groups had already tried to resolve a problem/come up with a solution and didn't - I was a terrible consultant because I did not stretch out engagements I just got in and took exactly as long as it took and was done. Technology in government and a lot of consultancy for government is beyond awful, wilfully awful. It does not attract the best people, there are ample amounts of waste and empire building. No shortage of 'everyone else is stupid and I'm a rockstar' mentality. I saw every stereotype that people hate about IT people being proudly displayed. I spoke to my local member about this last week who was doing the campaigning thing. Spoke about my experience with government as a subject matter expert on some things in technology and how you get treated with the same expertise as an individual. Highlighted technology things and advisory to government and explained exactly how it was beyond stupid. Helped I was able to pull out previous examples of gov advisory panel advised $30m to do something, I advised them that they were completely incorrect and it was less than $1m - relates to asset management I could go into it but this is enough detail. This stuff has been consistent across governments too it is a structural issue made worse by the fact that technology recruiting is a dumpster fire akin to 'what if real estate agents did not require a license'. Earlier this week there was the thing I learnt through this subreddit about the emergency vehicle priority system for ambulances and fire trucks that was implemented 9+ years ago rarely working while the department of transport are building an AI team and focusing on LLMs (which is idiotic on many levels). Right now the only glimmer of hope I have today is that my local member gets back in and follows up on his promise to continue a conversation I was having about the systemic issue in a week's time. It's the fact that this is all so achievable and the problems are so avoidable that pisses me off. I know what internal gov spending on IT services looks like and I described the cost of getting just a database spun up and hosted as actually criminal and highway robbery (you could buy a rack, the hardware, server space and a full time DB Admin and still have half the money left over for how much they were charging on a monthly basis... New Server every month!!) Woo. This was a long rant. But yes. They are shit and it's also not 100% the fault of the elected so change in government without interjection will not change it. There is still the Olympics coming can you imagine the amount of technology grifting that will happen unless serious changes happen.
12. If Govt IT project in healthcare …it will be at least 3-5 or possibly ever
13. Currently hospital managers have access to these numbers so they would only be creating a website with the de-identified data displaying in real-time.
14. Also i checked the website and the promise is "within 100 days" which is hilarious tbh
15. I wish we had more 24/7 GP clinics. I’ve tried the home doctor service twice and been disappointed but an actual 24/7 clinic with equipment would be great to take the load off ED.
16. >Q Health and the Government of the day The federal government skates by largely without blame despite the fact that all large Australian states have huge problems with ramping and the feds could fix it within a week by providing more funding Instead the aged care sector continues to be a shit show putting even more pressure on state hospitals (Not an actual week but you get my point)
17. And yet hospitals run like a business (ie private ones) have much lower wait times.
18. Only the ones that "donate" to them
19. They absolutely consult medical professionals about this sort of thing, but only after their hearing aids have run out of batteries
20. They shop around until they find experts who agree with them
21. Maybe this is about patients not doctors.
22. I agree 100%. Programs like CAREPACT and falls team have been great. I just saw another commenter here say they want to put MRI and CT in satellite hospitals and that's just grossly unsafe because of how underdeveloped they are currently.
23. They have this in NSW as well, it helped me in some non-urgent situations find the least busy hospital.
24. Yes, this is an incredible service and I'm glad the public has access to it now
25. My daughter might have whooping cough but by god I am not waiting a few hours to have seen!
26. She would have been safer in a hospital if something went wrong with her breathing. Waiting shouldn't take priority over a child's wellbeing.
27. Cant ask that here. The echo chamber gets angry. Labor wants to pretend it is not the party in charge
28. The continued updates they're installing? Extra bulk billed 24/7 clinics, more regional hospitals, more nurses and doctors - these all take time to build and train staff to fill - not something you can do overnight. Ramping times are trending down even with massively higher numbers.
29. Private is usually more than just the ED fee, there's gaps in any diagnostics as well. If I expect to be admitted I'll definitely go private, but I'll never forget the time my mother got sick of waiting at the PA whilst I was having an asthma attack and was struggling to breathe and took me to a private hospital and the gaps were phenomenal.
30. there's a been huge population shift since the last LNP gov and the satellite hospitals are perfect for things like a simple bone break, as i said above its saved 100,000 ED presentations
31. There was probably different things happening behind the scenes that made those wait times drastically different and any kid falling off a scooter is high priority as it's a high impact injury.
32. They critically assess your symptoms based off the questions and how they are answered. I have experience in the field and its a lot more involved than people would think. The nurses will choose your point of care ultimately and the questions are just a tool to help reach a safe outcome. Sometimes the answers they have aren't what you expect and it can be frustrating, but it's also ultimately up to the individual what they do.
33. I used 13health recently and found it a great service. First instance they directed me to an urgent care clinic, second time was after hours and they were able to organise a telehealth consult with an ED doctor. Definitely a service I would recommend and use again.
34. You're downvoted but you're partially right. 13HEALTH isn't *quite* what you're saying, but it's highly risk-averse due to the nature of telehealth. They generate their fair share of inappropriate ambulance callouts.
35. Emergency CT and MRI are useless if there's no operating theatre or ICU in the satellite hospital. Just going to result in more ambos transporting from the satellies to actual hospitals. Also I just checked their health page and nothing was mentioned about keeping the 7 new satellite hospitals labor has proposed.
36. Looking at your comment history of you shitting your pants about the alp 24/7 reeks of desperation beyond anything I could post.
37. People’s perceptions change with information. In the case, more information has a detrimental effect. It’s all well and good to speculate but there are academic studies on this and it’s demonstrably worse on patient health to advertise wait times.
38. Not to mention it’s important people go to the hospital in their catchment more often than not - public hospitals are funded based on the number of people they are expected to help!
39. Hmm... well sometimes when it's like a 4+hr wait for a cat 5 that can be seen at their GP, satellite or non-urgent clinics, I'm pretty sure they're given the ;) heads up ;) about alternative options if they aren't too fussed on waiting. DISCLAIMER: maybe it happens, maybe it doesn't...but maybe it does.
40. Funnily enough you don't get "pushed down the list" though. Annoying as it is on triage with people coming to complain about times, sometimes (sometimes!) It helps us pick up someone who's deteriorated in the waiting room. But hey, if you think the wait times suck, chuck a pen to paper and complain to your local member 😉
41. !subscribe
42. 3-5 years, $1 billion over budget and won't work whoever is in government.
43. I'm sure that is what they would do, instead of something more logical like ensuring the information is going into a data warehouse centrally to use that information without having to ask for it. Then display from there. Not saying to do it, but there is no data strategy or consistency in government and a lot of people working in the data side of individual departments apparently know this... I really should get access to the real time streaming opendata but the other data sets are just flat out published reports and not datasets, using them directly for anything outside of a limited range is like averaging averages.
44. Name a government agency that isn't above changing the milestone dates and saying everything is still on time and there's nothing to see here.
45. Private hospitals divert complex or serious cases to the public system - like literally shift them via ambulance to a different ED. Easy to keep the wait times down when you can just chuck something in the "too hard" basket and have it not count.
46. Because fewer ppl can afford them. Easy to have a lower wait time when your customer base is limited
47. Some of the MIICs can't even staff their ultrasound service. The general public seem to have an obsession with MRI/CT ignoring the cost of the former and radiation of the latter. A good example of *what they need, not what they necessarily want.*
48. Don’t go to ED for non-urgent issues and we wouldn’t be in this situation
49. You’ve heard of people dying in hospital waiting right? No need to lecture me thanks. Also, I’ve been to hospital with my children and waited 8+ hours only to be told to load them up with Panadol and Nuerofen which by the way can induce asthma attacks. Hospitals aren’t the best all and end all. You’re lucky if you get an intuitive nurse and doctor that will listen and not just write you off.
50. There are some, I guess it depends on the kind of hospital cover you happen to have how much it stings. Thankfully mine covered everything but the initial ED fee, and the wait was kind of worth it on that specific day. It’s definitely not what should be the expected default option though!
51. It was pre satellite hospitals. I’m sure I’m not the only one,nine who will be considering everything since 2015 going into the ballot box, not just the last few weeks..
52. lol I’m bad at communicating. My point is we should NOT be knowing the waitlist. They assess us and take us in according to injury, as it should be
53. That was my exact point. Mine wasn’t a major issue so of course I waited. My sons was and they grabbed him right away
54. Also the Children's hospital seems to be run quite differently.
55. I used to be an RN, I’m quite aware of nursing assessment and triage. Thanks though.
56. I’m a former RN, was not impressed. Just my 2 cents though. You know we’re allowed to have personal opinions. I’ve found the urgent care in my town to be fantastic (prob better than the ED in some instances).
57. The time I called, as a former RN, there was ZERO critical thinking on the part of the RN. I was complaining of a specific issue, but their question algorithm kept pointing them towards something completely unrelated to my complaint. An ED triage nurse would be able up discern the difference because they’d be using their brain, not a questionnaire. Hope this helps!
58. To clarify, in your post you've said > The LNP will also cut new satellite hospitals Where did you get that information? It's not that I don't believe you, it's that all of the publicly available information I can find from the actual LNP doesn't say that at all.
59. Can you please provide a source which states the LNP is closing Satellite Hospitals.
60. Na just sick of them post crap in reddit. They'll lose. The world will keep turning. In a few years they'll be back in. The world will keep turning. Throughout it all, social media will be a land of fake posts that is used by political parties to influence people who can't think for themselves.
61. Exactly for example, if someone has symptoms of arm tingling and back pain, sees there's a 3hr waittime, then thinks 'well it's probably a pinched a nerve and i'll waste time' - when it could be a stroke or heart attack. All the education in the world wouldn't change how the brain rationalises not waiting around.
62. So how is this initiative different from people deciding whether to go to urgent care, a GP or hospital?
63. I’ve worked triage and we definitely given them alternative options but some are determined to be in the public waiting room and bitch at us about it anyway
64. > chuck a pen to paper and complain to your local member bold to assume people complaining about wait times are literate
65. Ahh I see you've tried the Q Health payroll system
66. You're right, healthcare needs nuance and data could be used a lot more effectively then just a number displayed on the screen for the public
67. They’d resource accordingly.
68. I agree, but there are times when that is the only choice.
69. Oh true haha my bad!
70. I don't think you mentioned you were a former RN
71. The current state government built seven satellite hospitals since 2023. They've proposed to build another seven satellite hospitals in Rockhampton, Fraser Coast, Yarrabilba, Cairns, Mackay, Sunshine Coast, and Beenleigh. OP means the LNP have refused to commit to the new satellite hospital projects. Since it's not LNP policy, they don't have info on it.
72. No they cant because they are counting the not building as removal. Which is labor play book of promising the world and complaining lnp wont agree as they know it not possible to fund. If labor where going to build 7 new hospitals why havent they in the last 30 year.
73. They're not removing them, they're refusing to build 7 more like Labor has promised
74. I think it's regular people like me who are worried about the LNP policies and cuts announced (yestderday!). My post above is a direct response to a public announcement from the LNP with references as to why I am concerned. Take your bias and emotion out of it and really look at what they want to do compared to Labor. They want to punish people for drugs the first time and reduce crime? They are creating laws that lock up more people and increase statistics, defeating the whole campaign. This is why reddit (a generally younger demographic) is pulling their hair out with frustration seeing these proposals.
75. Because it adds information *that is not relevant to the healthcare decision*, but may still influence that decision. If you're sick enough to consider going to the ED, then you should go to the ED. They will then assess you to see if you're critically unwell in which case you'll be seen straight away, otherwise you'll wait. If you look at this list and see "oh, it's a 3 hour wait at XXXX, I'll either stay home or go to this other hospital where it's only 2 hours even though it's half an hour extra away" you're putting yourself at risk. Not to mention that wait times are *meaningless*. If you go to the ED with a papercut, you *will* wait for many hours until every other patient has been seen. If you go with a severed artery, you'll be seen in 2 seconds. Which is reported, the average, the longest, the shortest? It's meaningless information since the queue isn't FIFO. The only thing that would be helpful is if staff at the EDs were given a bit of information about wait times, and could triage patients to ensure they are not critical and *then* send them to another hospital where they might get faster treatment.
76. A GP isn’t open at all hours. It’s just another variable people need to factor into their decisions. And as stated in OP’s post, with a link that you are free to read, this variable acts as a disincentive for people to go to urgent care.
77. The triage telehealth number is for that, my scenario would be for someone rural with only 1 hospital and no after-hours services to choose from, which is most of QLD. Its a persuading factor in getting timely care.
78. That person with a 3 day history of a sore toe who gets a cat 5, spends 16 hours in the waiting room overnight and then complains to the ombudsman about the wait times. Love that person. 🙄
79. Fair and sadly true.
80. I didn’t, so I’m saying that now because people are acting as though I don’t know what I’m talking about. Not only am I a former RN, but I’m also chronically ill so have a pretty decent understanding of the healthcare system as a whole. Public and private. It’s very bizarre when people defend it because while yes we’re lucky to just be able to access it, there is a lot wrong with pre hospital and emergency care in Australia as a whole. I’ve also worked here, in multiple states and overseas. But again.. I broke a cardinal Australian Reddit rule of “don’t ever be negative about something ppl like no matter what your life experience is, other redditors are the only correct ones” 🥴
81. But to the contrary as shown above they have committed to bolstering satellite hospitals. That isn't scrapping. That is the direct opposite of defunding.
82. Labor built seven satellite hospitals since 2023 and have proposed another seven. It can be built. It can be funded. The LNP have chosen not to commit to the projects.
83. Can you please link the source that says they're refusing to build them.
84. Look I get your concern. And we all want a better society. But, honestly, worrying about this stuff isn't healthy. Deadset get out there and do good. Politicians do their best. They get it right most of the time. Worry doesn't solve it, just hurts you. Didn't mean to be a prick to you. You seem like a decent person and I'm sorry.
85. I'm well attuned to how the political system works. Am connected with both major parties through my work. Miles is a good guy and so is Crusifulli. The media beat up on both of them is hyped up. Happens every election cycle. Then... The world keeps turning. Whoever wins, things will always get better.
86. I did the telehealth thing yesterday and the doctor said “I can’t give answers over telehealth” im like so why was this suggested to me? Its garbage service in my opinion…the gp’s refuse to run tests or do referrals, the satellite hospital told me to go to hospital because they couldn’t treat the issue i was having and the hospital treated me like a bloody burden wasting their time despite the bleeding hole in my breast that was badly infected at that point .. i think Australias health system is a joke and only getting worse ..no ones taken seriously..people can’t afford or get into gp’s mine was booked out that day and reception told me to go to satellite and the satellite just told me they couldn’t do anything because they are a glorified building and to go to the hospital..my health is getting worse and no place is listening or taking it seriously and i have given up with it ..the hospital refuses to run tests and tell me to go to gp who also refuses to do tests and tells me to go to hospital ..i hate the runaround Im letting it take me next time im done fighting for competent healthcare its not worth the hassle anymore
87. Yeah I wouldn't have framed it as cutting new satellite hospitals. The LNP are continuing funding to the existing seven satellite hospitals, but are not committing to building the new seven satellite hospital projects proposed by Labor.
88. How many of the LNP proposals have Labor committed to fund?
89. Well they haven't announced its part of the plan? So they won't be building them
90. I can understand why we all feel frustrated for different reasons and i agree i actually need to worry less lmao, so thank you for apologising and actually helping my worry there
91. They adopted all of Labor's Budget in June, promising to honour Labor’s Budget over the next four years. Since then they've add on a range of Labor policies during the election.
92. So you lied. Thanks, that's all I needed to know.
93. So that answered none of the question. How much of what to the LNP are promising are Labor committed to? You're saying it's wrong that LNP aren't committed to Labors promises about satellite hospitals but this is a two way street. Why should LNP be singled out for not committing to another party's promises if Labor aren't either?
94. No, I have reading comprehension skills.
