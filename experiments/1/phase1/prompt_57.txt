Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Yeah it is important which is why the ALP has been doing a great job while the morons in the LNP couldn’t run a federal budget surplus for over a decade.
2. If I recall correctly, it isn’t the Libs delivering record year-on-year surpluses. But whatever makes yourself feel better.
3. You're in a surplus under Labor you Titanic Gronk.
4. Have you checked the books recently? Or can't you count that high to see how good they've been?
5. Fuckwit.
6. Can’t believe they actually tried to say that. They even said tonight that miners will “return to Queensland”. It almost like they dig where the resources are hey 🤔
7. But that long history was a long time ago. This is only the second time in nearly 40 years that LNP have won
8. [removed]
9. There has already been talk of an abortion reform hitting the floor first thing but ok. Be dumb I guess.
10. I agree, but the two party system is very much alive, especially when the media promoted this by only featuring ALP and LNP.
11. Yea so funny to see labour voters crying about cost of living/housing when its literally been all their government importing millions of people faster than tradies can pop up extremely rushed housing complexes, 1 million Indians in the last year and a bit, and Indians now buying 32% of property compared to Australians at 22%, these numbers are already shocking and do not bode well for the future of the country escaping becoming Mumbai
12. The Fuck you on about. Must be at least 60 to be a boomer. And pretty sure qld has been Labor since 1989 (except about 5 years) so those old folks must have been voting Labor then. Brisbane is almost entirely Labor seats to. It's more about where you live than your age.
13. You need the one that looks back to the last time he was a Minister, where they did essentially the same thing with other promises. The costings indicate debt or slash, and LNP campaign in other people's debt so they opt for slash usually.
14. We will soon know whether that was the right choice or not…
15. You are literally here trumpeting the opposite...
16. Sydney only had 7 years from announcement to the opening ceremony and did it well. We can do it.
17. "You wouldn't know her. She goes to another Russia." For the very slim chance that you're not being obtuse: [https://www.ilga-europe.org/report/rainbow-europe-2023/](https://www.ilga-europe.org/report/rainbow-europe-2023/)
18. How?
19. Your child's life is not at risk, everything will be okay, I can assure you.
20. ![gif](giphy|krhW9yWEI0x0Y)
21. So efficient. Oh, don't forget the Nursing Prac students now expected to assist in actual treatment of patients without official qualifications, no pay and absolutely no proper training. Partner was a Prac in Newman years, she was used as just another nurse and given access to things she shouldn't have been allowed to even remotely be near without supervision. I guess we have a "short (one) term" memory problem
22. I agree that it's bad policy. But it's not as consequential as throwing away billions of dollars a year
23. Exactly. Bullock said this in no uncertain terms.
24. Maybe less fucked, but still fucked nonetheless.
25. Because every government is attempting to fix this issue. Labor had plans in place to try slowly fix it. LNP now have the choice to double down and speed it up or destroy the progress Ultimately no matter what happens tho it should go down a fair bit even if LNP slow its progress ALOT
26. Ahh yes. Government Spending is special money and doesn't contribute to inflation.
27. Free lunch provides every child with food. Children without food are from poor families so the policy would directly affect the bottom % of people. Depending on how they did it, it could also eliminate bullying of the poor% (like if they just literally give every kid the same lunch, bullying is gone) This is a starting point, but it would help that kid stop lashing out/foghting/being outcast and then going into the gangs and whatnot. It’s environmental you’re right, and making children feel safe and not hungry helps with that. No one just steals a car, it starts from somewhere and I would argue that it could have started from them stealing food.

29. Not to mention as shown in data breaches in Vic and NSW often their data systems are more susceptible to attacks because a quick way to save money is not spend it on the additional security layers.
30. LNP shills and making shit up. Name a more iconic duo.
31. 😱
32. You didn’t. You weren’t doing the same things on the internet in 1999.
33. They didn’t get a bailout…
34. >We get what we deserve. The Smrt State.
35. Most disappointed since Abbot won. It's like waking with a feeling of dread and impending doom about the future.
36. Ok doomer.
37. Fares and routes are set by TransLink who then fund operators
38. Ohh well my Sunshine Coast $0.50 fares will be fine then /s
39. Is be better convinced of your expertise in public transport planning if you could spell “route” correctly. The reason fares on the GC or other places with private operators are not 10x higher is that TransLink set the fares across SE QLD. We suffer by having very limited services anywhere that the private companies cannot make money. That forces more people into private cars and means more traffic - contributing to the gridlock we are experiencing.
40. > Privately contracted bus roots doesn't result in 10x fares like Jesus Christ as someone who follows public transport really shits me off when people make this dumb claim. Then you've clearly never had to take a bus or coach to somewhere rural, and have only had experience with private bus routes within cities.
41. F
42. They voted in LNP. Guess their time was positive.
43. Sure, but people are getting themselves worked up and blaming them for removing 50c fares already, when all evidence points to them just keeping it. If they had the intention to remove them, they would have been less specific with their commitment prior to the election so it didn't damage them as much when they performed the U turn. Of course, they MIGHT suddenly change course and piss off the electorate, but I'm not sure why everyone is piling on about a thing that may or may not even happen. Just an emotional evening for some, I think.
44. Yeah you're right, having to pay 3 bucks instead of 50 cents is definitely on par with people being killed by weapons of mass destruction.
45. The books are looking good across the country on the back of the high inflation and interest rates, higher costs = more tax going into the coffers. If the government gave a crap about inflation they would remove fuel excise to lower transport costs and force industries to pass the savings on. Higher interest rates only help the government and banks profits and have proven to do very little to affect inflation.
46. Bro is fuckin silent on this one. No replies to anyone.
47. Narcissist
48. Strange how that works. At the time it was almost like they expected us to think they’d start mining QLD coal right through the face of earth from China or similar in some diabolical scheme to avoid the resource tax.\ Yet they stay, they mined and they still mare millions, paid they shareholders, paid their executives annnnnd still paid the higher tax to compensate the people.
49. Ww2 expert here and wasn't even there. I didn't know intergenerational trauma worked that way.
50. By whom exactly? Happy to be dumb. See you in a year and we can check in.
51. That’s federal labour, dumbass. State labour doesn’t control immigration.
52. Mate I’m Indian, am a citizen and have been here for 20 years. 1 million Indians? You are fcked in the head…where are your numbers from? Why not just admit when you see us it makes you mad? Hard to believe we are in 2024 some days
53. The housing shortage is a decades (and longer) problem - and a federal level issue. Look back at Shortens' housing plan and tell me it couldn't have made a massive difference today if implemented then. What is needed is probably some combination of addressing stressors on the private supply- like regulating AirBNB, increasing public supply through public housing, and policies which look at zoning, tax structures, and a whole host of other things. What we'll get under LNP is probably a reduction to public housing, letting the private sector go untouched, and increased buyers grants which just prop up demand further.
54. Never said they were Boomers. Also median age is higher in regional areas. But I agree with you, young adults living in regional areas are more likely to vote conservative as well.
55. But according to Reddit there are no costings and no plan or are we still looking backward?
56. he's joking, read the rest of his posts
57. Sounds like cope mate. My comment was just in jest. There's no way this baby's going down after it's already gone up 100k in less than a year and there's rate cuts on the horizon 😂
58. It does, only when there is too much of it. Which there isn't right now.
59. Again we feed every child lunch that wants it. Have done for a few years. Hasn’t stopped the kids engaging in youth crime. Hasn’t even stopped them being verbally abusive to the people giving them food. I mean, most of them just truant and go downtown and steal the food they want instead of the food provided. Because the pull of home is far too strong. The culture of home is far too strong.
60. Bless your little bleeding heart, I am sure you mean well. Provide free/subsidised meals for those who need it. If you do it for everyone, it will just mean those savings bid up prices elsewhere in the economy.
61. No, I actually did. My cable internet in circa 1999-2000 was around 40 mbit. I've never hit 40 on my shitty ADSL plan that I'm currently on. As for my internet selection, i wasn't doing much steaming back then, because it didn't really exist, but I was doing more gaming (because I was a huge nerd)
62. Read it again :)
63. Agreed & the bus most people ride on (Brisbane City Council area) are owned & operated by the council. The person I replied to suggested the LNPs mates would be purchasing buses on the cheap…makes no sense.
64. I believe so as the LNP said they’d keep them.
65. Almost a certainty that now they are in with a majority, all of their "promises" will be ripped apart early so they have 3+ years for people to forget, like what happened with Newman.
66. It cost me $13 a day to get into the city before 50c fares. That’s $65 a week. $130 a fortnight. Which equates to just under 15% of my income after paying rent. To PUBLIC transport.
67. The German government temporarily removed a 30c tax on fuel in May 2022. Surprise surprise wouldn't you know it the fuel companies found excuses to put prices up by a bit less than 30 cents within two months. The only difference was instead of that money going to the government it went to the fuel companies, and then the price of fuel jumped again when the tax was introduced. I'm quite sure the same would happen in Australia, and all the fuel companies will say "well people were able to pay that before, so let's just charge them that anyway!"
68. Ah yes, tax cuts for businesses, they are after all so well known for passing savings on to consumers.
69. WE KNOW ITS ABOUT SENDING A MESSAGE change their stance federally or the same will happen at the federal election.
70. >where are your numbers from? r/rectallysourcedstatistics
71. My point is 40 is no where near a boomer. 40 is millennial. The youngest millennial are closer to generation alpha (some of which haven't been born yet) than a 40 yo to a boomer. Millennial is current 28-43yo's. I'm guessing you're z? And pretty much every gen x and millennial I know is worried for you guys and supports policies that would make life better, or give opportunities, z and alpha are our children and we want good things for you
72. You're failing in your sarcasm because you're talking to someone who reads. If you haven't read what you voted for, it's not on me to educate you.
73. Well if QLD becomes a less desirable place to live due to LNP policies, people leave and less come to live here and the price of your house tanks
74. There are considerable numbers of people who want to leave the state depending on the outcome of abortion access. That means less demand on the QLD side and lower house valuation.
75. If you change the conversation from “feed anyone who wants it (and you say gets berated for it) to give it to everyone regardless” it changes it drastically. It’s the exact same thing with school uniforms. Poor families can’t afford new nikes and whatever so enforcing a school uniform directly helps the poorer kids from bullying etc. Anyway I was for and you’re against. Let’s leave it at that.
76. [deleted]
77. Unfortunately this. "Austerity measures"
78. We saw it here with the QLD 8 centre rebate, no need to wonder, we wouldn't see any of it
79. Then the government taxes every ship that ports to the hilt and passes that on. There are fixes, fuel companies in Australia have very little power, they are retail only as we have closed almost all our refineries, I think there’s only 4 left? 4 refineries in the whole country that completely relies on fuel to transport everything. We bring everything in so the government can force companies to play the game. Just no one has the balls to do it.
80. The government has powers to force things to happen, just no one has the balls to do it. Even if the government don’t, the buyers can. People aren’t dumb, if fuel goes down but prices stay high then vote with your wallet and buy elsewhere. Big tip, don’t shop anywhere that has shareholders. Profits will always take precedence over anything else because the share price is all that matters.
81. >ITS ABOUT SENDING A MESSAGE DOES YOUR EMAIL NOT WORK!?
82. That is the dumbest statement.
83. Literally the most brain dead take I’ve read on here. Way to cut off your nose to spite your face
84. Oh yeah, that will work. They’re super afraid of you and your ignorance about how the government actually works. 🙄
85. Again, never said they were Boomers, or even boomerish. Just pointing out the median age was over 40, so half the people are older than that. Take away all the kids and the median voting age would get closer to 50. From my anecdotal experience it's around 60 that some people start struggling with critical thinking and being easily swayed by media(mainstream or social). Which will be close to 1/3 of the voting bloc (though who knows what % of them have a significant conservative bias) And age is only one of the issues which sway people conservative. Location, religion, education are all big factors as well.
86. You may be able to read but unfortunately it seems comprehension is out of your reach.
87. Can you honestly see the amount of people leaving qlders over access to abortion would be so high that it would drop property prices? I can't see that..not at all..
88. So you’re advocating that we literally force children to eat food they don’t want to eat? Like drag them to the kitchen it’s served from and hold them down and force it down their throats to make sure everyone is equal? We cook up a lunch. It is available to any student who decides they would like to eat the food provided that day. Whether they also have tuckshop or food from home or not. Any student who comes by. We still have kids go downtown to steal food. It is the school staff who get verbally abused by the students. Not the students getting berated by staff.
89. Most children are already sufficiently provided for, so there isn't going to be some major change. I think you are being overly dramatic. I don't know what so hard about parents that can afford to feed their children doing so, and support being provided for those who can't. I would argue your position makes even less sense, as the more support you provide to those that don't need it. Then you have even less resources left to provide even more targeted support to those that need it.
90. This is why people don't listen to you. When you run out of canned insults, maybe you'll be useful.
91. I'm not leaving, but I'm definitely getting a vasectomy so I'm not beholden to hoping the religious crazies don't do what they always do.
92. You're arguing against points no-one is making, I'd suggest going back and reading what the other person is actually saying.
93. The person who started the personal attacks gets butthurt. We have well and truly reached the limit of your ability in this conversation.
94. It ain't over yet. Berkman could still just hold on and South Brisbane could remain green if the LNP get second (assuming their vote increases from the pre poll) As for why? Combination of being to ambitious and unaware that their previous victories were narrow. Instead of sandbagging, they chose to stretch their resources thin in unwinable seats. Also Adam Brandt's populism doesn't appeal to a lot of the leafy suburbs in maiwar. A repeat of the BCC results really. Also Miles was more progressive than standard labor, so why would a progressive vote green when they could vote for Labor (free lunch, 50c fares, etc) As for Federal greens they should be terrified in Ryan, at this rate its almost certain LNP gain
95. I think the Greens failed on two, maybe three key fronts. First and foremost their state election campaign was very much focused on federal issues. Rent freezes, and capping grocery prices aren't particularly popular policies in inner Brisbane, outside of The Greens 15 - 20% core voters. Moreover the reason Maiwar and South Brisbane flipped to the Greens originally was due to a focus on broadly popular local issues (improving public transport, new schools, free school lunches, urban revitalisation of traffic sewers etc). It was an absurd strategy misstep to focus on broadly unpopular, unrealistic, unimplimentable, economically illiterate federal policies. Secondly, the Greens won their QLD state and Federal Brisbane seats due to middle aged suburbanites and preference flows. I.e. much of Greens support is soft support. If they want to win seats they need to be careful to avoid marginalising centre-left voters by obstructing fairly progressive federal Labor policies, by being overly critical of Labor in general (i.e. the Greens ad calling out a handful of Labor MPs who voted against abortion), and by focusing on divisive (and ultimately unwinnable) issues like Israel/ Palestine, and Rent Freezes. Thirdly, they ceded a lot of bread and butter policy to Labor with 50c public transport fairs, and free school lunches. I believe The Greens would have had a very different result if their focus had been on local issues like a westside bus network expansion to reduce school traffic in Maiwar, a new school on the westside to reduce overcrowding, a green pedestrian corridor from woolongabba to southbank regardless of the stadium outcome, etc.
96. Not a great campaign from the Greens. The election was basically voters punishing Labor for their part in the cost of living crisis, but when the Miles government announced more progressive policy the Greens became redundant and couldn’t get their message out to differentiate. The only Greens policy I heard of was free public transit which seemed unnecessary when Labor had made it basically free. Also think the abortion debate moved other progressives to Labor as a reward for legalisation. Don’t think federal politics had much to do with the state election results but will give Labor some hope of winning back their lost Brisbane seats.
97. ALP: fix the roads LNP: privatise the roads GRN: free palestine
98. ~~Inability~~ unwillingness to compromise. Perfect greens policies being the enemy of labor good policies, and refusal to negotiate or support a meeting at half-way. Federal greens better pay attention.
99. Honestly? They need more actual working class people at all levels of the party. And regional working class. Nearly every single green policy could be used for regional areas in a good way and create support for them but you walk into a meeting in muddy boots and talk like a farm worker or tradie or deckhand and you're socially unwelcome, let alone putting forward issues with policy. I come from primary industry and working class family. There's a way to talk about renewables, protection for the environment, and all that, which will get support from nationals and even one nation. But instead we get theory and some truly unreal takes from people who don't have the experience to talk about it with the workers. Most primary industry do want sustainable practices. Working the land to death and destroying your catch and all that is not something they want. But you have to be able to listen and not respond to racism and misogyny etc*, and hatred of red tape, and all that, in order to get there. You can't launch into a lecture on intersectionality and micro aggressions when doing outreach, or have your trauma moment. Not when you actually fucking agree on the central issue. A big part of that was obvious with the youth crime discourse. Looking at the stats properly makes some shit really clear. It is vastly different between areas - but also that spike up north? Literally the result of less than a dozen recidivist kids. There are ways to discuss this that aren't just "free lunch will solve it" or "racial bias caused this" that do honour the trauma victims go through. While still being cognizant that the data and the research is pretty clear on what works to reduce crime. I'm a traitor to my class in a lot of ways now, what with the education and my career. I can talk theory and I can call out linguistic misogyny, and lateral violence, and I know my studies and how to support my arguments. But that's all fucking *irrelevant* to outreach. It's listening and being able to find common ground. Greens are often bad enough at finding it that I do agree with a lot of their policies, or I'm even more left, and I come out of conversation with supporters or party members hugely disgruntled and aware of how unwelcome me and people like me are. (And don't get me fucking started on disability policies, those tend to be very divided between Greens and lived experience, in a way that's genuinely ableist and ignorant) *The kind old school version, where their Vietnamese mate Hung and those guys are okay, and Sally the captain is a fucking fine woman, but have some slurs while they talk about it and why those people are different to the general category)
100. Miles moved Labor left
101. Green fatigue has well and truly set in.Too many protests and division from that quarter in an era where people want stability.
102. I have a feeling they just got out of touch for alot of voters, putting too much energy in divisive issues and not actually doing anything for the voters in electorates.
103. Greens need to narrow the focus of their messaging. There's absolutely no point wasting media time talking about Gaza or Israel. We don't really actually care when rent is rising and groceries for two adults cost $300/wk now. - clean environment - tax big corporate more tax small business less - help GPs with bulk billing on Medicare so it's more accessible - add dental to Medicare - housing crisis needs addressing and it ain't rent caps. We need to build more. Full stop. - stop immigration ffs, just for a while as we let everything catch up
104. Actually not sure why Berkman is losing Maiwar now, unless they expect a hefty ALP preference flow to go LNP instead of Greens. That's even if you assume 100% of ON goes to LNP. Am I missing something? Last election's ALP preference flow to GRN was ~80%. Berkman is still ahead with that math and 100% ON to LNP.
105. It's obvious to me that the federal Greens have been punished for letting perfection be the enemy of good regarding the cost of living and housing.
106. Ex-green voter. South Brisbane I decided to return to the ALP because to me the Greens are more a party of protest lately. The way they criticise and vote against ALP especially in the federal government is counter intuitive.
107. Turns out being a party of NIMBYs who can't get anything done makes you undesirable. They need to cut out the weirdos like Sri who seems to be happier as a militant than a politician and come up with some genuine policies that don't revolve around fantasy and are actually viable. Yes it would be lovely to tax every big company 100% of their profits and we all get free everything forever and ever and sing Kumbaya on Queen Street but that's not real life.
108. One of the commentators last night made a great point. Gen Z voters have never seen the “Bob Brown protect the wilderness” Greens. They’ve only ever seen the current “say no to everything “ Greens and see that they have no intention to actually drive any change.
109. Their primary vote stayed pretty much the same statewide, so let's not get carried away with the doom and gloom like they've been rejected completely
