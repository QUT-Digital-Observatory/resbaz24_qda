Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. I know a single parent whose rent skyrocketed to $1000/fortnight and they get a total of $1200 a fortnight from Centrelink. So that leaves $200 a fortnight for all other expenses. She has two jobs, both of which require childcare to get to. So the moment that a child is sick, there’s no way to get to work. The father is also digging his heels in and refusing to pay child support. And yes, she’s applied for other jobs, most of which don’t want a single parent because jobs still don’t like parents, let alone single parents. Even 20 years ago when I was a kid, before the cost of everything was fucked, the expectation was that parents/older kids would skip meals so the younger ones could eat. So yeah, I’m more than happy for my tax dollars to go towards feeding public school kids than subsidising rich wankers at Marist college to get another pool.
2. This comment shows a lack of empathy to be honest. It's shortsighted to say that all those parents are crap like that. Sure you have a small subset of people who spend it on drinks and smokes etc. but you also have people who genuinely have to choose between food for themselves and paying rent. I grew up in a town which had some real poverty and it's not always down to "alcohol and smokes". Even if their parents are spending it all on drinking and smoking do those kids deserve to go hungry? It all comes back to caring for all members of a society, children can't exactly go and get a job and buy their own lunches in these cases.
3. Can't tell if you're serious. 2 billion to feed kids is really not much compared to the other bullshit we spend money on.
4. Say it with me now. Hungry. Children. If we let kids go hungry they are far more.likelynto drop out, commit crimes and get up to general mischief, I would argue it's 2 billion well spent. Feeding kids leads to better outcomes for society as a whole. Also helps knock the (already falling) youth crime numbers lower, because kids are more likely to stay in school. With the average youth in a detention facility costing the state approx 760k per year, we are currently spending almost 300 million each year for youth lockup. Cutting this, plus feeding kids and limiting future offenders sounds like a great deal for $2b.
5. Are you aware of how much money the government spends on Defence? Over $50 billion dollars p/y last time I checked. Over 25 times what they were proposing to spend on feeding children. Don’t pretend to care about how much stuff costs if you have no problem with over 50 billion dollars going towards weapons etc. but are up in arms about school children getting a meal.
6. i assume you mean lnp have the numbers to stop it from going further
7. Yes, but LNP MPs have overwhelmingly voted against abortion access/decriminalisation and right now there is no guarantee they won't do it again.
8. That's fair on the housing front, but not like LNP would be a better option there.
9. enjoy the "melt down" I hope you got your jollies mate
10. They seemed to be doing just fine by most metrics, all we have to do is see if the LNP does better without resorting to their usual tactic - sell everything that isn't nailed down.
11. > Fkn helllll. So yous had a good gov that took responsibility and that wasn’t good enough? Basically, they weren't fantastic by any measure but they were at least making progress and working on making positive changes, we decided to burn it all down because we were bored or some sort of inane reason. > The abortion bill etc seems to be a hot topic atm, what else are they tryna pass? They plan to scrap the recently added mining royalties which were funding a decent amount of our programs, they've plans to absolutely gut the Healthcare sector, similar with the Education, everything else is all up in the air as they went to the election with sweet fuck all as actual policy beyond "kids are totally doing all the crime and we're the only ones who can stop it!". But given the LNP bullshit we've always dealt with they'll likely say fuck off to the lunches for school kids program, they'll scrap the 50c public transport program, they'll push forward on the abortion issue as well as trans related health care, they'll gut near every industry they can and push even more towards privatisation, etc... > I’m actually moving to Australia on Tuesday, arriving Wednesday lol (only whv tho so shouldn’t impact me much) I hope the flight isn't too much of a hassle, it's a long'un :)
12. Fair, there's a section of their voter base that has invested into new projects. But there's also a section that only has the one property, that section benefits from no new builds.
13. > 250k jobs flipping lollipops If you honestly believed this to be true, why are you not doing it?
14. If the example is traffic controllers getting 250k a year... Then that's not the best example to prove you point. Because it's totally made up. However, from.your example. it sounds like the issue is to much work on, and in demand workers can pick and choose the best paid work... Don't know the answer to that.. more migration?
15. One of the few places in the Australian economy where unskilled workers can still make good pay is in the construction industry.. and construction is hard work, it's risky, it can be dangerous. Workers take no risk? Jumping from project to project, companies disappearing and reapearing under a different name... Contacting companies are all like a house of cards. I am not really sure what you suggest, should workers just work harder, overtime free, weekend for no extra pay? For what it's worth, I think it's the high value of land that is ultimately poisonous for Australia, too many aspiring land bankers who don't want to work.
16. People are free to post LNP positive stuff. Instead, they'd rather complain that it's an echochamber but never do anything to change that. If you're worried about downvotes or ridicule on the internet, the internet probably isn't the place for you. People are genuinely asking the question about why people vote LNP and no one is answering, they just say it's an echochamber and that's it.
17. Well it'd be a nice change to the combative and childish "I'm bathing in leftist tears" comments I've seen today. I think it's a great question and would love to see nuanced answers.
18. What are some of the reasons tho?
19. As I said, ask stupid questions, win stupid prizes.
20. You are saying your drivel is a "stupid prize"? 🥴 You're not very good at this.
21. Well it would seem a lot of people need a reminder that the 50’s weren’t the “good old days” they seem to remember…
22. So, don't fix the problem, just hide them in adult jails.
23. You're right, we DO need a development program for really scary grown up criminals!
24. I think there are like 6 people still active on Facebook, if you discount the bots and boomers. It's a hive of generative AI content and villainy.
25. ??? There was a parliamentary vote on gay marriage I think in 2012? Labor had a conscience vote on it but it failed because the liberals and nationals voted no as a block. Also in 2017 when we finally did pass it (after the liberals made us have a public debate on the issue!), more Labor MPs voted yes to it than coalition ones.
26. Agree. I went to both catholic and public schools in QLD in the 90s/00s and cannot for the life of me recall ever been taught anything about politics.
27. I haven’t seen that philosophy exhibited much in politics and certainly not in the LNP campaign going to this election. At least Miles gave it a try but I think he just didn’t have any cut though in with mainstream media.
28. Pretty tough to put that in place without it becoming insanely politicised to the point of being more trouble than to begin with.
29. I mean, I get your point, but I'd even take issue with the core concept; How much of what we hear fits the exact media playbook I mentioned earlier of repetitive familiarisation advertising and smear campaigns? I've never been to check, but I have also never been bombed into submission so I don't know if that is the natural response.
30. Commie China is run by engineers ironically
31. Youth crime certainly is an issue; the [stats](https://www.qgso.qld.gov.au/statistics/theme/crime-justice/crime-justice-statistics/recorded-crime) speak for themselves. If you don’t want to read the stats ask the next copper you meet on the street how bad youth crime actually is.
32. A person is great, people are dumb.
33. Stewart Lee
34. The idiots are (have) taking over
35. I’ve certainly done my duty on those nationalists.
36. Isn't labor the party that said that a virus was going to "hunt you down and find you"? Im sure any arkansas inbred could cut through that argument pretty quickly. What were we left with? A state full of virus fearing deadbeat green leftists, who feel its their duty to mandate what people inject themselves with. The economic impact of covid and the soft on crime approach didnt resonate with the population and they have been booted as a result. I was locked up longer than someone who decides to rob a house because i dared to cross a border.
37. Plus, people who vote for a party because that's what their parents did aren't exactly engaged and would probably not bother.
38. If you take away compulsory voting then it will be even more weaponized who gets to vote. The US looks way worse than us. The best approach is education. I’m disappointed in this result, but I’d push for less media and less money in politics before I push for limiting who can vote.
39. By the same token we could have licences to make sure only people who are fit to be parents are allowed to breed. Sure there’s a lot of arguments that can be made in favour of these things but it’s hugely fraught with ethical problems and furthermore you can’t pretend to be operating a democratic system of government once these sorts of measures are implemented. Just about every election calls to mind the Winston Churchill quote “democracy is the worst form of government – except for all the others that have been tried.”
40. The greatest issues with non compulsory voting are that campaigns have to focus on encouraging people to vote rather than promoting the reasons why to vote for them. It also opens the door for voter suppression. As the US is a great example of, non compulsory voting doesn’t stop idiots and lunatics from voting, in fact it may encourage them to by pandering to greater extremes. Having to cast a vote, under compulsory voting, isn’t the same as having to cast a legitimate vote. There is an option for people to protest or refrain whilst still showing up. I would probably like there to be an option of “unsure” at the top of the ballot to encourage people who have no clue to not make decisions for the rest of us. In terms of the how to vote card, that is strictly for parties to work out their own preference deals. You don’t have to follow it but it does help in estimating who’s going to win the two party preferred based on first preferences
41. Okay… but the LNP are their preferred party. QLD just voted in the party that was paid the most money by those few people with all the money that cause the most issues. So if you’re wondering why we can’t have nice things that’s your answer.
42. > So why can’t we have a cleaner inner city Because we're talking about literal human beings and not rubbish you utter weirdo.
43. I don't even know how to respond to this, is this sarcasm? And like, why? Why can't we just have a reasonable discussion about why people vote the way they do and maybe learn something instead of whatever this is?
44. I find it very presumptuous to assume that because they are politically lazy, they don't care about my life or difficulties. I love my family and have been incredibly supportive all through my life. We voted on different policy, we don't have to wish suffering upon each other. I made my original comment on this post to help give some insight into the LNP voters that are in my life. They are very normal people, they have jobs, study to do and other priorities. I believe that more people should be politically conscious and I've tried to encourage that in my family without picking a fight. But, with all that said, I've just had someone publicly state online that they wish that my family suffers. That surely crosses a line. I'm asking you directly now, do you honestly believe that it's acceptable to publicly wish suffering upon someone. I think that is completely fucked up.
45. It goes both ways
46. And Murdoch famously hates.
47. If you think they have to much influence wait till you hear about the minerals council the IPA and the business council.
48. Yes, how dare the working class push back against huge construction companies about things like safety…
49. You say this as if the bosses don't have a singular power to end a strike in an instant. Even union leaders are at the mercy of their members. The whole reason a strike occurs is because all other avenues to negotiate have failed. Where is the same smoke for the greedy bosses?
50. This is a wild take, you know unions are in most industries and rarely ever do any of those things but is generally a last resort?
51. Don’t look into the media or mining then! Let’s hope you are as passionate and voting aligns with that more so.
52. You've never worked a hard day in your life.
53. From what you understand? Suggest you actually look at the data which shows disputes are historically low.
54. Only one branch did that? All other branches have been affected though. Staff have been let go and banned from entering the industry for up to 5 years. With no proof btw.
55. Not any more
56. Not this time, Labor really turned and did a number on us. Probably why their donations were down as well. No union would’ve given them any donations this time, well maybe the AWU.
57. So they voted green ?! I know Max from Green pop in the protest and I was shocked that lefties stand together with those gangs……
58. I upvoted you because someone else downvoted and I think downvoted an effort post is always a shitty and cowardly move. You put in a lot of your time and they click a button. Anyway I hate landlords and probably disagree with you on some points but I wasn't aware of the watchdog thing and it's certainly a valid point.
59. But the thing is, all the other unions are still pushing Labor. Seems like it was an unspoken thing in the union world that the CFMEU was a stain on the entire union movement in Australia. Turns out all you have to do to not go into to administration is be associated with criminal gangs, launder money, harass people and engage in vast amounts of corruption.
60. > Unions do have a place but I have first hand experince of them meeting at a maccas and saying stuff like "lets fuck them up" while planning work disruption What exactly is the problem here? That's an extremely common thing to say and in no way indicative of a negative? > ive been spoken to in an intimidatory way by a union high up who wasnt even across the facts What a completely vague nothing, so nondescript as to be useless. > ive had a union rep say no when i told them they should take the fight on behalf of an employee. Did you bring it to other reps attention, or raise it at the union meeting? > Many union reps are great but your statements are ignorant to reality. How, you've not actually provided literally any example of how it is beyond some literal nothing statements. > Are you seriously arguing that the only people who get pissed off at union action are managers who want to exploit workers? Lol. Yes, or those who guzzled down anti union propaganda, unions exist to protect and uplift workers.
61. I think he just massively misread the room. All the people he spoke to were probably complaining about the cost of a new stadium, and so, he thought that a watered-down stadium plan that would save a couple hundred million dollars by making use of existing venues would appeal to voters. What he neglected to consider is the fact that Brisbane is in need of a new stadium regardless of the Olympics, and his QSAC plan wouldn’t actually leave the city with any legacy infrastructure.
62. Here's hoping. Will probably be the only positive thing to come out of this government
63. Fingers crossed
64. Yeah hope this is the case. Labor commissioned quirk to do the work then ignored it. Was crazy stupid
65. Probably true. And I have reservations about spending 3B on a new stadium. If seq spend is going to be smaller. Would rather the cash spent on more busways and rails at least.
66. Oh hes made many decisions, just take everything he said during this election and think of the opposite eg. "Its not part of our plan" = "it is part of our plan"
67. public hospitals tender contracts for fucking shitloads of things lmao, you're delusional. I support Australia and QLD's system of public healthcare, I am simply recognising the government's absolute right to make whatever staffing arrangements they see fit given their mandate. public hospitals already have private staff working in them, many of whom are doctors. as for research, why do we need to fund it? it's not like all health research worldwide will stop if we stop funding it.
68. if there's a need for the job then the private sector can provide it. I'm not even anarchocap, I know there are services which require public funding, but if even nursing is not on that list I really doubt your partner was.
69. While reducing ambulance ramping? It will be interesting to see how that works out for them
70. Haha I call him christafullashit
71. Oh cool, meanwhile the closest large hospital in our region still has no cath lab, so cardiac patients have the option of hopefully being airlifted to hospital 4 hours away or dying. Cool cool cool.
72. I'd say that there would be a good chance as you'll be studying for about 4 years, in which time there will be another election, and the Qld LNP don't have a great record as of late for getting re-elected for a second term.
73. It’s those in the frontline that are mostly safe
74. There might be a job but you'll be chronically short staffed, underpaid, and unappreciated. 🥲
75. Don’t worry about whether this a job for you or not. Worry whether you will burn out.
76. Don't be turned off by it, healthcare is one of the best fields for graduate employment. You'll find a job.
77. Yeah poor people deserve to die hey mate
78. One part of the stupidity of the cycle is governments restrict the part of the budget departments get for headcount (LNP because they want small govt and ALP because they are scared of the LNP carrying on about too many public servants). Both sides then expect the public service to deliver services and the only option then is to hire contractors to deliver certain packages of work that would in the past have been delivered by a public servant. cue the cycle of increasing 'contractor costs' instead of actually hiring someone to do the work.
79. Strange way to try and comprehend but you do you boo
80. ‘Loving’ was the worst possible typo you could make there
81. Hear me out.. why don't we have a name and shame list for .. wait for it... Sex offenders? If u diddle with the innocent you don't deserve privacy. Not saying it should be a full on " this guy lives here" but a name and shame at least would give the community some relief and also give warning to any child or woman or whatever information and knowledge on whos dangerous and lurking around Not sure what peeing in public has to do with any of that...unless they are right near a school or playground?
82. Because it's not permanent but drastically reduces suicide attempts. It just hits pause to prevent dysphoria while they process their decision to move forward or not. It's life saving care and can be stopped at anytime
83. If you figure out that your body is “wrong” your mind is “wrong” and you have the choice between agony, addiction, eating disorders and possibly death, or puberty blockers, I hope the puberty blockers are available to you.
84. You chose the most rejected and flawed report to make your point. The Cass report denied evidence on the basis that studies did not use randomised control tests or double blind studies. As you can imagine it's not possible, nor ethical, to conduct blind RCTs on puberty. People tend to notice if their voice starts cracking or if breasts start growing >sexual reassignment surgery I don't even know why I'm bothering with someone who thinks this is a thing
85. Well said. Seems that the misinformation has been making the rounds that it’s the safer and proven thing to do- yet the evidence actually says to the contrary. I forget the statistic but it was those who undergo gender affirmation surgery at something of an order of magnitude of ten - more likely to commit suicide later. It’s pretty messed up it’s being pushed on the kids- I have no problem with LGBTQIA+ community, all my friends since I was a kid, most are gay. I have trans family. Lots of people are getting mad at the lgbt community for the pushing it onto kids etc., and i keep reminding them don’t blame them, it’s not their fault. Most are just as brainwashed and it’s horrible, no different to how I’m brainwashed in other respects; but besides the point - there’s clearly an agenda here and we, the people, are being used as pawns to push and fight eachother over it. I hope everyone can feel comfortable with their body and their mind, I don’t care what they do- so long as it doesn’t involve me or try to make me change my life - great. You do you. But the governments / corporate bodies using us for their agenda is bullshit and needs to stop.
86. This isn't a left or right discussion. There is no economic component here, it is medical science, and as much as some politicians pretend, it is not their expertise
87. It's kool aid, and yep, was tasty and got me through my uni courses that centred around critical thinking and material analysis!
88. You do know there’s a whole range of medical reasons these medications are prescribed right? Including for severely disabled children who have hormone imbalances that lead to early-onset puberty, as well as applications in the treatment of certain medical conditions and cancer in children?
89. The benefit of reduced suicide outweighs the negatives (which is how every medical intervention is assessed).
90. Yup that's the big issue. At the moment the proposal is basically to cut through from the new "Caboolture West" through farms and houses at the back of Caboolture and Elimbah, and link it back up to Beerburrum Road within 500m of the Elimbah School with a possible link to Steve Irwin and the Bruce further north under Stage 5 (still in development). Our proposal as a community has been to keep it further west, follow the existing electricity corridor, go through the forestry and link it up to Steve Irwin Way properly. That way it still serves the purpose of ringroading Caboolture and serves as a better Bruce Highway alternative for people in the north of Brisbane, but has less impact on lives and communities.
91. > I'm just reminding people it's not the end of the world Jesus. Except this is a thread asking the reasons people have heard for those voting for the LNP. > Does the idea of a registery scare you? Way to miss my point entirely. > Edit:Nevermind just saw you're a vegan Ok?
92. My bad, the reddit app didn't update all comments after I initially loaded the thread. Just read through that document you linked. Did we read the same document? We're talking about LNP's plan right? I see a lot of yellow question marks denoting "Not a clear plan/position" under the LNP column. Also to point out that the Labor response was 10 pages of actual plan and information, versus the 3 page email from LNP with no real details? To your TAFE example, the LNP says that "Over the last nine years, Labor has missed their apprenticeship target by 17,600." and then go on to state that "LNP is committed to improving apprenticeship completions and boosting Queensland's skilled workforce" But...then they don't actually expand on HOW they intend to do that? Where have the LNP actually stated what their plan is? It really seems like they through together this 3 page email response to QTU's questions, filled it with empty promises and no actual plans. Anyone can say "Yep we'll fix that, right as rain", but how can you believe that they will when they haven't shown us HOW they will fix it?
