Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. The 3rd party spending for the LNP is a loophole that has to be removed. It's not a democracy when the rich get more of a say, it's something else. But I'm pissed off at this aside; >parties are also eligible for public funding of a portion of their campaigns. I was reading over changes that were slated a few years ago, and I'm pretty sure they are now in effect. The hoops you have to jump though are now absurdly complicated, tantamount to a ban. It's a reimbursement. You have to guess how many votes you'll get and take out a loan or seek donations to spend the money upfront. If you underestimate your vote and don't spend enough then that potential money is gone. If you overestimate your vote you're in the red, you spent money and no reimbursement. And what about if you get 30% of the vote in a seat and 10% of the vote in another? Can you shuffle that spending around? No. You have to spend where you got the votes or no reimbursement. You could simultaneously underestimate your vote in some areas and overestimate in others, burning money you could have earned in some areas but being left in debt in others. Even more crucially the reimbursement is now far more specific on what counts as campaign expenditure. Hiring somebody to organise volunteers? Nope. Renting a campaign office? Nope. Only the cost of material and media that ends up seen by the eyes or heard by the ears of voters counts. TV ads, pamphlets, billboards, etc. My cynical take is Labor don't rely on directly hiring volunteer organisers or campaign offices, they use their affiliated unions that have a different revenue stream. It was only the Greens who were bankrolling a ground campaign through the reimbursements, so Labor removed it.
2. You misspelt bribes in your title.
3. I haven't witnessed such saltiness since my glorious trip to Siberia.
4. That's because Labor and the Greens are terrible for jobs and Industry in general.
5. No sure what is worse if the coal companies or the CFMEU and other unions
6. Good - labour get a lot more on the ground support from unions and community groups because they fund them . University’s , activist groups , government die hard employees that know there jobs cushy jobs on the line with liberals .

8. animal justice party doing good this year
9. The LNP just like its interstate and federal counterparts, the libs and nats has absolutely no purpose except to take donations and return the favours to big business, industry lobby groups, religious nutters, the born to rule, the uneducated and people who will happily vote against their own best interests. Much like those disturbing and disturbed Trump cultists.
10. The scariest part is that people have donated nearly $1m to the Greens 🤯
11. When can we stop posting election stuff. All the LNP and Labor shills are out into it slurping away at their masters Peens.
12. How many Australians are employed by or in supporting rolls to the mining companies?
13. So fucking what?
14. So sporting teams are cool with donations but it’s this massive issue in politics - it does suck but it’s a reality - seriously how can they execute change without donations ? And what constitutes a corporation? So it’s okay to take from “small businesses”
15. Long live king coal
16. >any party affiliated persons not allowed within 200m of an active polling station. How will they vote? 🤔
17. Long live the king
18. I'm giving way more thought to your offhand comment than I should but honestly this blanket demonisation of people involved in politics is reductive and doesn't help people engage with policies and voting and how it affects their lives. I have volunteered at election booths for every election for the last 5 years and have found most political volunteers are everyday people who genuinely believe in the party they are working for, or they have a personal connection to the party, e.g. families who campaigned for the 'one punch kills' laws a few years back. It's the last moment to change someone's mind and you can often have some good conversations, even on election day. I would agree with the political advertising except that most Australians are not going to research their parties using third party platforms; If we stop political advertising we are relying on the general public to get their information from the Murdoch media and other bullshit, that funds only one side of the political spectrum.
19. All of these restrictions only serve to entrench the existing parties. How did the teals win several Liberal seats in the last fed? Heaps of money, lots of advertising and big, annoying campaigns. I live in the ACT and David Pocock spent millions of dollars on ads and had dozens of volunteers at polling booths. If you essentially make campaigning illegal, nobody will ever be able to convince people NOT to vote for the current parties. The whole point of democracy is to let people proactively contest the government of the day. If you find democracy so annoying, move somewhere that doesn't have it.
20. You don't need to make political advertising illegal. You just need to change the laws so that lying in political advertising is illegal (it's reduce the ads by the same amount) 😆
21. I want to give you the job immediately.
22. Please add a mandatory score card for every political party on promises made vs complied with/carried out.
23. If you read behind the lines, they're pretty much just the political wing of the QLD resources council and are quite transparent about it. idk why that sits well with so many people - almost as if most of our media is also the propaganda wing for the resources council too 🤔
24. Some people just want to be followers.
25. I reckon deep down they pretty much hate each other too.
26. They aren’t just working for their donors interests. They’re also working for their own investment portfolio’s too.
27. You were born into a society that was already captured. If anything we're just better at spotting it. We haven't stopped it yet, but we've spotted it.
28. Adding to this, Byerwen Coal mine is operated by QCoal and they are in dispute with the current government over the camp at the site. The camp is not compliant with the planning laws and the Labor government passed a law basically ordering the closure of the camp, and for workers to move to Glenden a town near by. Adding in to this Byerwen was recently shut down after having multiple fatalities on the site. So to anyone else seeing this post and thinking "Fuck you mining companies" keep in mind that both those large donations come from individuals that have an axe to grind with the current government and aren't representative of the wider industry.
29. Thanks for your insight
30. I can tell you from personal experience, Nick Jorss is a jerk. He has his greedy fingers in lots of businesses. His loyalty is to himself only & his goal is money at all costs. God 🤦‍♀️ I hope the LNP loose.
31. I work in community services, linked with Child Safety. I know if LNP get in there will be cuts to service delivery and I lose my job. Despite the fact our services at capacity and we still have overflow of need… This is actually genuinely scary.
32. >The LNP "costings" have revealed Crisafulli plans to cut $6.8 Billion from the Public Service. Where abouts can I read more on this? From what I've been able to find the cuts are to consultants, not frontline workers like Newman.
33. That’s the spirit.
34. I see your reddit witch group was mentioned here. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDlfH5yhAts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDlfH5yhAts)
35. Yep the mainstream misinformation it's a sad state of affairs.
36. The mining lobby has been spending big on ads for the last 10mths they want Qlders money for themselves.
37. Far better to accept money from the people protecting workers rights over the money from mining Barrons.
38. No, it doesn’t…they do it on the third party for millions & then can claim they don’t raise as much as the LNP…
39. Apparently amongst the unions up to $15million was made available. But there’s a $1million cap per third party.
40. If you read the second graph, the biggest third-party contribution to pro-Labor advertising is the Mining and Energy Union at about $150k, and the total third-party spend on them is approx $300k. That should largely reflect the trade union funding into the campaign.
41. Looks like the left side is donations, sorted by size (biggest at the top) going to recipients on the right (biggest on top). The one on the top-right isn't even labelled, so it's a bit useless. Generally a shit graph, but yeah that's what it is. Coal Australia donated $1,239,025 and $682,600 went to Australian Institute for Progress and $495,000 went to Australians for Prosperity, etc etc
42. It's deliberately misleading. The OP is a Labor staffer. Have a gander at it's post history. Just another blow-in that turns up around every state or federal election.
43. They’re small, they wouldn’t be in every seat
44. What's the point in posting it here at the dead end of a old thread? Put it up in a fresh thread Wally
45. Me.. "huh?" You got me there lol
46. You might want to check in on the latest job figures.
47. Are you capable of thinking for yourself?
48. Well, as I see it, the mining companies are trying to put yet more cash in their owners pockets. The unions are trying to put more cash in the workers pockets. I'm pretty clear about which one is worse, personally.
49. I am sure the CFMEU got that 22% over 3 year deal because they are such a neutral group. Surely nothing is happening behind the scenes.
50. Only one entity you’ve mentioned has been shown to be involved in money laundering
51. Is that you Gina on the karaoke machine?
52. Are you seriously trying to compare community sporting groups- with no ability to change laws - with the LNP/political parties? And really, I mean really, not see any issues with companies buying favours?
53. Postal voting exists, problem solved
54. I was going to say except for them going to vote, or clarify that they'd just not be allowed to campaign etc, as I assumed that was all self evident.
55. Sorry, but you are simply giving far too much leeway for politicians to continue as corrupt and completely deaf to the needs of anyone who isn't a giant corporation. If you could make donations to judges, then the court system would be considered a joke. Period. There needs to be a level playing field that stops businesses from having such undue influence over government policies. Just because people cannot grasp the effect that this has, or that political parties don’t actually advocate policies in their best interest doesn’t change how the system works. Modern politics is dysfunctional and Kleptocratic in its current state. Simply, there are no excuses for lavish dinners, gifts, exorbitant political donations and cushy after-politics job for politicians.
56. I'm torn, should it be peninal/clitoral bleeding or just straight to beheadings that should be the punishment?!
57. You know what I dont get is.. I walk around the community sometimes and I see these people with LNP signs up on they houses or in the front lawns. They proud to tell the community they are putrid scums who support racism/elitism
58. The owner of QCoal, Chris Wallin, has some history as well. He worked for government in the Geological Survey, went out in the 90s to drill for coal to increase the government knowledge of coal deposits, quit soon afterwards and pegged/applied for coal permits over these new high grade deposits which ended up becoming profitable coal mines. The man has poor integrity.
59. It's all on the public record too.
60. I pre-polled and did place the Lying Nasty Party last. As that's where they place you. Hope they do not get in and you get to keep your job.
61. Why would LNP fund Child Safety and youth support programs when their campaign and popularity is built on demonising youth and amplifying the problem of youth crime? He needs youth to NOT be well…to rebel…and to resist…so he can feel justified in his tough (read: backwards) approach. It’s so frustrating to watch…knowing that broken systems and a society forced into individualism, capitalism and survival mode CREATES these “youth crime” problems, and THEN convinces everybody that the youth (and their parents) are actually the problem. OMFG. 🤬
62. You'd have to ask the LNP for more details. That's the problem with not releasing full policy details and costing details, there is zero clarity.
63. That was similar to what Newman was promising from memory. In reality what happened is anyone who was employed on a contract lost their job.
64. Well given the amount of lnp stuff I’m seeing compared to labor. I’d suggest the divide is wider than you are suggesting. For these companies. Getting rid of a mining tax, this is just chicken feed compared to the rewards on offer.
65. So you're saying I was just unlucky to see them in my electorate
66. Ah right of course, thanks.
67. This my friend is where you are wrong. The unions do it for themselves have you not seen any of the CFMEU issues? Unfortunately everyone involved is all about lining their own pockets. Unions, coal companies all of them. Don’t think either is innocent.
68. Keep dreaming that the CFMEU put more cash in the workers pockets, they are a fraud
69. Which part of spending union dues in strip clubs or getting so many kickbacks the Commonwealth Games were canceled is about getting more money in workers pockets?
70. Only one that stops the biggest projects in Australia and QLD whenever their boss did have a free coffee in the morning while collecting kickbacks
71. I don’t say it is right but do you seriously seriously thi k it will change? I’m making a comparison because they usually aren’t giving it out of completely unselfish motives They want a shout out or to be out on jerseys etc trying to bring awareness to their “business”
72. Most are already postal
73. If we've learned anything from the Yanks its not never do postal/mail-in voting. The last time they did it somehow elected a senile gently alive corpse and f\*cked the worlds economy, a senile old man who somehow amassed 10s of thousands of mail in votes in the final hours of the voting period in States that hate him and his parties guts. Lets not go there pls.
74. Beheadings are a bit too swift... just saying 🤷‍♂️
75. Yeah the costings are certainly light. Just don't like people and Miles saying with certainty that frontline workers will be cut when there's 0 mention of it.
76. The LNP are so proud of that. We have no royalties, no money to transition to a renewable economy and all the jobs that go with it. And they are proud they stopped us silly Australians asking a price on the resources we sell to them and overseas. We don't sell it, we give it away. For free. And the LNP are proud of that. We are dirt poor and they are proud they saved the shareholders in America from our demands.

77. funniest read I had was my union emailing us an election bulletin, which was 10 pages of why education in QLD is in crisis, and then asking us to vote labor as LNP will make it worst. Like labor isn't the reason we are in crisis. edit: look at those downvotes. everyone agrees education is in crisis and I hope everyone agrees that Labor been in charge for the last 9 years. Not sure how it's not labor fault we are in crisis
78. I guess it depends on how much you prefer making your own decisions vs the government telling you what to do.
79. Oh yeah how dare they want you to be free to make your own choices. Those bastards!
80. I've never been a union member, but I've known plenty of union organisers, across multiple unions. Every single one of them have been selfless and hardworking people, going above and beyond to make the workplace better for the employees. They didn't get anything financial out of their efforts. Are there some bad people in unions? For sure. But I'd also remember that big business, and the LNP have a vested interest in making the unions look like villains. Without unions, we wouldn't have weekends, a minimum wage, overtime or paid leave. Overall, unions have undoubtedly been a *hugely* positive influence on the western world.
81. still waiting for the cross river rail..oh yeah CFMEU can't let that be completed
82. Jeez lay off the fox news grandpa.
83. [deleted]
84. Hey Jack ass, it's because those states made sure the mail in voting was counted last, a rule brought in by republicans while telling their base to not mail in, deliberately so they can cry foul about the 'sudden jump' in mail in Democrat votes. And we already allow mail in voting.
85. "Grow a Brian, Moran" - Anon
86. you know the United States has a House of Representatives and a Senate right?
87. We could do peninal/clitoral bleeding, until death.
88. Fair enough. 2012 QLD Election: * Campbell Newman and LNP were light on policy details & costing details. * Campbell Newman and LNP promised lower taxes, lower debt, no new taxes, no funding cuts, no privatisation, & no public service cuts. * Campbell Newman and LNP backflipped on those promises immediately once in office and implemented his Austerity measures. 2024 QLD Election: * Crisafulli and LNP are light on policy details & costing details. * Crisafulli and LNP have promised lower taxes, lower debt, no new taxes, no funding cuts, no privatisation, & no public service cuts. * Crisafulli and his Shadow Cabinet of Bleijie, Frecklington, Nicholls, Mander, John-Paul Langbroek etc. were all senior Ministers in the Campbell Newman Government. Zero mention of X, Y, Z policies **before** an election is a feature, not a bug. We've seen this movie before. IMO, if Crisafulli was acting in good faith he would've been upfront about his policies, costings, and whether he will allow or deny an LNP conscience vote on criminalising Abortion.
89. I don’t think the LNP is advocating removing royalties - they were talking about rolling back the most recent changes made a couple of years back which brought in a top 40% rate. Based on the current coal price, this rate is a long way from Kicking in.
90. We’ve always had royalties.
91. LNP will solve the teacher shortage by making classes bigger. Sounds like a great idea. How will the solve the police and nurse shortage?
92. I do get a laugh that the Qld branch head & Ipswich West candidate for the Libertarian Party of Qld is so dedicated to people 'making their own choices' that his whole career has been devoted to influencing people's choices as a business marketer "*developing impactful digital and traditional strategies to drive customer engagement and sales outcomes*"; currently owns his own marketing company; and, prior to that, was a senior marketing manager for one of those dodgy 'classic car lottery' trade-promotions-masquerading-as-a-charity that's currently under investigation in NSW...
93. I 100% agree. I know some great ones also. The grass roots members. The everyday blokes that are not radicalised. Iv been in 3 EBA in my life. The ones at the top are as rotten as they come. Only care about increasing the number of union “tickets” they have. All three times they traded out great benefits for workers to increase things for the union. I also know a lot of business owners, who are fantastic bosses and employers who the unions have come and railed. They get one disgruntled staff. Unions get a seat with one or two members and it destroys them. You are right what the unions did. I think 20-30 years ago they had a place. They still do have a place to keep the status quo. But they keep pushing. Nothing is enough. Housing crises is a supply issue. Who causes that. Landlords get the hate. Immigrants. We need more skilled immigrants. Especially in the construction industry. Unions blocked that. They are a business and need to grow their fee intake. I could write the same about the bad iv seen big business do also. Don’t get me wrong. I’m just giving you the other side to your stance. I don’t need to tell you about their evil doings by the sound of your position.
94. It will get delayed even more from Sunday
95. Trump economy was the best in decades, that period of time from 2016 until covid fked everything was amazing, tf are you on about lmao
96. Wrong
97. https://imgur.com/gallery/get-brain-morans-O8ctOu6
98. Viscous, but fair 😆
99. I would welcome larger classes if it means like last time we had LNP government, teachers got more conditions and more pay. Unlike the last 6 years where we got a pay freeze, more work added, and now have 19 year olds who haven't passed a single year of a uni course teaching students unsupervised. we honestly can't get worst. Even if it does atleast we tried something different.
100. Sounds pretty sketchy, I'm a libertarian idealistically. Not necessarily a supporter of the party I found out existed in the above comment two hours ago.
101. So you admit COVID fucked everything?
102. So his policies that screwed everything up after he left aren’t his fault and the policies that led to the gains in his term term came from the previous term are his? Come on man, things looked good in the start of his term were all from the previous presidential decisions
103. Hey man, Trump is only 3 years younger than Biden.
104. 19 year olds who haven't completed a year of uni teaching unsupervised? Can you elaborate on that
105. Don’t even bother, account is 8 hours old. Probably disasterdecks latest alt account. Resident troll of Australian subreddits.
106. so under permission to teach program (PTT) if schools can prove they can't find a teacher they can hire someone who meets the PTT standards. Which is basically that they are making progress in education course (masters, or degree in education) or have other relevant work experience. https://www.qct.edu.au/registration/other-approval-permission-to-teach these PTT are suppose to be given extra spares and mentoring but take classes alone. I currently have one who teaches next to me, who started in term 3 after completing their first semester of an education degree. So they are teaching 3 classes, and still completing uni and still have to take time off to go do their uni pracs (not suppose to/aren't allowed to do it in the school you teach)
107. I've just read on there that to be approved for a PTT you must "meet all requirements of their accredited program to graduate from the program. Requirements include but are not limited to: - successful completion of the final PEx; and successful completion of a teaching performance assessment". How can this possibly be done after one semester at uni? Are you in a rural area or near the CBD?
108. near the cbd, that part of the requirement is basically saying the schools must ensure they give them time off and make sure they are making progress. As long as they are enrolled in teaching program they can get PTT qualifications(see quote from pst pdf). we currently have 6 at my school. 2 that are young first years, 3 more in their final year and 1 who is from the trades which is what ptt was suppose to be about. >• Employment of a PST under PTT is informed by an understanding of their knowledge and experience, capability and capacity and progression through an initial teacher education program. • Consideration is given to employment and study workloads that allow PSTs to be successful both in their work and their study. we used to have intern system, where schools could hire teachers once they finished the final prac but before they were offically registered. They changed alot of rules a few years back after covid to make ptt more accessible.
109. He is smashing the bongs. Let him get a couple more in before he responds again.
110. https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianTeachers/comments/1g5gzzd/are_queensland_schools_really_getting_that/ might be a good read for you.
111. My partner is a teacher. That is not what is happening
112. Council could start by reprogramming traffic lights to ensure that pedestrians don't get conflicting vehicle movements. In Brisbane (at least) they love giving pedestrians a green light at the same time as giving turning cars a green light to drive through the pedestrian crossing. We simply don't do this for other cars. Imagine simultaneously giving a green light to cars travelling in two conflicting directions! Any reasonable person would tell you that it's simply impossible for that to happen, it's so dangerous and nobody would ever be that dumb. But with pedestrians, it's cool. Give them a green light at the same time as a car is given a green light to blow through the crossing. That doesn't seem laughably impossible. In fact it happens at so many intersections that it seems mundane and normal. If we must have traffic lights, then the pedestrian movements should be given the same priority as vehicle movements. That is, when the pedestrian crossing has a green light, every car wanting to drive through the pedestrian crossing should have a red light. It's not rocket science.
113. Better yet, increase the time that the red arrow is actually lit up. It's useless if it's on for 5 seconds when it takes 15 to cross the entire intersection - people seem to forget that pedestrians are crossing both away \*and\* toward the traffic that's turning left.
114. I moved to Brisbane from Melbourne. I love Brisbane, but I've been stunned by how inhospitable it is to pedestrians and cyclists, and how few safe crossing areas there are, even near schools.
