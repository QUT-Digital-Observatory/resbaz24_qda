Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Hey I think you're missing the point. The help to buy scheme does good by allowing more people to purchase a home. You've argued that it's a slim demographic and that's true. Is helping some people not worth it when the alternative (what we have right now) is inaction? The people it helps will be in less debt than if they bought a house off the scheme so I'm not sure what you mean by they will be in deep debt. This scheme is only anticipated to increase house prices by $283 per home for every 100 000 homes. https://grattan.edu.au/news/why-help-to-buy-is-a-good-idea/#:~:text=Our%20modelling%20shows%20that%20for,price%20of%20a%20%24700%2C000%20home.
2. Yet if they'd championed for much cheaper public transport instead of free they might have had a chance of getting it up themselves. Perfect being the enemy of good
3. I’d love to see Max handed his marching orders at the next election. I’ve never seen a more objectionable smug arsehole in politics than him.
4. “What policies do you feel are pure fantasy“ Back in local elections it was then thinking they could buy eagle farm for $40m when the literal laws put the minimum at $2bn, but more likely at ~$5bn
5. He must be talking about the cheaper public transport - oh wait Labor basically adopted that one. Well maybe he means giving free lunches to school ki- wait hang on a second…
6. > The greens have made themselves irrelevant, protesting anything and everything so its actually impossible for the regular person to support them without feeling at conflict and excluded as well. Have an example of something they protest that puts you off?
7. I mean, it was a huge lib swing that they lost. People were worried about labor and not understanding how it works voted labor instead of greens.
8. So much cope
9. Agreed. Holding the Olympics and Gabba rebuild hostage for a tiny school is terrible politics.
10. Same, I think that’s a big reason why Amy Macmahon has lost her seat. There was a very small (but vocal) contingent who didn’t want to see the Gabba redeveloped and the school moved. For a lot of us in the area it was exciting to get a new stadium & for all the investment that would have come with being the centre of the olympics.
11. There is no downside to democracy. It’s just you don’t like other peoples opinions.
12. Call bullshit all you like mate, but even Friendly Jordies has pulled this before. He pulled it during the Qld last state election when he was focusing on the South Brisbane seat. And you know that guy knows how preferential voting works. I've been around Labor supporters a lot, and I am telling you this is a common tactic they implement.
13. As far as I know, no one is "in charge" of the Qld Greens, which just furthers my point about people like Sri turning people off the party completely, because they don't have a leader for the people to gravitate towards in terms of forming an overall opinion about the party. EDIT: I just looked and it now seems the greens will probably keep Maiwar, so maybe this is all BS anyway.
14. True
15. I voted one nation first, and the progressive party second. I put greens last, a close second last was the animal welfare party.
16. Their policies aren’t immature, they’re literally already in force in other locations or have a history of being used in Australia. Eg. Rent caps in force in ACT right now, and Commonwealth Bank was a public bank before it got privatised. Those policies aren’t anything new.
17. *We'll freeze rents for two years followed by a 1% cap on annual rent increases* - QLD Greens website Not a single mention of following CPI or anything else you imagined
18. It was a landslide really
19. Mate, it stinks of the inconvenient truth. Your being idealistic and not realistic. I have no experience as a surgeon but you know what, I have a RIGHT to tell surgeons how to do their job and if the people vote on me being a surgeon I'm gonna start cutting people open. A bit of maturity would go a long way here. The Greens haven't ever governed. They won't ever. And should stick to their knitting. They are a niche party that should campaign about the environment. They're effective doing that. With 0 experience governing they have 0 credibility to offer economic policies that sit in isolation of the wider economy. You may not like it but it's reality.
20. Your shit is reliant on what regional QLD farms produce.
21. They have something in writing, but they surely aren't talking about them.
22. Do you not consider Australia built on Medicare?
23. Look at Jono's reign of terror and what he accomplished (not much) I lived in his electorate and he was always saying "we're going to put a stop sign here" and other wild shit....magically it never happened. Reality is when they have 1-2 seats they have fuck all power to do anything
24. It looks like the Greens vote barely changed. It's more McMahon's fault more than anything.
25. They became not required when Labor took some of these ideas to a more reasonable level. That’s the point a lot of people are making in this post today.
26. If they were critical of all current wars, then you would be correct. Focusing on only this one makes you anti semitic
27. We’re not in America… although you did make me look up the history of abortion in Australia a bit (it’s a loaded topic; I don’t have all day). I didn’t know Western Australia didn’t completely decriminalise it until 2023. But I think “completely” is the determinant word in that phrase. There’s always a point in the pregnancy/abortion when if you wait too long the baby is just going to come out clearly alive and viable. But I’m not against abortion; I fully support it. It’s just like an extremely gynocentric topic that completely hogs the conversation and leaves no opening other ideas in the topic. That’s why the appeal of it is a trap/bait, it’s a conversation that needs a lot of explaining to convey well in a way that actually speaks to everybody. (Err this might’ve been the most divisive take I’ve taken on here yet; I’m not an antagonist to it. The Greens just went about it in a rather dumb way.)
28. We're talking about greens which are proposing things that will destroy the economy and the life and lifestyle of millions if left unchecked.
29. Is that not how democracy works..? Not so democratic when it’s just major parties deciding everything for everyone?
30. thats not how the balance of power works
31. > understand A lot of things must be woke then with the way that guy talks
32. I know you greens don't like it, but the reality.is that you hate progress. I live in the Gabba and the rubbish you carry on about progress in the south Brisbane electorate has its toll on residents. Anti Gabba redevelopment, anti development, anti aircraft noise, anti east Brisbane state school relocation, anti pineapple park redevelopment and on and on. Tonight the majority of constituents and long time residents including our 4 residents since the late 70's told you that the Olympics is coming and the area is changing whether you like it or not and being a Greenie and stalling progress is not acceptable and it's not what the residents want. We want a more modern and livable inner Brisbane.
33. Not necessarily, if they thought that there seat would be between green and labour and that labour may not get the seats needed to form a majority which they may still prefer over having a green member in their electorate with a minority government then they may switch to try to help labour get a majority. Preferential voting allows you to vote who you want and get second best at a per seat level but at a state level it can swing things still. If it was closer between labour and lnp and both were minority governments then it's understandable to want to cast your vote to one of the two rather than one of the smaller parties.
34. I know how preferential voting works but I considered giving Labor my first preference to help their primary vote at one point when they were really far behind in the polls. I didn't want to see a landslide as I also did really like this labor government. I ended up voting greens when I saw that minority government might have been on the cards.
35. Yup that's what I meant by the greens outright losing the faith of the electorate. After all, they held that seat before so some people went from preferring greens to preferring alp and lnp 1 and 2
36. But those people weren't voting green in the first place. They exist, for sure, but they're not relevant to the situation you're responding to. Anyone "who voted green before" and switched to labour to support Miles would still have put GRN second, unless the greens had genuinely lost them. That's the point.
37. Tree Tories
38. You mean this year? Right now it's sitting 58%ALP VS 43 greens
39. Fair call on Griffith, maybe Rudd will come back lol. Ryan is a traditionally LNP seat. Should return to them
40. Sure, but the reality needs to be considered here - what does it have to do with a state government election and how can a state MP impact this situation? If this was a federal election it's a different story, to an extent.
41. 70% of Palestinians support what happened on October 7th. Feel sorry for the other 30% though.
42. Nobody here cares though
43. Yes supporting terrorists is the clear winner here
44. If the Palestinians put down all their weapons tonight the Palestinians would still exist in the morning, if the Israelis put down their weapons tonight they would all be dead by the morning! “To the river to the sea” who is really supporting genocide
45. Yup. But it's not a state issue. This is where the greens fuck up IMO. They focus too much on big issue social stuff at the lower levels. People can't afford food, they don't have the energy to care about Gaza
46. But take a second and ponder, how would a Greens MP have ANY influence over the issue in Israel / Palestine. Politicians must balance priorities with things they're actually capable of changing / implementing.
47. Bro we got our own issues 😂😭
48. https://www.wagepeaceau.org/ferra-engineering-boeing-queensland-government-investments-in-the-weapons-industry/ Btw here you go. Weapons manufacturers opperating in Queensland supplying Israel are funded at a state level. This didn't have to be true for my point to stand, but it is.
49. I don't make a distinction between different levels of Labor governments. Sorry! I know that reddit radlibs are really insistent that I should stop caring what a political organization does at other levels of government and just vote for roads or some shit, but I legitimately do not care. I ain't voting for that doo-doo ass party for any position from dog-catcher to prime Minister, you fund genocide at the level of government that actually matters, your whole party is tainted.
50. OK buddy, keep telling yourself the \*very real\* people in this war machine of a system that is capitalism who find themselves emotional about \*genocide\* and imperialism are bots or foreign agents or whatever. Hope it makes you feel really comfortable. I recognize that I am posting in a community that is somewhat of a bubble (because honestly what isn't) and one that is generally pretty opposed to my core beliefs but I would never act like the opinions that are mainstream in here do not reflect some portion of the community. I think the perspective is a mix of self-interest since middle class life in the west is to some extent propped up by imperialism (although who knows how much is real vs perceived), "new-atheist" style islamophobia that is pretty prevalent in US style liberals - even if they refuse to admit it and just a flat-out refusal I see in most corners of Australian life to understand how connected we are to the rest of the world. But I'd never delude myself into thinking the attitudes in this forum are not common across Brisbane. Why am I so inflammatory? Because I do not care about convincing any of you. You aren't my friends and I'm not trying to convince you to do anything. I am also very, very tired of Redditor debate pedantry. So yes, I'm going to say how I really feel and I won't be polite about it (even if that first comment really was pretty tame by my standards).
51. You should run. You’ll get media training. Apparently there’s an LNP MP somewhere who has published erotica under his own name? Your skeletons can’t be that bad…
52. As a fellow queer commie, I think more of us running would be rad as Hell, actually.
53. Dang
54. I have never heard any Green politicians talking about intersectionality or mircoaggressions. Are you referencing a particular Greens policy or politician?
55. Pre-poll and postal votes aren't counted on polling day.
56. Agree, and the Greens are focusing on problems that they choose to put at the top of the list of priorities rather than listening to the people. After all, governments are meant to represent the people, not dictate what they think is best. When people are struggling to put food on the table or pay their rent the Greens issues are not going to be a priority for the average person just wanting some day to day relief and to feel safe and listened to.
57. > They want better management of these issues. Then they voted for the single worst group to actually manage it well, it's like having a sore on your toe so deciding to cut your foot off as some form of "triage". > They want policies that actually reduce the likelihood of needing cost of living support, not a bandaid fix. The LNP literally have -nothing- that would even begin doing this.
58. I was specifically talking about the speech he gave last night where he said the federal Greens didn't affect the Qld election. Literally every Greens voter I know switched to ALP over the federal Greens block-everything behaviour (they just constantly vote with the Liberal Party).
59. I audibly scoffed. Maiwar and Cooper has Greens on every billboard and telephone box and they brought in huge amounts of volunteers. I also have a small library of pamphlets and letters on my desk.
60. > Is helping some people not worth it when the alternative (what we have right now) is inaction? The trouble is it's helping like 0.02% of people, while actively making it worse for everyone else, so it's ultimately a net negative that fucks everyone even harder. > The people it helps will be in less debt than if they bought a house off the scheme so I'm not sure what you mean by they will be in deep debt. This presupposed that those people could already buy a house in the current system, that's straight false and the entire bias of the scheme. Let's also not act like people not having full equity in their homes isn't a completely fucked position to be in. > This scheme is only anticipated to increase house prices by $283 per home for every 100 000 homes. Their report shows literally 0 proof or reasoning for how they arrived at that number, just that they "estimate" it.
61. > > > Perfect being the enemy of good In this case, how is it? How is is there any large material difference between what the Greens were suggesting and what Labor ended up copying and implementing?
62. Have any links to that?
63. Hey now, can't forget Labor also stole and watered down the GP clinic idea.
64. All the Palestine rallies for one.
65. Yes. Their support of Hezbollah, a recognised terrorist group. Sometimes the underdogs are also the bad guys.
66. Against building more housing in the inner city for starters.
67. [deleted]
68. So yes, but also a wasted (and disturbing) vote
69. You do realise that if CPI fell to below 1%, the ACT’s rent cap would mean a *lower* increase than the QLD Greens fixed/predictable 1% proposal… right? So again - why are rent caps “batshit insane” and “not realistic” when the exact scenario, and even lower rent increases, can and does happen in another part of Australia where it is already law? The fact it can already occur under the ACT’s rent cap shows it is not unrealistic.
70. No it wasn’t close to a landslide. Was a net 3% gain. Labor has 30 seats. Campbell Newman left Labor with 7 seats. That’s a landslide mate. 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
71. People have no qualifications in anything but in a democracy everybody gets a vote and voice. Their economic policies are sound policies, just unpopular culturally because the average voter is stupid and doesn't understand economics and still cling to the idea they're temporarily frustrated millionaires when the growing class wealth divide driven by the shadow of neoliberalism is a pyramid scheme bursting apart.
72. 100% wrong. This is the line the big two parties throw around to keep themselves in power. You know who actually runs the country? Civil servants: people who got their jobs by virtue of actually having the relevant skills, as opposed to a bunch of suits who won a popularity contest. Ask anyone who's worked in government and you'll hear story after story of good policy drafted by civil servants being quashed or rewritten into something unrecognisable by politicians because it went against party ideology or the request of some lobby group that funded the winner's last election.
73. Once billionaires get done with buying most of the farm land like they are in the US at least we won’t have to hear these regional farmers whinge.
74. Weird, because it was a central talking point of my local candidate, who was the member for your area and what did they talk about then?
75. Healthcare is a public service, no different to public transport or libraries, not exactly the back bone of socialism
76. The party of hot air
77. Yeah agree. In her seat she couldn’t move the needle which is exactly what is needed to win the seat.
78. That’s ridiculous. Firstly, as a party they have been very anti war, this isn’t new for them. Secondly, even if they hadn’t, it’s a straw man argument, just because someone hasn’t criticised a war doesn’t mean they can’t speak out about 40,000+ people dying. Governments shouldn’t be immune to criticism and no one should be ok with innocent people dying regardless of their religion, skin colour, etc.
79. >If they were critical of all current wars we are? wtf lmao
80. That’s total nonsense.
81. I didn't think you were antagonistic to it. My point is that it doesn't just impact women and legalisation isn't everything. And I don't think it was the main reason (not even close) as to why the Greens tanked. If anything they were aligning themselves with the same sentiment that helped oust the coalition at the federal level. More likely, it came down to changed Labour/Liberal preferences and what the greens have been doing at the federal level. I'm confused about the downvotes. Care to elaborate, nameless downvoters?
82. Ya know we don't lock up people for life for most crimes yeah?
83. Democracy is rule by the majority. Also, preferential voting ensures that a true majority is established. A vote for the Greens is a vote for Labor in reality. But when the Greens win 1 seat in a hung parliament, it's anti democratic because the 10000 people in that electorate who voted for the Greens have power over policy for let's say, 27 million people. That is what the Greens are: Anti democratic because they aim for the balance of power. Why should a party with 9.8% of the vote in QLD have any say on policy? Tonight's result of 0 Green seats is democratically fair. It will happen in the federal election as well.
84. It absolutely is. Saying it's not is ignorant on how power work.
85. Agree. Former greens voter in South Brisbane, now vote for ALP. Definitely don’t feel like Amy represented the area well. When I wrote to her saying I as a constituent would support the Gabba rebuild & relocation of the school I received condescending replies from staffers. Stopping the relocation of the school seems to be her only priority for the area and it impacted such a small amount of people (and the disingenuous “don’t close out school” slogans were ridiculous given a brand new school was to be opened). They are against high density redevelopment in the cross river rail site (if not there, where??) I don’t feel like she achieved anything in 4 years. There was no vision I was aware of. In comparison Jackie Trad worked to get a new high school (BSSSC) for the area, was instrumental in getting the abortion bill for Queensland women, cross river rail etc.
86. That is some ass backwards logic. If you're voting for The Greens you obviously don't want a majority Labor government dude.
87. What do you mean by help their primary vote? What difference does that make?🤷🏼‍♂️
88. Yes, I know, but that assumes that the LNP don’t overtake Labor to enter the top two. It’s explained in more detail on the ABC results page.
89. > maybe Rudd will come back lol I want to subscribe to this timeline...
90. Political parties can care about more than one or a few things through. I saw much more shared about the other big issues they want to tackle. It wasn’t there main policy/argument. Just one of many.
91. Um, ok, the question was asked, why? So I guess some people care. If you don’t, just scroll on.
92. I hardly think so, they have decimated Gaza and have moved onto Lebanon.
93. If either side put down all their weapons they would die, it’s not a black and white conflict
94. Even without putting their weapons down, Israel has stolen/taken most of what was part of Palestine. Palestine is now just two little territories walled off almost like an open air prison. So what do you think would happen if they put their weapons down? There would be nothing left of Palestine.
95. > Yup. But it's not a state issue. I mean it absolutely is if you care about all your constituents. > This is where the greens fuck up IMO. They focus too much on big issue social stuff at the lower levels. Can you show a single Greens candidate who made this their primary platform position, and not just one of many things that they talked about? > People can't afford food, they don't have the energy to care about Gaza Damn, if only literally every Greens candidate -did- have this as their primary talking point, along with a set of policies to actively address the issue as opposed to the LNP who have..?
96. > how would a Greens MP have ANY influence over the issue in Israel / Palestine. I mean you don't have to ponder, they've directly stated it on their website and via their policies? There's absolutely things we could be doing.
97. and here's exhibit A.
98. No I'm using my big theory words to describe the interactions where someone correctly identifies micro aggressions and moments of intersectional bigotry and chooses to push back on them. That's not my focus when I'm doing politicking but has been my experience watching Green politicking at more grassroots levels. I'm happy to talk about them, I just don't find it useful to push back on someone calling me ma'am or miss unless it's an environment where they are devaluing my education. Using normative forms of address or even the wrong one (I do get male ones sometimes) is less on my agenda than talking about environment and listening, or youth crime, or whatever.
99. Pre-polls and postals are already counted in Maiwar (a small number still to come). Not sure what the ABC computer is doing but other projections reckon the Greens hold on.
100. > When people are struggling to put food on the table or pay their rent the Greens issues are not going to be a priority for the average person just wanting some day to day relief and to feel safe and listened to. Uhh, so you just have 0 idea on the Greens positions or policies then? Because this is literally a key part of their platform.
101. So when we were talking to voters in Maiwar we would pivot the conversations about the cost of rent, if it can up as a concern, to how the greens were blocking this bill. We would explain that the first home owners grant helps that one family but increases housing prices for everyone else and is tailored to new homes being built on the urban fringe not helping people buy in their local area, amongst their community. People are angry at the expectation that to be able to afford a home they should have to move out of the city they grew up in. Most of these renter wants to be a home owner, having a realistic path of getting there. It was pretty effective showing people that their local member was working to stop them being able to have a home.
102. You still need to gather numbers for how many and where people are using the system so you can allocate resources effectively. Having a minimal payment means you use the existing infrastructure instead of spending extra to retrofit the network with cameras or sensors to do the same job.
103. Because anything you don't pay for gets treated (by a small but still meaningful minority) like shit. Of all the people who behave like scum on the bus, how many pay for their fare? ZERO.
104. https://amp.abc.net.au/article/103549030
105. Why did these rallies annoy you?
