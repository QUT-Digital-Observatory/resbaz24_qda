Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Has anyone said coal royalties will be cut?
2. Entire western world really. Cost of living and housing scarcity impact every western nation in a similar way, as if there is some common cause that affects them al. Mu5t B3 qLd LaboUR!
3. This is federal but does affect us all but, one would be the fact that Albo tripled the number of migrants entering the country greatly exacerbating the housing crisis.
4. Free from new ways to tax them? So not free from the old taxes?
5. The beauty of a preferential voting system is that I don't have to vote either LNP or Labor, I can vote for who I want, and then decesendinly preference my least favourite parties starting with, for example, socialist alliances type psychos, greens, and Labor. That the LNP appear above Labor is just a symptom of my dislike of them being slightly less than absolute loathing of the Labor thugs. And you are the one being disingenuous regarding abortion. You know, or should know if you are this invested, that under the previous laws such cases as you mention would be allowed anyway, and in fact allowing such procedures is in line with even the *Catholic Church's* laws on abortion.
6. Like imagine 2 parties coming up with competing ideas about how to best serve the public, rather then one party that is 50/50 and one that's sole purpose is to line their pockets.
7. Yeah, but Japan isn't a perfect country to point to, their treatment of elderly and disabled people is almost criminal, plus they have zero to no immigration. My idea wasn't we should let liberal in, my point is there should be 2 parties for the people with differing strategies. What's the point of democracy when only one party is above the compentcy mark.
8. That is the long term solution, yes, but something needs to change in the immediate to prevent it as well. Like you mentioned earlier, some kids are picking up trade certs off the back of committing crime. Commit a crime and get a trade. What a deal! What an incentive. It makes no sense. They’re teens, they do deserve a chance to fix their life but they don’t get the right to ruin someone else’s to do that, and they shouldn’t have any incentive that points to that path. That has to change. Whether it’s stricter juvi conditions or something else, something needs to change for immediate. Not long term, immediate. Long term is a hard issue to solve and it’s not right for victims to keep suffering along the way. I don’t understand how we are in a time where people are advocating for the criminal over the victims safety.
9. >It should work like that except youth don't think they'll be caught Thats not true. They 100% know they will get caught and nothing will happen except some free food for a week. You clearly havent heard them joke and laugh as they decide who earned the most "points" for stealing the most expensive car or ramming the most cop cars when they get their post crime spree hospital checkups.
10. Of course, had nothing to do with him being exposed as being a narcissistic wanker of the highest order.
11. How about you look into who actually sold qld assets instead of regurgitating this verbal diarrhoea.
12. No need to pay it back though once things picked up hey (ALP and LNP I am talking about). Neckminuit there is another crisis so more debt to stack on top of all the other debt. When do we start paying it back?
13. You mean when Howard was in power and paid ALL debt back and handed Kevin 07 a $30b bank balance to squander? Maybe the Howard/Costello government did indeed cash in on what ever you are talking about.... If it is about the mining boom from 2004-2008, then any royalties here would have gone to state governments. No need to tell me what I am concerned for with my family. I have that covered champ.
14. NDIS scaling up and then COVID?
15. No not at all but neither has the fact that all these so called stimulus packages has been spent unwisely. Also noticed is that successive governments have made no attempt to pay back borrowings so we can be in a strong position next time there is a disaster.
16. Thanks Wayne Swann, but if it worked the economy would't be f\*\*\*ed post COVID.
17. What do you mean once. Murdoch also supported Whitlam getting elected.
18. She was outside the building killing people in her holden commodore.
19. Was there anything he did that *wouldn't* be a reason?
20. Middle eastern wars Work choices GST General conservative policies that harm the working class Sending thugs to break up strikes
21. Then don't insinuate that people are just being angry for the sake of being angry.
22. Then why the "or are you just an angry reditor looking to be angry?"
23. Since Javier took over he has basically fixed the country problems by getting rid of such unnecessary taxes which increased prosperity for the citizens/small businesses, corporations to thrive, prosperous is the future of his government/country that finally got surpluses in such long long time. `You’re pretty obviously going to argue bad faith shite, so have a good one I’ve got better things to do.` Don't get embarrassed since your weak gotcha argument couldn't stand up, and got proven wrong lol, but you're right I got better things to do than argue with someone who probably doesn't even know where Argentina is on the map or the problems it faced - you have good night.
24. Isn’t that the point? Argentina is not prosperous because they had high taxes on everything?
25. Landlords can only increase according to market value of the area by 10%, fix would be to increase supply/demand through cutting most of the unnecessary redtape set up in the housing development that has caused the slow-downs/cost increase in construction of new housing, make building housing very profitable, the competition would bring down pricing and create a vacuum of supply bringing down the market value which would kick the increase of rents down quite bit .Along with banning foreign ownership of housing/land for at least 2-4 years and bringing in a sensible immigration limit (some of this already being done, thankfully), tho I'm putting this pretty simply, how it would be implemented without it upsetting the market would be another thing.
26. Yes the lnp has stated it will be cut yet the measure will stay in place. But how can the measures be paid for if royalties are cut?
27. Legit. And we all know the real cause is that this is literally by design: welcome to late stage capitalism.
28. Even if he did just mean "no increase in mining taxes" (spoiler: he didn't) rather than, "no increase and I'm going to cut some of the existing ones", if LNP forms government that's a totally redundant thing to say. If you're in power and have no intention of making changes to a certain area of policy *you don't even mention it*. Which means he either plans to decrease mining taxes or at the very least do what the Newman government did and freeze the rates for a decade so that the next Labor government doesn't have the funds to actually implement measures that would make our lives better.
29. The strongest first world countries have socialist programmes, we have tangible proof that a country as a whole would thrive with them. Voting LNP does not stop the amount of money from tax it just dictates it goes to private businesses instead of the benefitting everyone. I have been to countries that prioritize profits of businesses over the welfare of it's people and it is not a place you would want to live. The only people (you included) voting LNP seem to not be able to give any good reason to do so. Less than 1% of abortions happen in late-term pregnancies and I am giving you a personal example of my real life friend almost dying from sepsis waiting for a board to get back to her about a necessary termination. It is currently happening in the USA. You need to stop bending over backwards to try and skew your view to an acceptable one, it's extremely disingenuous. I truly don't think you're a good person if you don't want to raise our standard of living and better our country. I am done with this conversation if you cannot give one single reason why we shouldn't benefit our state over giving tax breaks to corporations.
30. Well from experience working in polling, i would say that the biggest reason we get 2 candidates in PR voting systems is either elderly/apathetic/scared people who don't care or want huge majorities and just tick a box and pick the "nothing change box because i am too old/scared/lazy". The other is the barrier of funding for a campaign with media attention look at the something like the legalize cannabis party, it might be the most successful party in Australia because it has a budget of like 10k and has the 2/3rds the representation of one nation across the country who has a budget of like 50 million.
31. It sounds like you just want to hurt kids to satisfy your vengeance
32. I can also make things up
33. They also passed on a structural deficit, honestly that kind of bookkeeping would be illegal for anyone else.
34. >You mean when Howard was in power and paid ALL debt back By selling off our assets and practically giving away our resources. If I sold nearly everything I had, my bank account would look great too. But I'd have nothing but money.
35. Howard sold our public assets genius. That's where he got the money from.
36. No, not what you think caused the increase, which is dubious at best. What was the actual increase in debt while the LNP was in power from 2013 to 2022?
37. Wow it's almost as if the issues during and post COVID are different from the GFC!
38. cool tanget...still not located within my first comment ahahaha. And yet you continue to ignore the consistent history of murdoch paperrs endorsing the LNP repeatedly only to bring up sporadic and anomalous examples.
39. You mean the meth head guy on the bike who ran a red, yeah public service
40. What’s wrong with the GST?
41. He's a contrarian fool, don't bother
42. I didn't insinuate, I directly said it.
43. Wow, mighty condescending for someone who writes like a teenager. (Worse actually) Second, what you’re doing is obvious (and frankly stupid) cherry picking, that doesn’t actually contend with my so called “gotcha” Finally, you’ve provided no numbers or evidence to back your claim. In summation, you’re full of shit.
44. American, Australia, Britain, France and so on, nations which have experienced sustained periods of prosperity have done so at least in part through the application of government spending, which is drawn from taxes. Argentina is an absolutely shitty example, it has endured multiple periods of severe unrest including full blown juntas running the country. If you look at The Argentine Republic and believe it’s woes are the result of *taxes being to high* and nothing more, then I have a bridge to sell you.
45. aren't the owners themselves oppose new development projects that build high-rises all over the country? immigration is a valid point however, there should be a temporary freeze on new migrants, until housing can catch up.
46. Shhhh, if you say it outright the LNP and Labor supporters will unite
47. >I truly don't think you're a good person if you don't want to raise our standard of living and better our country. Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
48. What? Bait comment I’m sure but I’ve literally said I don’t want abuse, I want rehabilitation etc but that there needs to be an actual, working, deterrent to crime. Please don’t be ridiculous, and read things in full. Thank you. No need for that sortve commenting
49. Bruh, there's a reason why his popularity was below 30% and Gillard knifed him and no one backed him in the leadership vote. [PM reduces flight attendant to tears (smh.com.au)](https://www.smh.com.au/national/pm-reduces-flight-attendant-to-tears-20141112-9lb4.html) [Column on Kevin: may contain coarse language - ABC News](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-06-15/column-on-kevin-may-contain-coarse-language/866842) [Rudd rage captured in social media clip | The Canberra Times | Canberra, ACT](https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6176923/rudd-rage-captured-in-social-media-clip/) [Labor's shadow men stuck knife into Rudd - ABC News](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-06-25/labors-shadow-men-stuck-knife-into-rudd/880078) [Julia Gillard reveals – why I knifed Kevin Rudd | Daily Telegraph](https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/julia-gillard-reveals--why-i-knifed-kevin-rudd/news-story/07b427ac5f8ad612956ddd10b4bad446)
50. What resources did they give away?
51. States get royalties from resources. So how did the successive governments from 2007 manage to squander the money in the bank AND, to this day make no attempt to pay down the debt we have accrued. No comment here? When will we start paying back debt? Or is the Australian people now so addicted to "free stuff and handouts" that if ever a government reduces spending in an attempt to pay down debt, would that see them voted out of office? If the majority of characters on reddit is anything to go by, then debt will never be paid down (can't give up the handouts hey), but thankfully reddit is not an accurate representation of the populace.
52. Hawke and Keating sold Commonwealth Bank and Qantas. Howard sold Telstra but used the proceeds and the government’s surpluses to create a sovereign wealth fund which is now worth over $200 billion.
53. She was on the phone (by her own admission), distracted (by her own admission) and could not tell the police if she had a green light (fact). She got off on a technicality of being unable to establish the lights and the bike rider's speed. There means there was also no solid evidence he ran a red.
54. Hurts the working class more than the rich, they can afford a tax on regular goods no problem while their income taxes remain low
55. Makes it seem like your "interest" wasn't genuine then, just an opportunity to take a pot shot.
56. We’re not talking just about government spending. We’re talking about ‘taxing your way to prosperity’.
57. Getting them a job is rehabilitation tho
58. Julia Gillard was a fuckwit. He dressed down flight attendant doing a shit job. This happens every day in workplaces. Best PM ever since Keating.
59. Congratulations, this is the dumbest and most idiotic comment i have ever read. Not sure how you make PM, then head several international forums then become aus US ambassador on the construed basis of “being a narcissistic wanker” Clown 🤡
60. You live in Townsville yes? So do I, people on bikes are fucking insane man I just find it far more believable the bike was at fault, yes maybe if she wasn’t chatting or didn’t enter on an amber she couldn’t avoided him, but avoided him breaking the law…
61. Income taxes are higher than the GST. Rich people buy more/higher-priced goods and services, so they pay more GST tax. Working class spend a greater share of their consumption on essentials (basic food, education, healthcare, childcare), which are tax free.
62. They’re inextricably linked. Not understanding that is the root of the libertarians=housecats joke.
63. By way of committing a crime? That’s the entry to a job? Nope. It sounds like you just want crime to have no deterrence or response and only reward?
64. There is some truth to this, I agree. I generally feel the Townsville roads are not traffic friendly. Townsville roads are dangerous for people on motorbikes, bicycles and pedestrians. Car flow is shit too, people cannot merge, the town is full of fucking asshats who speed up to block people in merge lanes, tail gating and speeding.
65. Its a flat rate tax, its regressive and it hurts the poor more...Im convinced your a bot https://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary\_business/committees/senate/community\_affairs/completed\_inquiries/1999-02/gst/reports/c02#:\~:text=It%20is%20a%20flat%20rate,as%20a%20household%20earning%20%2410%2C000.
66. So you don't want rehabilitation you want punishment
67. It’s not flat, it’s zero on many essentials that poorer households spend a greater share of their incomes on.
68. I want deterrence that works.
69. My cited source parliamentary inquiry outdoes whatever the fuck you wanna continue making up
70. Well juvi was never really a deterrence to begin with. If the threat of prison was an actual deterrent to crime people wouldn't commit them.
71. The page you linked to is from before the GST was introduced, when the GST still was going to be a flat tax on everything. The government then changed this, so that it wouldn’t be a flat rate on everything, with many essentials exempt from the tax.
72. So many people don’t because of that deterrent also, but at least there is actual consequence for adult crime. I’m not even saying it has to be juvi, just something needs to improve. If people know there is no real backlash to them committing the crime, infact in some ways a reward, they’ll just keep doing it more and more and won’t care. It’s exactly what you see today. We both agree on wanting the kid to fix their life. I just want it to stop happening as soon as possible and that won’t be by longterm solutions. Maybe the parents need to have some involvement in the outcome of their actions, something to incentivise more active parenting because they can also get looped in if their kid plays up too often. Idk, spitballing here now. It’s not working though, plastic. It’s not fair to victims and it’s a shame for the teen to have such a rough life, but the answer isn’t committing crimes to try to improve your life. The help needs to have an impact before that and poor decisions need to have a response. Wish you the best.
73. 🤡
74. Would you prefer public floggings then?
75. [https://www.acma.gov.au/election-and-referendum-blackout-periods#current-blackout-periods](https://www.acma.gov.au/election-and-referendum-blackout-periods#current-blackout-periods) It only applies to TV and radio. Not digital services. Something that should probably be changed now though.
76. Meanwhile Crisafulli announced costings for his policy will come out today. Waiting until the media blackout of course. EDIT: Update: Costings came through this afternoon. His key policies are achieved by a $6.8 billion cut to public consultants and will be offering, "competitive," pay packages similar to private consultants. No costings offered for his plan to make small hydro plants everywhere. In other words, he's cutting public servant wages to push for private sector consultants on projects and cutting government jobs to pay for his crime crackdowns and doesn't know what his policies will cost anyway for small hydro. Campbell Newman 2.0 confirmed.
77. The blackout period only applies to broadcasters. Online services (including streamed content viewed on smart TVs) and print media can still publish election or referendum ads during a blackout period. https://www.acma.gov.au/election-and-referendum-blackout-periods
78. anyone have a link to David's Crisafooli's costings?
79. These dumb ads for youth crime seems to be all they have. Serious issue of course but dumb and over hyped.
80. It is almost as if the LNP cookers are crooks.
81. I got a text from LNP this morning 🤢
82. hahah Jason Hunt is labor. !
83. It's ok. The Astroturfers will keep us entertained.
84. Jason *unt!
85. They are obeying the law 😂 read the legislation properly before posting misinformation.
86. Yawn, you'll survive.
87. Lol you're the one who doesn't know the laws not them.
88. Do you think Labor is any better there politicians anything they say should be taken with a bucket of salt
89. Should be enough for a reason not to vote for him. He’s had eight years to be able to get all of these ducks in a row ready to show us come the election…. He didn’t and has hidden it until the last minute when there will be zero coverage, that should to tell you everything you need to know.
90. I was wondering what is even the point of releasing costings during a blackout but realised it’s so Crisafulli can claim a mandate to implement them.
91. I don't see how publicising the costings isn't in violation of the blackout
92. Where can it be found?
93. are you serious? He’s released costings after voting started?
94. Anyone found the paper crisafuckwhit was meant to release on costings today?
95. Not sure if *he* does.
96. 1. Buy coal at extravagant prices from financial backers. 2. Pocket a %. 3. Gifted career as CEO after 4 or 8 years. There you go, LNP policy.
97. And incarceration is supposed to be the last resort, not the first.
98. My condolences If the lnp win Im fucking off to Melbourne as fast as I can
99. Yeah, the poor little bastards don’t like it when things don’t go there way…
100. Yes. They are better. One leader has honour. The other stole 300k last time they were in office. The difference is very visible
101. Are you saying politicians that obfuscate (see lnp costings release) are equal to or better than those that don’t?
102. That's not enough reason to not vote for him, because I decided to vote Libs decades ago when Daddy told me to, and I haven't questioned it since. That doesn't tell me what I need to know, because I know that "Liberals are better with the economy" and any facts to the contrary are uneducated hippies. The world is changing, and I'm scared. /S
103. So that the majority of the older voter base who aren't on social media constantly are completely unaware of how unrealistic his goals are financially. These are the people LNP is appealing to this election.
104. It’s publicised digitally, hidden in a tiny shit url. Digital services aren’t covered by the blackout. But basically no one will see it without really having a proper look which he’s hoping people can’t
105. It is because proposed policy costings is a key part of campaign material.
106. It hasn't been released yet. Cristafulli did say a week ago it was going to be released today though. Still waiting. https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/politics/qld-treasurer-cameron-dick-questions-david-janetzkis-whereabouts-as-lnp-yet-to-clarify-economic-costings-for-state-election/news-story/993e3e2313bbc8137936b70e16d8c203

In other words, he's cutting public servant wages and jobs to pay for his crime crackdowns and doesn't know what his policies will cost anyway. Campbell Newman 2.0 confirmed.
108. He actually hasn't even released them yet; they're supposedly according to Cristafulli a week ago to get released today but no update.

110. hahaha touche sir
111. hahaha thanks for the laff and bittered sigh that this is reality
112. Thays your opinion and you are entitled to it but my point is that absolute power corrupts absolutely and as such should be treated with caution
113. Not at all what i an saying is that everyone should be doing there research to make the best decision with as much information as possible not that one side is right and the other is wrong and that as far as the politicians are concerned they should be held to a higher standard after all they are tasked with the country's well-being
114. I always put the Lying Nasty Party last.
115. What absolute crap, people can’t stand Stevie, and his crap.. that’s why they are getting voted out
116. Sorry that is a fact? He literally stole money. That’s not really an opinion
117. Thats not an option, he factually stole Australian taxpayer money, the other option made abortion legal.
118. That's literally what happened, not *opinion*. You're entitled to live in your own parallel universe you dullard, just don't bring the rest of us down into it.
119. Do you... do you think that the premier of Queensland has "absolute power"? If you're saying we should extend that to "limited power corrupts limitedly", then... I guess? I mean, it certainly has the potential to. It just feels like the average LNP politician becomes corrupt *then* seeks office.
120. You can't do your own research if somebody obfuscates facts to prevent access to information. Crisafulli is not transparent ie hiding grants pushed for political donors, refusing to release policy costings until after media blackouts and refusing to publicly confirm if he'll allow a conscience vote on Katter's abortion proposals or not. How the fuck are you meant to do research when somebody refuses to share facts for you to compare and scrutinise? But hey, you know what the Liberals say? If you don't know, vote no.
121. >everyone should be doing there research to make the best decision with as much information as possible Agreed. So let's extend that to the party that is refusing to release costings & share information important to the electorate making this decision. By your own standard they cannot be trusted.
122. I do the same to the Arse Licking Pricks
123. A lot of us love Steven. He's doing an amazing job progressing QLD forward.
124. Is there any solid evidence of the crime, and maybe you should look up the abortion laws it might just shock you
125. I honestly don't trust any politician as far as i can kick them
126. Nope…
127. [https://www.reddit.com/r/ipswich/comments/1g684ly/crisafullis\_300000\_favour\_for\_a\_donor\_hidden\_by/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ipswich/comments/1g684ly/crisafullis_300000_favour_for_a_donor_hidden_by/) There you go captain, since google is too hard for you.
128. >the abortion laws it might just shock you Enlighten us.
129. Yes, but the ones hiding/withholding important information from the electorate the week of an election are clearly the least trust worthy.
130. God it's like trying to talk to Trumpers.
131. Yeah, your argument was compelling, at least from today we don’t have to listen to you whining Labor faithful’s
132. Because a 'nope' is the epitome of compelling arguments. Conservatives out here being as insufferable as always.
133. The meth is strong 💪 b you Luke
134. Bye bye Steve… brilliant news for Qld
135. Wow.... Really? Embarrassing behaviour, bro.
136. 😩👊
