Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Brother, the only thing Crisafulli said with pure conviction as a campaign promise was that he would end the government interference with mining profits. Everything else was muddled words. If the only thing he plans on doing is getting rid of the state‚Äôs largest revenue source, htf do you think they‚Äôre going to keep 50c fares? Either they will cut them or run us into debt, neither are good.
2. Yep I see them mate but Its too hard to make out the numbers with all the horrible things I see from LNP
3. There's a marked difference between a random string of numbers and a pattern of behaviour, you're just being asinine.
4. Oh okay thanks for the explanation and info. Yeah my Mrs worked in government the last time this happened and I remember the hiring freeze and the freeze on wage increases for years (then they ended up back paying them anyways) and all the firings and rehirings as more expensive contractors.... Problem is I've been applying in the public sector like mad lately and I just want to get in and get through that probationary period out of the way at least.
5. You already get mining royalties in your $100 which are linked to market prices for coal.
6. Ha - shit, they‚Äôre on to me lads!
7. All of those were in 2010. I checked. Anna Bligh sold a lot of assets to private interests. It was a deeply unpopular decision even among Labor members and voters. The sales were announced just after winning the 2009 election, because she knew she couldn't propose them beforehand.
8. And LNP didn't learn since being in power last?
9. The swamp needs to be drained, ALP lost because it spent too much time keeping SEQ constituents content while the rest of the state languished. Palla-shay should have at least had the gumption to stick around and take the loss with good humour.
10. holy shit that makes so much more sense!
11. No they didn‚Äôt. Crisafulli said on Friday he‚Äôs pro choice and they‚Äôve said a million times they won‚Äôt touch abortion. It‚Äôs baffling how many people play bird box with the topic even when it‚Äôs been debunked.
12. They are not coping at all. I don‚Äôt understand why the catastrophising. We all get up and go to work, pay taxes until we die. It‚Äôs really not the end of the world the Government will always change sometimes. They are really bad losers.
13. So you cherry pick what you believe and don‚Äôt believe. Sounds about right.
14. Coconut just hates having valid points thrown their way
15. yeesh, good luck. They might be looking to churn through existing public workers though. Just incidentally fire people who are kicking up a stink about workplace conditions, anyone union affiliated, etc. So you may be hired as a person to replace people they fire for some reason or another. I mean who knows. Newman literally ousted the corruption commission last time. [https://independentaustralia.net/politics/politics-display/newman-government-kills-queenslands-corruption-watchdog,6473](https://independentaustralia.net/politics/politics-display/newman-government-kills-queenslands-corruption-watchdog,6473) I don't think Crisafulli ever promised to be above board.
16. LNP plans to reduce them. More like $75. Mining companies already paid their dues with the LNP advertising they bought, can't expect them to also pay their full royalties. We'll get back to 100 by cutting important public services! Yay! /s
17. Thanks. I mean Victoria is currently selling their road network or something right now. Labor isn't perfect on this, far from it. But budgets do exist as well... Government is rough.
18. Certainly not about sacking public servants? They're still ok with that. Crisafulli was interviewed and said as such, that the sackings were fine, but next time they'll do them slower. That said, they have made many election commitments, several of which were not costed despite constant reassurances to the contrary, but none of those were to not sell public assets. So... I believe they will sell public assets. Maybe they'll just 99-year lease them.
19. So you don‚Äôt like any of those public servants? They‚Äôre from the swamp? Hope your house doesn‚Äôt catch on fire.
20. Wannabe Americans are so weird
21. Leach to society.
22. Bet you voted for albo so the kids could have free meals and get a free 150$ off your power bill. ü§°
23. But then Freya Ostapovich, straight after he said that, was recorded saying that they'll ban it all. So who's lying already?
24. Has it been though? Just wait until the wedge from Katter Jr, oh here's my Private Member's Bill, do you dare not allow a conscious vote?? Then the Liberal religious right MPs look at Christ-he-full-of-it, then look at their voter base, and........Then the Premier shrugs his shoulders, says it was NOT part of his plan as at 25 October 2024, and he can't be like the ALP and force his MPs to vote a certain way because that's not LNP rules. Sorry, it well, it wasn't part of my plan......honest and truly, it wasn't.
25. It‚Äôs not Austerity, it‚Äôs Ozterity.
26. Go look at the royalty tables - the money they‚Äôre paying today is the same as it was before Labor added the new tiers‚Ä¶the higher tiers kicked in only when coal went to once in a lifetime prices.
27. Cope and Seethe harder, commie
28. Yes, you are. Good of you to realise it though.
29. one nations leader is a known racist
30. She didn‚Äôt even win her seat so you can chill champ
31. Katter can introduce what they want (even they are backing down on it) because they won‚Äôt have any majority to pass it. LNP have said they won‚Äôt touch abortion laws.
32. LNP still wants to cut them, I would greatly increase them personally. Drink your cool aid, I'll drink mine. I suspect we'll both live in a more fucked up state in 4 years, maybe then you'll be open minded to an alternative
33. Commie? Haven‚Äôt read a book before, have ya?
34. Me and 180000 others I guess? Yeah whatever ü§°
35. We have to many people in the country, millions more aren‚Äôt the answer. Their policy is to bring in people to vote them into powerüòÇ and it works but not this election. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs racist‚Äùü§° not racist just dosent accept races that don‚Äôt accept us, why should we accept muslims when they kill and rape innocent women and children? Not just here and there it‚Äôs written into their whole religion, women can‚Äôt be educated they can‚Äôt do this that whatever elseüòÇ I agree with her. And for Asians and whatever else, go live in their country and see how welcome you feel. Your idea or the western woke worlds idea of racism isn‚Äôt racism, it‚Äôs pretending to feel hurt for others. Boohoo.
36. Thanks Christ... She, however, was dumb enough to say what her former Newman government colleagues were thinking
37. So a Private Member's Bill goes to a vote of the house. All MPs vote, yeah? You don't think one or two (dozen) LNP MPs will vote as directed by their religious masters? Let's see......
38. Then the mines will close down - it wasn‚Äôt long ago they were being out into care & maintenance, then there‚Äôs no money & no jobs. Anyway, as you say we can both enjoy our cool-aid.
39. I've read books. What the ALP should have done is purged all of the left leaning elements and gone hard conservative.
40. üò¨
41. Oof sounds like you've had that brewing inside of you for a while just desperate to be released üòÜ
42. By your logic as most of the country doesn‚Äôt accept you, get out. There is a reason one nation isn‚Äôt in power.
43. Nah I dont think they will
44. The mines won‚Äôt close. Queensland is a safe place to operate with existing infrastructure. It is much easier for them to work here, even with higher royalties, than it is to operate in other places that have lower royalties. How do we know? All the mines that are still operating with the higher royalties. They‚Äôre our resources.
45. Spot doesn‚Äôt count :)
46. Your mum said that last night.üòÜü§íüèåÔ∏è
47. ‚ÄúGet out‚ÄùüòÇü§° 8% is enough for me to vote one nation again.
48. 1-2% below the greens. 7%above any independent. 166000 qlders. No small number.
49. Its all well and good saying ‚Äúwe are united as a party‚Äù, but they have to play politics for one, and they also are unfortunately made up of some seriously religious individuals. Considering it came so close in SA not more than a few weeks ago, it is a very real possibility. Katter has made it extremely clear he wants to make a change, theres only so much the leader can control. Like many other governments (not even just the LNP) opinions change and when leaders are put under pressure they will choose staying in power rather than a spill, and I‚Äôd safely say this will be a point of contention for the factions of the LNP and KAP for the next 4 years.
50. "Surely the leopards won't eat *my* face."
51. They‚Äôre not paying the higher royalties at the moment as the price has fallen‚Ä¶mines go into C&M when prices fall to below production costs‚Ä¶they‚Äôre not printing cash regardless of market conditions. Some posters seem to think you could charge 50% of sales as a royalty & there‚Äôd be no consequences‚Ä¶
52. A weak leader like Crisafulli can't control anything.
53. Considering strong leaders like Howard, Hawke and Rudd have all had problems keeping there parties in line, I really doubt this bloke will
54. They LNP literally screamed about a youth crime epidemic all election. ü§£ü§£
55. "Bill Shorten - THE BILL AUSTRALIA CAN'T AFFORD" - LNP main slogan for the 2019 Election...
56. Huh? The LNP ran an entire scare campaign based off youth crime. What are you talking about?
57. As apposed to every liberal campaign ever lol
58. Don't forget the removal of coal royalty taxes which are helping our states funding.
59. I wish people wouldn't vote so emotionally... people love to say lefties are completely irrational, then trust their "gut feelings" that Labor have been in too long or somehow causing crime and inflation. I guess you can't really blame them because the complicated truth is not pretty.
60. I just want the stupid Americanised culture wars to stop. I recall watching a speech from the leader of the Australian Christian Lobby about 5/6 years back. He said 2 things that alarmed me. One was that basically they were going to branch stack ALP branches with religious folk and warned them against letting their religious agenda be known until they got elected. The second thing he said that terrified me was that the world needed a really good war again to turn people back to Jesus. I can‚Äôt understand how people like this walk around thinking they are the ‚Äògood‚Äô people.
61. The LNP ran a scare campaign on crime and sent dishonest election material to every household in QLD with lies about labor policy.
62. I could be wrong, but I thought Labor campaigned on positive policies and outcomes, while the LNP seemed to focus ONLY on the normal rates of youth crime, which have actually been trending down for 3 decades or so. But it worked! They won. Well, I‚Äôm of the view that Albanese cost Miles the election.
63. Give it a week and the Murdoch media minions will be posting youth crime statistics showing they're down and give LNP the credit, despite being in steady decline already.
64. Labor doesn't need to learn anything. Queenslanders just needs to eat shit for a whole term to know what's good for them.
65. NZ is on its knees after voting National. Literally the worst economy in decades.
66. I hope Labor doesn't use this to give up on their forward thinking policies. They could've done better reassuring voters about youth crime. Launched investigations into the few but highly publicized cases of youth reoffenders on bail. It's a shame what we've lost
67. I mean whether you think it was a scare campaign or not it nearly worked lol. Labor were nowhere 2 weeks ago and nearly pulled a Bradbury as the LNP fell over its collective dick.
68. I dunno man, typically it's progressives that claim the moral high ground on pretty much all the hot-button topics you've outlined... now it's the conservatives trying to claim back some of that moral outrage for political gain. The whole thing is toxic AF.
69. You need Specsavers. LNP had the scare campaign and the absolute lies. LNP vitriol is despicable
70. The abortion issue did flip the election, it was the massive prepoll that ruined it for labor since only 30% of the vote was cast on Election Day. If the election was only yesterday labor would have won
71. Was that Labour though? I have been watching what's going on in the USA. Then I see Katters making their abortion statement, then the LNP will not say they are against it and what do you have? The USA on our doorstep.
72. Reduce youth crime but ban late stage abortions. Good logic there, clearly no one at LNP nor their voters have read Freakonomics
73. OP. Vitriol and scare campaigns...Labor. Irony. 1. Howard. Coalition. Stop the boats. 2. Abbot. Everything. Climate. Energy 3. Turnbull. Killed by his own party...SlowMo Negative gearing 4. Dutton. Restart climate wars..energy. NUCLEAR energy. ( Toxic waste 50000 years!!). ALL stakeholders agree it is not financially viable solution..but Dutton will press forward anyway..knowing it's wrong but creating a wedge to campaign on. Great disservice to the party and country. Are you in yr right mind. Agreed vitriol does not assist process
74. Lol, even if the abortion stuff was a scare campaign (it wasn't) I would say it worked really well! Clawed Labor back from wipeout to small/moderate loss. That's a very successful campaign. Sure, not a win, but much better than expected 6 months ago - would recommend again! And of course ignoring the irony of the party of scare campaigns complaining about a scare campaign.
75. Lol that's the funniest thing I've read all day. Pretty sure I saw numerous posts in Reddit from Brisbane residents receiving a flyer that were like "crazy Greens want to legalise meth" or some shit. Seems legit
76. Down to his post election speech Steven is true to government. Though as it seems ain‚Äôt much room in politics for good governance.
77. Dutton will go nuclear next year. Making Australia Scared Again. Unfortunately this is a winning strategy for the LNP and the CLP.
78. They work just fine for the LNP though.
79. Are you fucking serious ? The hypocrisy reeks
80. So there a hate and lies spread about party members on both sides, these have been proven for years not to work but instead the parties continue. They need to run on policies to get the votes
81. But vitriol and scare campaigns are literally what LNP use to win elections ü§î because it‚Äôs all that they‚Äôve got to offer to hide their own bullshit
82. Cry harder.
83. Abortion law change scare campaign (legitimate threat) nearly flipped the election. I hate scare campaigns but your hit take is not based in reality. Scare campaigns work
84. No they won't learn that. Just look at this subreddit. As a leftie and a swing voter, I'm pretty disgusted.
85. " I‚Äôm looking towards to abortion being banned'" Come on Henny Penny. Take a deep breath and have a Latte ( or something stronger) the sky is not going to fall down.
86. News just in: reddit users find out they are in the far-left minority
87. Odds are Albo has wasted our last chance for a Murdoch RC and truth in media and political advertising that would overwhelmingly benefit Labor across the country. America here we come.
88. They are people who intentionally want us to suffer and they vote for LNP mess to make it happen. I personally used know a number of people who deliver pleasure from other's pain and misery. LNP gives these people what they want, while giving other benefit of doubt that these policies have some benevolent intentions.
89. Harhar, you lose
90. I can taste all the salty tears being released here, Forest Gump is out, move on
91. So how do you explain the 2019 federal election?
92. Maybe hysterically screaming in to an echo chamber about how the Nazis are coming for your HRT‚Äôs was an ineffective use of resources? You‚Äôre still doing it though, which I guess helps with the grief of losing.
93. Youth crime rates are trending down, as the data actually shows, yet the LNP managed to convince enough hicks and rednecks in the regions through a scare campaign, aided & abetted by the Murdoch media! (Comment edited after being alerted to fact I was ranting at the wrong recipient üëçüôèüèº)
94. Are you really comfortable with youth criminals breaking into homes and attacking people without any repercussions? We need to acknowledge that Gen Z and Alpha must learn to respect authority, and the LNP is the only party addressing this issue. I‚Äôm pleased with the LNP‚Äôs victory; it signifies the end of Labor‚Äôs decade-long governance, which has largely contributed to the youth crime, housing, and health crises we‚Äôre facing today.
95. You lost bro ü§£. Be great if the new government closes the gender clinic, but I‚Äôm not holding my breath.
96. Still squawking...
97. Womp womp
98. Nice troll
99. Maybe it is rose tinted glasses but I remember the libs caring about facts more than feelings. They sure as hell don't have a claim on the high road now, unless they are referring to whatever the hell they are smoking.
100. * cries in youth crime*
101. Is this the US election?
102. The OP is taking the piss right ?
103. Wait, so your saying that having the position of dismembering babies, castrating children under the age of 14 in the name of gender ideology and punishing the victim of a crime and letting the criminal walk away Scott-free is the position with the moral high ground?
104. Sarcasm. The lowest form of wit.
105. Yes murdering babies should be illegal. How can people argue it
106. Take the L for Labor and cope.
107. [deleted]
108. [deleted]
109. A youth crime that factually didn‚Äôt even exist.
110. ‚ÄúVoted for hope over fear‚Äù can‚Äôt believe he called out fear as if his whole campaign wasn‚Äôt fear mongering over youth crime. In his speech he said Queenslanders voted for ‚Äúhope over fear‚Äù Hope of regression, fear of progress.
111. And a patient tax (also fictitious)
112. I honestly think they won for one simple reason - Labor was in power That's not to say it has anything to do with Labor's actions, just the fact that they were in power
113. Labor kept trying to tell people Campbell Newman was coming for them.
114. Been to Townsville, sir? Didn‚Äôt think so.
115. Don‚Äôt forget ‚Äòman tits Bill‚Äô. Body shaming over his figure from the same party that gave us‚Ä¶ Scott Morrison.
116. UnbelievaBill
117. Oh, you mean Alleged Rapist Bill Shorten? Who, aged 20, allegedly raped Kathy Sheriff when she was 15 at a Young Labor conference?
118. Its a quote they made. OP is being sarcastic.
119. All you ever see from Libs and Murdoch is the greyscale ALP MP and giant Red figures. Its so 2000s and dated and just cringe. Yet, cookers and boomers still fall for it.
120. Yeah. How dare we receive anything for the removal of *our* non renewable resources. QLD is mining corpo land you you‚Äôll like it! /s
121. I can‚Äôt find anything about them getting rid of coal royalties. Queensland has had royalties on coal since forever. And before Labor increased royalties a couple of years ago, the last party to increase royalties was the LNP, so they both seem to be in favour of having coal royalties. Why all of a sudden do we think they‚Äôre going to get rid of coal royalties?
122. That‚Äôs not happening‚Ä¶go read about how coal royalties work.
123. The issue people had with royalties is that they were implemented over night without consultation. No wonder BHP is fleeing QLD.
124. Oh no, I‚Äôm very happy to blame people who vote for regressive nonsense. There‚Äôs some strong ‚Äúbut I didn‚Äôt think the leopards would eat MY face‚Äù energy to come.
125. People from the left have been statistically proven repeatedly to be more intelligent. The "complicated truth" the right promotes is often full of bullshit, and anachronisms about the false ideology that "it was better in the old days..." Humanity as a whole presses forward, social conservatism has a genetic factor, we don't know what purpose it serves exactly but it revolves around fear of change and difference. Maybe if you were living in a cave 60thousand years ago it may have served a basic survival purpose. We don't live in caves, the world is generally safe, and you're not going to be eaten by a saber tooth tiger walking out your door.
126. *LNP* sorry (fast stubby thumb typing)
127. And the greens. They sent out flier material saying the greens were trying to legalise hard drugs like 'heroin and ice'
128. Almost all the Labor posters and ads I saw were just talking shit about the LNP and not anything positive. "Cut Crisafulli before he cuts you" should sound familiar
129. I figured it‚Äôd be the same as the federal government and ‚Äòboat people‚Äô, where reporting just stops completely and we only hear the rhetoric they spout about it supposedly being down
130. 'We stopped the boats. I mean youth crime'
131. Labour since December 7th 1989. Out of power from 1996-1998 and 2013-2015, I think? That‚Äôs a lot better than the other states and territories, I would imagine.
132. Assuming the little grub and his brood of maggots don't get through changes to preferential voting etc.
133. üëÜüëÜüëÜ
134. Yeah the sad reality is worldwide, that people learn to distrust conservatives the hard way
135. Come on man. You know that isn‚Äôt the reason. The person who drove us there has been banished from her own country.
136. I completely doubt it. They went from an absolute flogging of a landslide to a decent loss, over the span of weeks. And Miles is staying on. QLD will be licking it's wound soon enough.
137. It‚Äôs the problem with every ‚Äúepidemic‚Äù the media wants to push, usually it‚Äôs a couple of highly public cases that get repeated over and over for weeks/months, then bought up again once there a trial etc. It *feels* like stuff is happening way more than it is and keeps it in the public‚Äôs memory. Until the next thing comes up and they pivot to that and forget the previous issue even happened. I don‚Äôt doubt that there are some problems that need to be addressed, but making it more visible doesn‚Äôt magically mean it‚Äôs happening more and it makes a mockery of the people actually affected by stuff because you can no longer talk rationally about it without getting shouted down.
138. They already have. Federal Labor now has a policy of pushing house prices as high as possible. Via extreme immigration of course. That‚Äôs a long way from the policy they brought to the last election.
139. A ‚Äúnearly Bradbury‚Äù, is a loss
140. Roe V. Wade was overturned in the USA, leading to abortion becoming a criminal offence in 14 states of the USA. Just because you're ignorant doesn't mean this stuff doesn't happen.
141. I thought you could only get an abortion if the woman‚Äôs life is in danger? What is the actual law in QLD and what might change?
142. Be pro-women‚Äôs health, pro-people‚Äôs right to live their lives, anti-reeducation camps for kids make you far left? Guess I‚Äôm far left then lol
143. If anyone tries to come after my daughters bodily autonomy I'll go full fucking Stalin if I have to.
144. Actually, you will find that the story on abortion rights came from media reports an LNP candidate let slip. It wasn‚Äôt Labor misinformation. So welcome to the misinformation club. But will your ego allow acknowledging it? Young rich Aussie.
145. See the thing is, I don't think the left is a minority in Queensland, I think it's a majority and people are voting against there interest.
146. It‚Äôs why people don‚Äôt like the general public. The way people act when they lose, or have a different opinion to them. It‚Äôs full Chernobyl in here this morning.
147. Read the post again lol. I‚Äôm in complete agreement with you
148. No, but I also recognise that the LNP will do fuck all about any youth crime issue. It‚Äôs always all rhetoric and slogans that‚Äôll disappear the moment they‚Äôre in power.
149. Yeah that's what the state needs, less healthcare
150. Sex abusers should be shot and human body right to bodily autonomy should be federal law.
151. So an abusive partner can be given the right to abuse the pregnant partner AND a child further, by forcing the person to remain pregnant and probably later attempting to gain custody of the infant to repeat the cycle? Don't pretend there aren't "unintended" consequences to giving men the right to determine if someone else should end a pregnancy.
152. üòÇü§£üòÇü§£
153. It does in regional areas... Areas like Townsville are clearly sensitive to economic pressures like covid and the post-pandemic rate increases. I'm a staunch labor voter but labor historically does not campaign very hard in Townsville. It messed up federal labor in 2019 and lost them 3 state seats this election. I pulled the juvenile offender data for queensland because I'm not naive enough to think the problems don't exist. Have a look at [Townsville LGA vs Brisbane LGA](https://imgur.com/a/6utBhmb). Juvenile offender rates have only dropped in the last 8-9months for Townsville which unfortunately makes the "crime wave" a fresh memory for many voters.
