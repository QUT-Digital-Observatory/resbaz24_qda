Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Bro discovered the word "sanctimonious" yesterday and can't stop using it in an effort to try and boast what little intellect he has, like an insecure high school kid. I'm allowed to be upset by an election result fuckwit, your hurr derr statement of "majority wins suck it up" makes no difference to how I and many others feel. I wasn't questioning the integrity of the election result.
2. This type of reply was anticipated. Well done.
3. I know you never said it was free, the clown I first replied to said it was free. And as for my false information, I was correct it was added to another bill but I didn't realise it had been taken off the electricity bill and put on the rates. I have to get them both out and have a look. So If someone owns multiple properties then they are paying multiple times for the ambulance levy(tax) then?
4. Now you're getting abusive. Every generation manages to produce the exploiting class. Mine is no exception, nor will yours be.
5. Lol you think going to university raises IQ? 🤣🤣
6. Think in terms of class, not age. We all know LNP skews older, but blaming a generation doesn't help anything. The senior leadership of ALP are boomers. Boomers arent a class, they aren't a monolith. They're usually the most impacted by LNP policies too. Many in this sub are on your side, so ask yourself what distinguishes them from others their age. and your bitterness isn't helping you or anyone else. I get it, it's a tough pill to swallow. I've spent many years being bitter about this too, but your kind of thinking is exactly what creates this generational divide in the first place. Make no mistake, many of us will sound just like the boomers do in 40 years. The old shitting on the young and vice versa is a tale as old as time.
7. Who says I’m getting upset? Seriously, we boomers will be dead and gone soon. So less and less skin in the game. Many of us do care about the future. I have grand kids whose future is very much under threat. My point is that it is intellectually lazy to scape -goat a generation. And as I mentioned previously, the election results don’t back-up your hypothesis.
8. There is at least one generation that will have to pay economically for the downsizing of planetary population, because we cannot exponentially reproduce forever. Blaming people because they were born during a favourable economic period is muddleheaded. Sure, blame older voters *now* for voting for selfish decisions but, unless you're some kind of saint, you'd likely do the same thing in their circumstances. >Not everyone is as selfish as your generation champ I deliberately have gone childfree and support economic policies that benefit younger generations, such as removal of negative gearing; even though I am benefiting from negative gearing. I also support policy that benefits people yet to be born and put my money exactly where my mouth is. I donate to lobby groups for policies that I will never live to benefit from. So, tell me exactly how unselfish your generation will be. Gen Z is the largest generation in huma history and is eating the planet. How will Gen Z be remembered? The generation that saw the last tree in the Amazon? The generation that saw the last coral in the Great Barrier Reef? The generation that kept Bangladeshi climate refugees out of Australia? The generation that saw the greatest increase in extinctions in human history? That's what's coming and that's how your generation will be remembered. Is that your fault?
9. People who live week to week don't proactively save for rego mate. I know because I've been there. When you're on the edge you just pay rego when you can and live like shit until your next pay. For people in that 50 to 100 dollars means a lot.
10. Literally people telling you here it helped and your arguing it didn't, against them personally. That is the proof first hand
11. You've never lived in poverty, have you?
12. That one, tiny, first step in easing living costs? Maybe not, but combined with some other policies and incentives it could have made a difference to the people struggling the most. You go on like labour said "20% rego cut and our work here is done" then stopped thinking about the issue at all. In the next 4 years they could have introduced more policy to help ease price creep and inflated expenses, but no, we have to enable the boomers to finish fucking everything completely before they die out.
13. I was glad to read about that however knowing the LNP and their drive to privatise quite literally everything I wouldn't be surprised to see private prisons making their way back in.
14. Each to their own I guess, I would have a similar reaction if you showed me anything from Murdoch media. If you're still interested, [NSW parliament](https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/lc/papers/Pages/qanda-tracking-details.aspx?pk=96220) says it costs them $2,748.96 per day to keep a kid in juvenile detention. Which amounts to over a million dollars a year for one kid ($1,003,370.40). I'm aware this is Queensland sub but it wouldn't be a dissimilar number imo. Edit: and this is for 2021/22 under a decade old Liberal state government.
15. Yes,
16. 100% the kids might also stay in school as well.
17. Rehabilitation isn't the only component of the corrections system. There is also a component of punishment to make offenders pay their debt to society, a violent thing eho murders a mother and stabs her husband who laughs when police arest him has a significant debt to pay to society and I dont think 15 years cuts it. This wasn't your average run of the mill kid engaging in a bit of hellraising who'll settle down as he grows up. He had 75 previous convictions recorded and was only 17, with many of these convictions for violent offences at the time he committed this murder. I'm not some cold-hearted throw the book at 10 year old and lock them up for life type. I absolutely think good intervention programs and rehabilitation are the correct decisions, but there also needs to be a big stick available to punish kids like this.
18. If as you say most of these crimes are not premeditated but crimes of impulse and situational, how do you treat the material conditions. In a sane world "severely limits your ability to reiterate.. et al" would be considered a deterrent? But it sounds as if "the culture" has integrated prison time into its acceptable bounds and thus violence and theft is a tolerable norm. Pumping effort into reversing that seems sissiffian?
19. Are the centres rough? Or are they better than the kids would have to go back to? It does seem weird that you have to be sentenced to benefit, the long stay remand is a curiosity tho.. which implies to me anyway something larger is going on?
20. I suppose that having these things literally listed on your main website doesn't count as speaking about it to a person who does absolutely zero research beyond what they see on social media
21. Great, they're pushing a stadium through without any real plan. That'll be just like the Bridgewater bridge, a decade overdue and millions over budget. Or like the Spirit of Tasmania debacle. They've consistently proven they can't manage infrastructure, so why would a stadium be different?
22. We don’t need the fucking stadium that they estimated to cost around $2billion.. From Launceston to Smithton is 3 hours, from Launceston to Hobart is 2hours.. Why the fuck would I head to Hobart to go watch an AFL game? UTas stadium is perfect and hosts AFL games, if they want to build a stadium, how about spend half as much on upgrading utas stadium while also upgrading the infrastructure around invermay?
23. [deleted]
24. I can’t help you. You are far too gone. But making the world better for all IS making the world better for you. I’d imagine that you are closer to a homeless person than to a billionaire.
25. Three words: Near death experiences. Look up accounts on YouTube or read Bruce Greyson's book After.
26. their website currently doesn't display their policies, so I cannot comment. my only reply is that the way abortion is currently implemented works perfectly fine, and is accepted by both women that matter to me, and women I have heard in the community. So I agree with them that it doesn't need amending
27. A doctor being able to conscientiously object to a medical procedure is not a ‘very minor change’. You have a job, you do the job. If your religion prevents you from doing the job, you find another job. Plenty of remote communities and smaller towns where ‘find another doctor’ isn’t a ‘very minor’ issue. People shouldn’t be able to force their own religious views on others by denying service. Especially in healthcare
28. When the hell did tax cuts become labor policy? Most in northern Queensland are in the low taxation brackets anyway. Crime can reduce all people want but because regional towns are smaller, that crime is amplified and people want solutions, not statistics. They fucked up, they needed to dedicate more funding to crime much earlier no matter what it takes.
29. R U OK? Bigots.
30. At least Victoria isn't about to host the Olympics
31. The reality is that this type of thing in North Brisbane alone happens most nights, usually to several homes a night. It’s not a one off occurrence that occasionally happens, it’s a very frequent nightly occurrence. I’m pleasantly surprised when it doesn’t happen some nights. Victims of crime aren’t given any voice and especially in the courts they are treated like the suspects sometimes. It’s very sad and disheartening.
32. WTF are you on about? A subjective experience? Fact - Home was invaded Fact - Car was stolen Fact - It scared the hell out of her. Fact - Irreplaceable items were stolen. And ole mate her reckons, "Nah, you're all whinging about stuff that's just an insurance issue. It's not a big deal." I wonder if he'd think the same if he was one of the assault victims. And as for stats, except for a sharp drop during COVID, youth offences per 100,000 population have been on the rise since 2014 (the last 10 years). Taken from the same ABC article that reckons youth crim is decreasing: [https://ibb.co/RGKVZPs](https://ibb.co/RGKVZPs)
33. Don't you have a home your kids can stay in? My younger kids will be living with us forever for the same reason. I didn't vote LNP, but I also don't downplay crime as being merely an inconvenient insurance claim either. I also don't equate not being able to afford a house with having someone invade where you do live and steal your gear. No need to be a prick about it.
34. Instead, your plan is to let them out the next day and let them reoffend immediately. Lookup reoffending stats and get back to me.... My social worker friends tell me how little the current system works and how they literally see the same kids every week because there is no punishment. Kids know they can get away with it. Force some reason to make them stop.
35. Well we are living in a different reality because the stats show a marked increase from that period, especially in violent crime
36. lol so you think qualitative just equals anecdotal? Bros gotta be a stem major. You have not addressed my main point at all; if crime is going down (which it hasn’t over labors tenure) why didn’t labor run hard on that this election? Why don’t you examine your own parties failures instead of insulting the voter base
37. 🤡
38. Even if you think so, they still won because a majority of people preferred their policies. If you really hate your neighbours that much you could always move to somewhere like Melbourne, where more people will align with your sentiments.
39. And your experts are still "dude trust me"
40. Waste. Of. Space. Go fuck yourself.
41. They’re really not. Woman support trans rights at a massive rate compared to men. Edit: actually I just double checked and this isn’t as pronounced as I thought, purely because Australians as a whole are more supportive of trans rights as I thought. Woman are only about 10% more supportive of trans people (at about 71%) supportive vs 61% for men.
42. his influence on the result. My argument is that his influence did not cost labor in the election. interesting enough and well done to qld no Hanson party influence
43. In my other comments I counter your point that crime is going down. Yes there’s a slight downward trend but that is for all crimes , not serious and non violent included like marijuana possession. The actual crimes which effect people, violent crime serious crime, is trending upward. This is the reality.
44. have to strongly disagree. I paid an extremely high financial cost with stand downs, that I will never forget nor be compensated for. There is no such thing as working from home in my profession. The excessive spending from covid has yet to cease. WA government alone spent 600million on RAT’s and then slugged taxpayers $4mil to dump them. You’re also referring to infrastructure that hasn’t been updated since the 1970’s with our beef roads. They can afford to send some infrastructure funding back to the regions. Rather than building Olympic venues.
45. I'm not sure what you mean here lady?
46. dictatorial control. And how do you think that will happen?
47. You said state owned petrol. That means that the government owns all the fuel.
48. And thus can control you by that. Same with going Cashless and next will be the food.
49. Well yeah
50. No ive known that word for a while bro , it’s just very fitting for your attitude and the best part is you just keep playing more and more into it . I’m so sorry you have to live in a state full of so many inferior people , like I’m sure you would usually love that but given those troglodyte”s now get to call the shots it must be deeply upsetting for you . I hope you survive the next 4 years 🙏
51. This type of reply was anticipated. Well done.
52. Turns out I was wrong too and the emergency services levy only funds the fire service and is applicable for each property. [Emergency services levy](https://www.fire.qld.gov.au/compliance-and-planning/em-levy) So I am now saying that ambulance is free for QLD residents. "There's no cost for ambulance treatment and transport for Queensland residents. This includes treatment and transport that takes place in other parts of Australia." [QAS Cost](https://www.ambulance.qld.gov.au/our-services/emergency-ambulance-response)
53. Jesus fucking christ, you are slow. There is no difference in saying the ambulance service in QLD is free, and going for a walk on the footpath is free, or a drive down the road is free, or taking your kids to the playground is free, or being rescued by a lifeguard is free, or the fire and police departments are free - a rate / charge / levy / tax is charged somewhere to provide this service “free to the community”. It is not “user pays” in QLD, because even if you don’t pay the applicable rate / charge / levy / tax you can still access the service without additional cost. In most other States you opt in or out, and will be charged on a user pays system. This is not some complex scenario, but it has clearly overwhelmed your abilities.
54. That’s not abusive all I spoke was facts lol this is the problem with your snowflake generation
55. Yeah i do. IQ isn’t rigid. The more education you receive during the brains developmental years the better. See you’re thinking of the arts majors I’m more thinking of the real degrees in STEM fields
56. The generational divide was created by 5-6 decades of policies that only benefited their generation not because of someone pointing this out headass
57. Because it's easy to get mad and blame your right wing boomer mum, dad, or uncle who constantly parrots Murdoch media talking points and rants about the "woke left" at every opportunity when you have to live with it and I assume that most of the younger leftists complaining are in a similar situation. Edit: also statistically right wingers have more kids so there's probably more young leftists with boomer families to complain about.
58. I suggest you look at how many humans the earth can support we are so far away from that point it’s not funny. Nobody alive even knows someone whose great great grandchildrens great great grandchildren who would be alive for that day. I’ve stated the point three times you just must be really thick or have poor reading comprehension. Not once have I blamed them for being born into a favourable economic position. This was always how it worked. What I’m blaming them for, is when they turned 40 and got involved in politics RATHER than make policies to ensure the NEXT generation ALSO are born into favourable economic position they kept making policies that ONLY served their generation and people with established wealth.. Then you go ahead and talk about all the policies you support guess what, your generation doesn’t. Surely you can see then where this is a problem if your generation all adopted those beliefs we wouldn’t be in this position. But they don’t. Because you are apart of the single worst generation in human history Not a hard concept to grasp bro and it’s not my idea this is factual. Read any book on the topic this is the conclusion
59. Those people were getting screwed more over under Labor with High cost of living , highest rent increases, high power bills, so $2 a week made no difference
60. It’s messed up that I could tell how they voted based on this alone.
61. I'm saying the the broad scheme, if $1.90 a week is saving your families then there's bigger issues. But let's not pretend it's been Labor in for the last 12 years /s
62. Did you just suggest that more Privately run prisons are now needed to hold all these offenders? OK, well I guess I have some Mates who are interested in helping the State out (and possibly making a buck for the efforts)
63. Maybe this is an unpopular opinion too, but "fear" of the system stopped me from doing a lot of dumb stuff as a kid. Not wanting to get in trouble from mum and dad, teachers, the police. Now that I'm an adult and can understand the impacts my choices can have on others, I don't feel the "fear" anymore, but when children aren't fully mentally developed, not wanting to spend "life in jail" like XYZ did, might be enough of a deterrent. Proactive and rehabilitation approaches should be the priority, but extreme cases should have a pathway for extra punishment to ensure it is not a standard that gets set. I'm 100% sure if it were a bigger, more "famous" person, that child wouldn't have got 15 years. Could you imagine if they'd stabbed the wife of a prime minister? Or someone that the country all knew? That family and her community will be impacted forever. Not knowing better isn't enough of a reason to think the behaviour was okay.
64. Yeah “kids”. And you can use extreme outliers to determine broad policy.
65. Just been reading an article about the story. “Mr Lynch told the court there were no previous offences of violence and this was the first time he had entered a house while armed”. So no history of violence here. Notes on his upbringing “At just 10-years-old he left his mother’s house where he was exposed to violence and excessive use of alcohol. He went to live with his aunty and uncle, where his mother called him infrequently and never visited. The only “real nurturing and love” and “stability” experienced by the teen came from his grandmother, however they would only speak on the phone, Mr Lynch told the court. Her death sent him into a “downward spiral” and during this time he became inseparable with another boy”. He was on probation and he rehab entailed 45 minutes a week with a case worker and that’s it. Hardly a set up for success. Also, the maximum for an adult for the same crime is 20 years or so. Max he could get was 70 percent of the adult charge.
66. Violent crimes, theft, DV and substance abuse all intersect with poor Socio-economic opportunities. The stresses of poverty have an extreme negative impact on mental health, leading to poorer decision making, poorer health, increased risk of drug abuse to cope, thus leading to increased contact with drug dealers, violent situations, disease transmission, etc. They lack the finanical security to keep up with cost of living or emergencies. They can only afford low quality goods which require frequent replacements, can't buy in bulk, have no room for leisure activities, persuing hobbies or passions. Little to no asset accumulation. No home ownership. The most common source of conflict in relationships is income. When poor financial security, substance abuse and poor education mingle, you get DV. Young people exposed to such environments often go on to do the same things, often in more extreme ways since they lack maturity and restraint. They have less investment in education, their local school may already lack funding, their ability to persue higher education or a decent job is bottlenecked. Areas with these issues are more regularly policed, and since the justice system fails to rehabilitate, those who enter the system are worse off than before. On and on it goes, you can see how these things all reinforce each other and make any single issue listed much worse. Poverty is the fundamental driver. Cost of living needs to be addressed. Affordable housing, lower grocery prices, stronger and cheaper healthcare, better school funding with more resources, stronger public infrastructure, cheaper transport options, strong social programs that promote community intergation, better wages. There are many way to tackle the issue of crime, and prevention is better than punishment.
67. long stay remand is a direct result of the courts process taking so long. but instead of building more courts they keep building detention centres which continues to clog the courts and exacerbate the problem. centres are rough as fuck, but the majority of these kids are homeless or being abused at home.
68. At least they do something.
69. No one is expecting people from smithton to travel down other than once in a blue moon. Libs are great. Someone has to push things forward. If not for them we would have nothing other than dirty hippies with woolen beanies
70. No, people only develop empathy when they either have nothing to gain or nothing to lose.
71. I'm close to neither. I'm thoroughly middle class. I'm aspirational though, which means I want policies that will assist my aspirations. I would climb over a million people to become a billionaire, and then yes, in that situation once I had satisfied myself I would likely be more interested in philanthropy. I think that's a pretty normal cycle for those who are self made billionaire's though.
72. Even these mild changes are unlikely. But if they went through, would they have impacted the women who matter to you and the women in the community? I doubt it would have impacted anything because I don't think there are many (if any) women seeking abortions of a post 22-week viable baby because of their social situation. The biggest change would have been the inconvenience of having to find a doctor willing to give you an abortion if the first doctor you see conscientiously objects. The point is that the scare campaign was based on nothing.
73. Doctors in QLD can already consciencely object. They just have to refer you to someone who doesn’t.
74. Like offering tax cuts to working families, or promising free lunches to children, even proposing a voice to parliament for disadvantaged indigenous communities. Crime is not as inflated as the media wants you to think. Statistics are literally the truth
75. May I suggest a dictionary?
76. It’s not a contest
77. you should really look at the crime heat map
78. it's subjective because it is *her* experience, and is not replicated across every break & enter.
79. You literally said as in people's sentiment and anecdotal experience. Bringing up your fucking methods of research doesn't discount the fact that on a statical average, crime has gone down. Objectively. Plain and simple. You don't know better because you go to uni.
80. Not smart enough to think of a comeback I see. Weird ass dude…
81. Bro it's not a matter of opinion lmao those media outlets exist to prop up their political agendas for personal gain. It's not about what I think here. I don't need to be reminded they won a majority, hence why this post exists in the first place. I am not contesting the result. It's rich that you're trying to explain democracy, yet refuse to acknowledge to hold the media has on the public is inherently undemocratic.
82. And the Arbus will very likely fly. Vs the De-Wormer-200X built by me. Based off my "research". Which will likely do the opposite.
83. lol
84. Dude, if you took away all media bias as well as opinions and only reported on pure fact, people would despise the LNP.
85. There was no work from home for me either, 34 years in Road Construction,.
86. Of course you don't
87. It won't. Cherry picking one aspect of our lives that the government wants to financially aid is not dictatorial.
88. State owned petrol STATIONS. Work on your reading comprehension. Holy shit.
89. Wait until you hear about laws. Oh my, the control. It MUST be fascism. Wipe off the crumbs from your mouth, have a shower, and go outside. You've been isolated for so long that you forgot how our society operates.
90. As if what we were already given wasn't good?? Are you kidding me?
