Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. You think QR has the budget to install all those cameras, the data processing and storage for all that data? Same for buses... Why spend that money when they can get the data they need from card tap ons
2. The data centre costs to do that scale of facial recognition tracking would be immense. Far more expensive than just using a card system that is already installed.
3. which is why state labor wanted to take control of Brisbane's buses, putting it in line with the rest of the state.
4. Thanks. That was more than I would have guessed. It's not obvious to me how you could get the detailed info you get from go card usage without privacy invasion of riders.
5. And because you didn't need your car. If you required your car, I'm sure you would have appreciated the road options not being hamstrung to force people to use PT, right? It's not one or the other. Both need to function as best and efficiently as they can. Tunnels being free would help with congestion.
6. Won't change the number of people on the road. It will increase the number of people using them to skip from a to b rather than using surface roads blocking up those intersections. You know. The whole point of building tunnels. Easing traffic through intersections vehicles don't need to be going through. Your point is from the model of a for profit tunnel. Which is of course, isn't about traffic congestion and what's best for city traffic.
7. Yup. People who complain about cyclists not paying don't understand that the amount of damage cars do means the cyclist is actually saving them money.
8. And rego going up is largely a result of insurers raising their rates.
9. like the discounted PT fares.
10. Systems that need to have an interface with an accounting system are definitely more complex to implement and will cost more. And people movement is only complex if you’re going to insist on the latest let’s use a camera and AI tech. Transport companies have been tracking journeys for centuries now.
11. Agree. It covers from Sunshine Coast to Gold Coast passing through Brisbane, easily a 200km distance, compared to 3km in Melbourne.
12. Yes, but the point stands, how is Melbourne able to operate that system for free, and Brisbane unable to?
13. Same way every reputable organisation manages big data. It isn't stored in a big spreadsheet it's in relational tables with staff able to access only the ones relevant to their job, and ability to query the database directly usually limited to privileged users in your data analytics team. Extra sensitive stuff like credit card numbers should be encrypted and accessible to nobody. Eg. A customer service rep might be able to look up user accounts but only one at a time and it'll only have your address and contact details, maybe some recent charge and payment history. Probably not your entire travel history.
14. Huh?? I clearly stated I didn’t NEED my car due to their awesome tram/train network.
15. Actually it does increase the number of people on the road by attracting new road users. Look up induced demand. You’ll get people using public transport to also start using roads with more options available.
16. Us cyclists are paying rego on cars we don't drive.
17. As someone working in the "AI space"... Nope. And anything else would be less effective and a waste of money. Having a user initiated action, even with accounting behind it, is far cheaper than complex code tracking, or pad sensors, or even a man with a clicker. Also... They already set it up. It's working, and implemented. Anything else would be more expensive simply because of the rollout. Public Transport has been tracked for centuries... By ticket sales.
18. Obviously, this is by road rather than rail, but Tweed Mall to Gympie North station is 276 km. I'm not 100% sure, but I think SEQ is the largest (in area) single-ticket urban public transport system in the world.
19. Because they're only losing the data for travel within the city which isn't a huge loss of data and they don't need to be tracking it as much as travel out of the city. They aren't gonna add or remove services based on inner city travel as the tram services are designed for those entering and leaving the city, not staying in the city. If you do free fares, we lose all the data of how people are travelling around the entire SEQ - not just the CBD like Melbourne. They can do free public transport but we lose the crucial data that is tracking usage to make sure we are utilising our network as efficiently as possible. 50c is the easiest way to make it as cheap as possible without requiring the huge costs of patron tracking through other methods.
20. I mean how do you gather the info? Management would be the same as the go card data once it's gathered.
21. I'm clearly talking about people who DO need their cars. Did you miss that part twice? Tradies and other services can't take their tools with them. People using their freetime outside the city can't always use PT for their activities. Some workers not in Trades also cannot use PT no matter how good. Then there's others who, regardless of PT options will use their cars.
22. So you ARE saying that the only way public transport will be used is by hamstringing private vehicle use. Sounds like PT is a terrible option if it's a choice between what's absolutely necessary, private vehicles and what is just a nice choice, PT. Thanks for making my point. You'll have to go back to the drawing board and come up with a PT solution that doesn't require roads to be at their worst so people use PT. That is so fucking backwards. Or, you know, you can improve both to be their best and let people decide which they use. You know, don't be a fucking dictator.
23. It’s bigger than that - now most major regional cities have moved from QConnect to Translink, it’s effectively the same ticketing system ststewide (although Go Cards are still only SEQ, for now)
24. I see, thanks for the explainer!
25. I misunderstood you. Didn't realise you were suggesting a scenario starting over without any of the go card infrastructure. In which case I dunno. I was assuming they'd still have a similar NFI reader solution that you could use an app or bank card to tap on and off. Even if it's free I'm pretty sure bank cards can just do a $1 temporary hold, though idk if there's merchant fees associated.
26. Improving roads for people who use cars just incentives people to use cars more. Thus the loop continues until you have a 100 lane highway. Improving public transport and incentivising people to use it reduces congestion on roads and will provide a net benifit. Ultimately, the people who must continue to drive benifit. I've rarely seen a congested road outside of peak commute times. The capacity to server people who must use it already exists.
27. There are tradespeople in Holland who cycle a cargo-bike to work.
28. It might be one authority, but it's not the same ticketing system. This can be demonstrated by the fact you would need one ticket to travel in the train from Brisbane to Landsborough, and another to take the bus from there to Maleny. The SEQ area is still very much its own system. Why the Sunshine Coast Hinterland and Woodford/Kilcoy are excluded from it is beyond me, but they are.
29. You can do both. Or are ypu saying that PT sucks so much that you can have a perfect system but it won't be used unless the roads suck for private vehicles. If that's the case. PT should be put in the bin. If not, do both.
30. Over 100klms a day? With a 1 ton ride on lawn mower, a 50kilo walk behind, plus whipper snipper and all other gardening tools for example? How flat and large are they doing these rounds? Yes, SOME may be able to this. The vast majority of trades and services cannot.
31. You must be lucky. I constantly drive around on roads that have road works going on. Brisbane public transport isn't even close to been world class with regional areas practically been non existent. Not to mention even connecting these areas together. Look at the three tunnels they built in Brisbane. Don't even get utilised to their full extent because of tolls. That money would have been better spent on developing a metro.
32. Well, perhaps it’s time they look at other jobs - or maybe hardening up a bit 😂
33. Your last paragraph is the point. Read ALL the comments.
34. So you're aware you don't have a point to make and totally understand that people do require cars.
35. I mean, I voted Labor, but for people who are shocked by the result it's obvious to me that they've never spent any time talking to people outside of Brisbane.
36. [The Guardian wrote about how Labor had devastating losses in regional areas](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/27/devastating-losses-in-regional-queensland-show-labor-is-increasingly-being-consigned-to-the-cities), they need a plan to deal with it rather than just blaming media.
37. Only if you've no historical understanding of Qld state politics. Everything that happened in those areas this election, was pretty much the same as what happened in the past *before* anyone had Sky to blame. I'm no Sky "News" fan, and I think "After Dark" and the people on it are festering pustulant cancers on both society and democracy - but the election result wouldn't have been a surprise even in the days when neither existed.
38. This is the echo chamber effect. People from both sides of politics cannot accept that people hold different views because they are constantly saturated with messages from their own side (and downvote/ban anyone who disagrees with them). This is the same as responses to the failure of the voice referendum. People still bring up conspiracy theories because they can't accept that people actually voted no.
39. Yeah I don’t think Sky News really appeals to the swing voter.
40. You need to let it go and move on. If you really want to do something, go and find your local members and see how you can help them out for the next election.
41. You can't discredit the "it's time" factor in this election. The longer a government is in power, the harder it is for them to win elections. People just get tired of incumbent governments. It happens across the board - whether it's a Labor government or a coalition government.
42. Reading some of the comments, I think there are people who really underestimate the vias in he QLD media landscape. Last time I bothered to do the research and check, there were two total newspapers in QLD that weren't owned by a right wing media group, either Murdoch or Nine Entertainment. Those two were just small city newspapers as well, so of minimal impact. While 'no one reads newspapers' int he household in 2024, the front page of thecourier mail is what sets the discussion for every other news platform in the state, whether ABC, Nine news or Sky News. Fundamentally the media environment is skewed so deeply that it is impossible for Labor to run a 'good campaign' sghort of having speicifc and recent LNP failures to leverage. I think Labor spent too much time fighting the Greens and tryiong to apeal to the 'centre' swing voters whicvh I think the LNP picked up by just adopting some of the more popular Labor policies like 50c fares and being ominoously silent on the Public service with vague claims that they can save (they can't) the money they need by reducing contractors. Lots of 'left' parties are trying to out flank the conservative parties from the right and there has been a swing to the right as economic struggles have hit the world. I think it's trying to chase headlines, or minimise what they think are weaknesses, but i think it's a mistake. Now we get to see the outcome I suppose.
43. How? Democracy. Not that hard to understand, surely.
44. I'm right leaning, have a mix of left and right leaning family, friends and colleagues and the only people who reference sky news is the left. It's weird.
45. Yey, I mean let’s just import the US culture wars over here because it’s clear working so well for them 😬. I really think it’s these guys who are responsible for all the hate.
46. For all their shortcomings, one thing LNP is actually very good at is marketing and the "smear" of opponents. There's a reason they spend big bucks on it, because it works. The average voter is uniformed and generally apathetic to politics. They spend about 6 seconds every election cycle considering who they'll vote for. These people receive 99% of their political information from a large media source, which is usually a smear or a cringe slogan of some nature. Given Murdoch owns pretty much all the mainstream media, when the average voter does eventually tune in for that 6 seconds, the messaging will almost inevitably be pro LNP. Basically if you just play the same message on repeat, people have no choice but to believe it. Anyone who actually cares about policy doesn't vote for LNP (unless you're in their interest groups/big business). These people who are informed in the policy landscape are the minority. You would be horrified at the number of people who vote for LNP because their party colour is blue, or some arbitrary decision formula. There's lots of people out there who vote LNP because "mum and dad do, so I will". That's the extent of their reasoning. The truth is the average person just doesn't care enough about politics to do any research because in this country we have it so good they don't have to care.
47. Seems like more gaslighting to me. Much like trying to tell us here in northern regions crime is down because a statewide figure says so, and calling us racists, bogans, etc, when we called out the bullshit.
48. Sky News doesn't have THAT kind of reach, it's not Fox News (yet) in its appeal to mass voters.
49. Yeah yeah, everyone brainwashed by sky news says inner city douchebag who’s never drove more than an hour north of Brisbane.
50. It must blow your mind that people are able to think freely and make their own decisions without being influenced by "Sky News". There are just as many left wing as right wing news outlets and at some point you're just going to accept some people dont agree with what you do. Thats fine. Thats democracy.
51. Look into the Atlas Network and Australians For Prosperity. They're being funded by fossil fuel companies....
52. Never underestimate the ability of people to vote against their own best interests.
53. [deleted]
54. I haven’t seen the Sky News program leading the TV ratings which is surely the case if millions of idiots voted for the LNP because they watch it religiously…get a grip.
55. Election is over. Regardless of who you voted for its done and you can’t change it. Move on - we are supposed to accept election outcomes in Australia.
56. Labor have just lost touch with regional communities, they need a better strategy to win the hearts and minds, Gympie for example is a long held LNP seat, Tony perret does absolutely nothing for the electorate..but is a guaranteed win, Labor put zero effort into switching the electorate, they have just given up..the demographics are changing and this is now when Labor need to get in and get the groundswell behind them to make change..focus on young people in regional areas
57. The issue is simple, Anastasia left a poisoned government that was rife with allegations and dcandle and Miles did nothing to change this. His campaign was on what he had done and him trying to be hip with young people. LNP had 1 policy and ran with it, they were literally the only major party that said we will do this. Yes the abortion and other issues hurt them on the way to the finishing line but by then Miles had already been nero saying he had no vision and people needed to look to the past for what he had done.
58. What a lot of people are missing here is that when times are tough the general population look for a scapegoat and change. Even initiatives that favour the economy like 50 c fares get turned into "we the taxpayer fund this" or "I dont get the bus so why should I pay for others". Some politicians use this to even marginalise groups of society in some cases. People want an easy scape goat. Not an actual way out of their mess. LNP knew this which is why their plan lacked detail and why they won the election
59. 73% of Australians live in the major cities.
60. May want to use r/uBlockOrigin
61. I know it feels like shit when your side loses , but changes of government are part of voting. When things are going well people keep voting for the same side, when things arent going well people flip and try the opposite team. It’s just how politics works. If the LNP makes a mess of it they’ll be out in 4 years anyway.
62. Ahhhh, Sky News and Murdoch. Because Australia isn’t going to fuck itself !
63. Disgusts me that conservatism is taking over society…all the scared old fcks that just need to cark already 😮‍💨
64. So another "website" to get a point of view accross from a Business in the Business of getting their point of view accross in amongst millions of other sources of information..... hmmmm
65. For me I find it odd I know a lot of people Angy that Labour and Palachook got in again after how she handled COVID and a lot of other stuff and were saying please we need to get rid of her next time and then she up and quits anyway because no one liked her and her blatant abuse of the system I guess Miles was more liked but I have never liked him I found him fake and can't stand his fake smile and fake cheery attitude and for me I believe I was right about him seeing him such a sore loser at his concession speech where he was still being arrogant saying he would win i actually don't care for politics nothing really ever gets done all they do is argue do stupid things and are blatantly abusive in their powers were that kind of thing was deemed illegal back in the 90s whole system needs a change we are just falling behind as a state still living in the past and not thinking ahead. State has grown too quick and the politics are still thinking and acting as if it was 20 years ago also we are too conservative as a state. How come I can now get a beer from the Iga in other states but can't do it here unless the bottle shown owns a pub and we need daylight savings. Also they have bypassed every town from the border to Sydney except Coffs Harbour in the last 25 years but it takes us 4 years to do some roadworks at spiringwood Ssomeone needs to grow a pair and push our state forward. I would be happy to do it lol but I'm not a political mind.
66. I think a lot of the people asking why would have learned a lot more going into the election if they spent more time listening to people rather than condemning people do didn't vote their way, scaremongering about issues like abortion or being fanboys and girls for SMiles.
67. Get off reddit and touch some grass. Then you will know how.
68. 3M in the city. 2000 in a regional area. Both places vote to put a blue guy in charge. City guy wins by 10000 votes. Regional guy wins by a couple of hundred. It’s not popularity, it’s proportional representation. (Figures for illustration only).
69. "Democracy means government of the people, by the people, for the people. But the people are retarded."
70. The fact there are still people in r/brisbane who claim that youth crime was/is a beat up just goes to show how out of touch with reality they are. The [figures](https://www.qgso.qld.gov.au/statistics/theme/crime-justice/crime-justice-statistics/recorded-crime) speak for themselves. At best it can be explained by people swallowing the 'But look, *offender* numbers are down' propaganda whilst totally ignoring that the number of *offences* is up.
71. If there is any key factor, it's the greying of Australia - the olds won this election cycle.
72. 50 cent fares: Greater Brisbane: Yay! Regional Queensland: ummm, can we have a bus?
73. That's fine, but if you look at the massive swings in the Brisbane area toward LNP, it's not just a regional thing
74. Or even just the outer suburbs of Brisbane apparently. I love being an inner city lefty but fuck some of us can really be out of touch sometimes.
75. >people outside of Brisbane People outside of ~~Brisbane~~ reddit FTFY
76. Or even just spent too much time in this sub, which is a 95% labor/greens echo chamber.
77. Or they're rusted on inside a dark green sensory deprivation thought bubble
78. 100% this, Labor voter myself but honestly understand the amnesty towards the LNP from northern and regional areas.
79. Even in Brisbane, the ABC results are showing really significant swings away from the ALP. 15% in Inala is huge. Not enough to lose their seat, but if you're losing that much in a safe seat you do need to be engaging with people more.
80. You can't even get them to fluoridate their water. Fear and anger are all they understand
81. Agreed. Wallowing in their sorrows is not the way to handle this. Labor needs to go back to the Whitlam days and get back to their roots to win back the regions.
82. I don't think they'll need a plan. Just let the LNP be the LNP for 3 years like last time.
83. People who have been historically subjugated are **not** in an echo chamber. We've lived with the oppressor's worldview imposed on us for what, a few millennia now? We're not the ones with our heads in the sand, denying reality.
84. I don't think the ABC appeals to a swing voter either....
85. I don't think it appeals to *anyone*, it's just that some people hate watch it. My dad needs his fix of being angry at a nebulous enemy like "immigrants" and "youth crime".
86. Bingo. Don't whine from the sidelines - go out and make the change happen
87. While helping locals is a great cause, the OP is saying that it's the regional areas that are the concern. Helping a local member will not help sway regional voters, and short of donating hundreds of thousands of dollars towards marketing for regional areas, there's not a lot Brisbane locals can do. OP is expressing concern at the influence of media in regional areas (which is 100% valid, I know from my boomer farmer parents).
88. >You need to let it go and move on. Hey, This post opened my eyes to what should be seen as a HUGE issue! So I thank OP for posting it. Diverse media is important, but one way to look at it and why we should be whining online, contacting our local members, signing parliamentary petitions, etc) is the ongoing impact of a 2 system local news. If the only local jobs within news/journalism/media etc in the regions are 2 options, and you basically have to pick a side, so then you get journalism that is skewed to whoever is going to approve of your writing and give you a job. If your popular local radio/podcast/news is produced by less people, then you are flooded with language which leads you to believe certain things. This is NOT good. Lots of people have issues with the ABC too (although why, in comparison, I don't know) listeners/watchers in the regions, so where else do you go? Sky. That's all you've got. It is concerning, because the regions tradionally vote for the Nationals, and feeding them questionable opinions branded as "journalism" leads to people in Parliament with questionable opinions. That's how we got Pauline Hanson. I personally gained insight, and after reading the article and re-reading the post, I understood what OP meant.
89. The OP Posting ALP talking points on this sub is this guys whole life. I was hoping he would delete his short term account he created for the election and disappear. Alas the post election tears seem to be continuing so my time here will be short lived.
90. This is and always will be stupid logic
91. Yep. The amount of people calling the voters wrong on reddit and other forums has been staggering. One essential rule of democracy is that the voters never get it wrong
92. I really hate the assumption from so many people on this sub that their views are “correct” and everyone else is wrong. I am not a conservative, and I didn’t vote LNP. But it’s also anyone’s prerogative to vote how they see is best aligned with their own views. I don’t think we need to go down the path of American politics where everything becomes about politics and entrenched views and neither side can see eye to eye.
93. Yes we get that. The next step is understanding why voters decided the way they did.
94. Media is a monopoly market though....
95. This. The number of redditors I saw on here last week saying the Libs are lying about crime should try living in Townsville
96. Murdoch controls the media in the regions. Regional Qld can access sky for free and get the courier mail. Everyone else has been killed off and the regions often complain about not having local news anymore. Well, stop voting conservative then so your national broadcaster can get finding back to go to the regions
