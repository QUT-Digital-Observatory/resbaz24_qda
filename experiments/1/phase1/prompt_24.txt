Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. It was a criminal offence if you didn‚Äôt get a doctors approval, but basically everyone got a doctors approval, it was so easy. Many women I know have had one prior to 2018. The law change was just aligning the statute with what was already happening and had been going on for a long time. The laws were already interpreted pretty broadly and protected at common law, so you‚Äôd have to have done something really dodgy to be actually criminally charged in 2018.
2. A bit hypocritical when you all voted the LNP deal with it and don‚Äôt block traffic
3. Health workers, not 'professionals' and 2754. And 1217 of those were from head corporate head office (source Brisbane Times) Source https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-10-29/fact-check-queensland-health-workers-cuts/12819864 You can stop the misinformation now, the election is over, and you're generally preaching to echo chamber here and therefore not influencing anything anyway.
4. Exactly. If a baby has anencephaly, non-survivable heart defects, non-survivable genetic defects etc. which mean it will die as soon as it is born, parents are advised to terminate early. It is extremely traumatic for women (and their partners) to expect them to continue with the rest of the pregnancy knowing they will deliver a baby that will die. This is still classed as ‚Äúabortion‚Äù. My cousin‚Äôs wife was carrying a baby with anencephaly (the baby had no brain and would only survive in utero - once born it would die) and they had to terminate at 20 weeks. Carrying another 20 weeks would have been hell for them. It‚Äôs traumatic enough finding out your baby has an abnormality like that and is going to die, no matter what. Imagine what that would be like. Put yourself in those shoes. This is a perfect example of why we cannot have the abortion laws changed!
5. Often not actually
6. Xenophobia as a retort is... An interesting direction. Go on, continue to hold fucking signs up, it does so much.
7. This you are not forced to accept a child but you arnt allowed to kill them
8. But killing a pregnant woman and causing a babies death is considered a double homicide.
9. Yep. But the campaign labor ran in progressive seats was ‚Äòlabor is the only party that will save abortion rights‚Äô. I was intending to point out that I hope to see all Labor campaigners, ex and current MPs and members at protests if these rights are under attack. I don‚Äôt often see labor supporters and elected reps at protests (other than possibly a couple of affiliated union protests) and I‚Äôm pretty skeptical of their genuine willingness to fight for these rights. I tend to vote Greens myself because I like that the Greens walk the talk.
10. It's a pretty standard procedure for abortion to remain legal in cases of rape, incest and or where it may cause harm to the pregnant mother deemed necessary by a doctor....
11. it's against the rules to be abusive. just stating the obvious, if you don't want to have an abortion. use protection.. obviously it doesn't apply in all scenarios, like sexual assault.
12. It's obviously a human who can live by then. I'd say 12 weeks max
13. I am a thoughtcriminal
14. I think they've realised they killed their child.
15. abortion gets babies to god faster, you loons should be happy.
16. MAGA means make america great again
17. I agree 100%. I call the revocation of abortion rights "American insanity". I still don't get why you think protesting would convince the LNP to not touch them. I'd be very willing to join - this is a cause I deeply believe in, but I'd have to be convinced that there's a reason for the LNP to care about these protests.
18. [deleted]
19. Most medical conditions if serious enough would result in spontaneous miscarriage. Sometimes medical professionals are wrong too. Plenty of mothers told their babies would be born with XY OR Z condition and wouldn‚Äôt survive yet were born perfectly healthy. My sister was one of those people!
20. Exactly! Women aren't doing it as birth control and the Government isn't changing the laws.
21. Some are addicted to infanticide
22. Not no one. My ex's best friend had 6 abortions by the time she was 19.
23. So it's the guy's fault typical. 81% of women are on contraception, that's good, its only the other 19% that are the issue then. get everyone in that age group to use the pill and condoms bingo the problems solved. How about you start a rally to promote safe sex? it takes two to tango. when did human life become so insignificant?
24. I dont think you have any to spare
25. üôå In states in the US where abortion laws have been rolled back, women have been dying from refusal of care or medical gaslighting when they present to the emergency department with an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy is where the embryo implants outside of the uterus, usually in the fallopian tubes, but sometimes in the abdomen. To save her life, the growing embryo must be removed and usually the fallopian tube too. Because they fear legal ramifications, doctors and hospitals are refusing women treatment or gaslighting women and saying they don‚Äôt have an ectopic and discharging them, resulting in their death. There have been so many cases! There is a very real threat of this happening in Qld if the laws are repealed!
26. You don‚Äôt believe women when they say they have been raped? What‚Äôs the matter with you?
27. Abstinence
28. Who cares what that hillbilly wants? LNP got a majority govt so won‚Äôt need to do a deal with the Katters thankfully because I have no doubt he would‚Äôve come up with some inbred idea
29. Killing off free speech is a dangerous game. If you manage to get it through and another party decides to exploit it for their own personal gain and potentially even the benefit of their corporate donors, that would result in much greater damage than a bunch of cookers publicly declaring their ignorance
30. This is exactly why we are having the problems we are now. Because if stupid comments like that. You better love freedom of speech with everything you got because you can't even go on Facebook and call someone stupid without a 30 day ban. So imagine a prison sentence because someone didn't like you calling them a "jerk" or "stupid". You really need to educate yourself before you share any sense of your political opinion.
31. Your suspicions would be incorrect. There are well established guidelines and protocols for life-sustaining measures and their withdrawal. If there is an ethical concern, or disagreement about best medical practice it is deferred to the courts anyway. With this legislation, it is never clear enough to outline all of the possible scenarios that might arise. For example, if it is a criminal offence to not provide life-sustaining measures for a baby that will only ever survive on a ventilator, that might lead to babies being put through needless and prolonged suffering so that the treating team can clarify if they are going to be criminalised for something that would otherwise be a medical and ethical decision. You're holding up best practice, so that doctors can waste their time making sure they won't get criminalised under a nonsense piece of legislation. What about a baby that could survive with dialysis for just 48 hours longer? Do you prolong their life to give that treatment until they succumb under this law, even though that 48 hours would probably have been better spent comforting them and giving them time with their parents who just want to hold and love them. If there is nothing 'wrong' with a baby "born alive", it is already illegal and medically negligent to let them die. The law does not make anything clearer, it creates another layer of complexity on top of the well established medical and ethical standards, of which is there is disagreement over - already has a process in place to come to a resolution.
32. If they‚Äôre doing it anyway then why does it need to be legislated? What‚Äôs the motive for the people bringing this to the table?
33. Because a) abortions are carried out before the age of viability, so no birth before 22 weeks will survive b) if there is an abortion after this stage it would be an induction of a baby that has a condition that is not compatible with life anyway. These babies often are born breathing, legislating a doctor to provide ‚Äòlifesaving care‚Äô is removing time parents might have had with their dying child to implement care that is traumatic and unnecessary. C) do people really think viable babies are being born and a doctor just watches them gasp for air when they could help, and just choose not to? And D) ‚Äòfailed abortion‚Äô Is a thing that happens so rarely it‚Äôs not even worth discussing. It‚Äôs a fantasy. Nobody in favour of this bill has offered any statistics or data to support their position.
34. This type of legislation is an anti-abortion bill that grossly misrepresents later abortions. It‚Äôs a copy of activism/legislation from a US group called Live Action and in Australia it‚Äôs championed almost exclusively by people who oppose all abortion - Joanna Howe, Australian Christian Lobby, Right to Life Australia, Cherish Life QLD. The vast majority of medical groups don‚Äôt support this bill or the federal one that had a senate hearing last year. This article explains why it‚Äôs very problematic: https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/aug/28/australian-conservatives-claim-babies-are-sometimes-born-alive-after-an-abortion-whats-the-truth
35. What is the source of that description?
36. That information is incorrect. Any baby born alive legally has to be cared for as a person with full rights. However if the abortion is done because the fetus is not viable, and it is born alive, best care may be to simply keep it comfortable while it dies.
37. it is a direct copy of an american bill and you‚Äôd have to be a fucking idiot to believe it. a if there is a baby alive outside of its mother that is just a fucking human that is required to be provided care like any other. that doesn‚Äôt happen because people aren‚Äôt just having abortions for fun with viable third trimester pregnancies, but even if it did it is clearly covered by the law. >seeks to legislate care for infants who survive abortion procedures. Under current Queensland law, there‚Äôs no obligation for healthcare practitioners to provide life-sustaining care to such babies if they are deemed unwanted. like how fuckin stupid are you? there‚Äôs no obligation? yeah there is. the same one that applies to all humans. >This legislative gap has led to cases where babies born alive after failed abortions were reportedly left without medical intervention. yeah you‚Äôre smoking some good shit now >Katter‚Äôs bill would mandate that any baby born alive, regardless of the circumstances, receives medical treatment comparable to any other newborn. which literally is already law.
38. Shhh, stop stating facts to reddit lefties.....
39. Someone gets an abortion, but the baby is breathing when it comes out of its mother. Currently, that baby is left to die. This law doesn't want that. I would want a personal discussion with someone who would walk away from that living baby.
40. They have a majority of just one... It doesnt take much panic in an LNP member with a tiny margin to crack and cross the floor...
41. Given they repeatedly said they wouldn't do it, it seems like they have a reverse mandate. "We said we wouldn't do it, we won, hence the people don't want us to do it".
42. Well yeah, under crapitalism all working class freedom is under constant threat of removal. If that's what you mean.
43. My guess is that Labor‚Äôs reddit misinformation team got paid until the end of the month.
44. Sure if you want to take it to the nth degree I suppose if it was a possibility we should also pre-emptively protest to stop that. Let's see what the LNP do, the new coal mines won't mine themselves.
45. > Oh, don‚Äôt forget to march against taking the vote off women Yeah if David Crisafulli had voted against an act codifying the right of women to vote in the past few years, I think that would definitely be fair enough.
46. No but until the immediate threat of criminalisation of abortion has passed by (i.e. this first couple of months especially) we need to raise our voice to remind the government that we won‚Äôt accept any changes. Then if they go to criminalise it (or restrict access) THEN we disrupt. The point of disruptions and strikes is that it hurts the politicians most. Voters are pissed off, cbd economy slows temporarily, it costs the state. And so it should if it means we can protect a woman‚Äôs healthcare and rights.
47. Exactly. "plans change" "Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth" Etc.. take your pick. Call me wild but I don't trust politicians.
48. Given we know how they voted in 2018, We can be sure that if the bill is tabled abortions will become illegal. [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/17/queensland-parliament-votes-to-legalise-abortion) You can't trust the LNP in any capacity on what they say but people eat it up constantly.
49. The LNP can stop the bill being tabled. As the party in power, they control Parliament and can make it difficult for Katter to even get a vote started on the bill. Other ways are to vote to send it to a committee for discussion, to report back to Parliament in 3 years time.
50. Wrong. They explicitly ruled it out, after the scare campaign had gained momentum. You just weren't paying attention, obviously. https://youtu.be/sP2b1tB4-5U?si=d0AAgRcyO-28K0Hk 0:37 is the timestamp, if you're lazy.
51. Choosing the lesser of two evils is still choosing evil. Your ‚Äútactical‚Äù voting is actually the least tactical way to vote possible. If everyone who does what you do stopped then the votes would stop flowing to liberal or labour. Vote for third parties instead of the major. Every. Single. Time. Nothing will change with your ‚Äútactical‚Äù voting because the minor parties will never win enough votes to gain independence from the major parties. If we start regularly voting for minor parties they‚Äôll go ‚Äúhey, we have an even playing field against these major parties‚Äù and the votes will stop flowing to the major parties. On top of that by voting minor first a lot of members of the major party will leave and join minor parties they better align with.
52. Still better than voting for the two major parties. Notice how I also said vote for the greens? They‚Äôre complete opposite ends of the spectrum. Idgaf who you choose as long as it‚Äôs not ALP or LNP. Maybe try using your fucking brain instead of slapping the keyboard like a monkey
53. Ahh yes. I‚Äôm the stupid one for saying that we need change. Get a fucking brain bozo. You‚Äôre unironically a bootlicking sheep. All you do is vote based off emotional connection to a party. They are OBJECTIVELY both fucking horrible parties. Idk how all you are so stupid you don‚Äôt realise it but ffs no wonder this country is becoming a shit hole
54. I was only sticking to bottled water and soft drinks, but thanks for the idea.
55. What the fuck is wrong with you? You've been given all the relevant info from healthcare professionals. But you refuse to read it or accept that your first impression was vastly incorrect. You must be the most intelligent cunt in the country in your mind. Fucking embarrassing ego on display by you people!
56. Not as different as you‚Äôre claiming. We have actual Trumpists in this country. Seriously, I‚Äôve unfriended many on Facebook because the delusion is that real. Sky News is on free to air in regional Australia for a reason. The LNP has been down this road before. They stick a Liberal figurehead at the front of a Nationals ship. For decades LGBT people were told ‚Äúyou can have civil unions, just don‚Äôt call it marriage‚Äù, so we did that, and then in the very first week of Campbell Newman‚Äôs government they said ‚Äúnah, it‚Äôs too much like marriage, so we‚Äôre going to change them to ‚Äòregistered relationships‚Äô and you can‚Äôt have a ceremony and it‚Äôs not recognised anywhere else.‚Äù The first fucking week as if it was the most important issue they had. So yeah, call me fucking jaded at these lying religious cunts. But you‚Äôll be right, your bank balance will continue to go up because that‚Äôs all that matters.
57. Stay complacent at your own risk.
58. You know Labor was preferencing KAP right?
59. Righto. But if it doesn't you have to eat the whole fence. No sauce or salt. Just sit and chomp.
60. Remind me! 6 months
61. They have absolutely not been making our quality of living better over the last 10 years. Maybe in Brisbane but out in the rest of the state is is objectively worsening. Also nice strawman dumbass. When did I blame them for supply shortages, national interest rates and climate problems? Fucking hell you people are dumb. Rural Queensland is collapsing and Labour have done NOTHING about it for DECADES and those are facts. Do you know who decides the next state government? It‚Äôs not the goldcoast and Brisbane. It‚Äôs the rest of Queensland. So yes. Labour IS to blame for neglecting rural Queensland. Labour have done such a fucking horrible job that they got themselves kicked out after despite being in power for 90% of the last 35 years. If they had ACTUALLY done well they would have been talking about how great their track record is instead of just pointing and saying LNP is worse. If labour had ACTUALLY been doing a good job they would have been voted back in. Labour came THIRD. More people voted for the greens than for labour. If that isn‚Äôt proof enough that people have no faith in labour anymore you‚Äôre just fucking stupid.
62. interesting how if you look up reasons for abortions what your saying is actually part of the minority of reasons why people abort.
63. its interesting how i said nothing about that but your pushing that idea as if its the main reason people abort their child, when statistically its not. I am in agreement that you should abort if the child hasnt formed properly/rape/life of the mother. Im not in agreement that if you want careless sex then maybe you will have consequences. Its never been an easier time to avoid pregnancies, so do that avoid being pregnant dont just kill the thing you have created because you dont want responsibilities
64. yeah they had so many choices they could have made before the point of needing an abortion.
65. [deleted]
66. They are stating that they believe abortion should not be allowed to be another form of birth control and should not be acceptable in instances where a child is conceived because two consenting adults wanted to have fun. Don't shoot the messenger. I didn't get it at first until I remembered my euphemisms
67. [deleted]
68. Ahhh, so we should all relax and assume that the Christian Nationalists won't do what they believe their God wants them to do. I am not relaxed.
69. I mean tbf he‚Äôs said a lot of things and then backtracked. It‚Äôs not like he doesn‚Äôt have a track record of this.
70. What he's said is it isn't in his "plan". I haven't heard him rule out a conscience vote on KAP's proposed bill, which they have promised to introduce.
71. Oh thank fuck, the politician said so, it must be true.
72. he already went back on his word that he was going to quit over youth crime numbers
73. 1.I don't know if you know this, but politicians don't always stick to their promises. 2. You need to read up on history and the power of protests.
74. Remindme! 3 months
75. Yeah Its unlikely he won't change given how they have voted in the past, if the KAP put up the privates member bill we know it will pass as planned afterall they voted against it in 2018 apart from 3 LNP politicians who had the common sense to vote against the party. [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/17/queensland-parliament-votes-to-legalise-abortion) Just Delusional that people actually trust this fella in any capacity or in general the LNP after they are known to lie and take back there word constantly.
76. he said HE had no plans to change it. When Katter introduces his bill, he will not direct his party to vote against it. which is effectively given it a pass.
77. Comment respectfully. Continued harassment may result in you being banned.
78. Yep, father of two, if my wife or daughter ever needed access to healthcare and was denied by the Government for "reasons", I'd go postal.
79. zealot implies they are acting on what their faith teaches. Christianity contains nothing against the termination of a fetus. The religion has been co-opted to serve the wants of the wealthy few many times in history and still is today
80. I mean... Changing abortion rights is a big deal. It's a very justified reason to be angry and passionate. Thing is it's still very up in the air what will happen, which obviously means fear and uncertainty. It's understandable, people like having rights.
81. Fear of losing bodily autonomy isn't quite as simple as brushing it off and moving on.
82. This is the first time I‚Äôve seen that both options have such radically different outcomes. Labour has provided a lot of real improvements for the life of everyday Queenslanders. Whereas it sounds like the only thing LNP has committed to it locking up children, firing doctors/teachers, allowing property developers to donate money (bribe) the government and give more money to mining companies. Now they‚Äôre probably going to ban abortion‚Ä¶
83. we are not. however there are a few topics where people get very invested and heated. Abortion access is one of them. it took a HELL of a long time for abortion to be decriminalized and for access to become available. going back to the dark ages is not acceptable.
84. It‚Äôs insane. I‚Äôve been in Aus 2 years now‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs literally part of people‚Äôs personality it seems. Not something I thought would happen moving here. It‚Äôs America Lite.
85. People have too much access to social media , half of them think the next prime minister is Trump or Harris. It‚Äôs people trying to use merrica style politics in Australia.
86. Yeah us trueblue aussies don't give a fuck about politics üòéüòéüòé
87. If it was going to be illegal I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd somehow need to prove you‚Äôve been raped ‚Ä¶ And what‚Äôs the other % of abortions. Medical conditions?
88. Sorry mate I‚Äôve got an antivax mother and I know for a fact they didn‚Äôt force anyone to do anything that they didn‚Äôt begrudgingly consent to. But keep playing victim I‚Äôm sure one of these times it will work on someone.
89. Yes thank you. Let me kill my unwanted babies in peace :)
90. Very entitled to think that a strangers medical choice is your business
91. All but 3 voted against decriminalising abortion last time, so I wouldn't be too confident about that. As for the rest of your comment, okay I guess?
92. You‚Äôre right they won‚Äôt be random babies because abortion is still legal and they will be able to access health care to terminate unwanted pregnancies
93. Do you really want me to quote all the times in history a politician said they won't do something, then proceed to do it? As for the protest time , it's 6pm ? Most of the traffic should've left by then
94. Are you high?
95. Frankly the only way it WON'T happen is if enough people make noise about it and let them know it is unacceptable. 90% of them including Crisafulli prefer abortion being illegal. If they thought they could sneak it through without anyone noticing they absolutely would.
96. Especially the major parties
97. These people have no idea about the laws or what actually happened in 2018. I knew of women who easily got multiple abortions even in the 80s and 90s no questions asked by the doctor, they just did it.
98. When they decide to back track. What's more important than defending women's rights to body autonomy on a Friday night?
99. [deleted]
100. Another friend had to terminate after non-survivable defects were detected on a 24 week ultrasound.
101. Cool, no evidence.
102. You won't see me at the protests because I don't believe that LNP will care about any protests against violating bodily autonomy. If you convince me that they somehow will, I'll go For context, I voted for Labor thIs time
103. [removed]
104. Nah.
105. Not a Christian bludski you just worry about making sure your steam deck works little fella
106. Yeah, and yet MAGA might be applied here despite this not being America
107. It shows the politicians the temperature of an issue in the public. Australians in general do not like to protest. If enough people are motivated to protest about an issue then it usually flows back to being a lot that people care about that issue but couldn't get to a protest for one reason or another. If no one is protesting then it shows it's not an important issue, in their eyes. It's like the tip of an iceberg. Campbell Newman's Titanic MASSIVE majority was sunk by a relatively small iceberg (Public Service cuts), this issue impacts 50% of the population, which is a much bigger iceberg.
108. What the fuck are you on. Abortion isn't murder.
