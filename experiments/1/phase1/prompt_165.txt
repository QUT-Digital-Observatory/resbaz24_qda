Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Youth crime in Townsville is a problem that has been ongoing for years and on the rise with little to no action from the ALP. It’s an issue that has been ignored and swept under the rug while community anger has continued to grow. The only time I’ve seen them make any kind of move in this space was when a woman in Brisbane was killed by a stolen car, ignoring the deaths we’ve had up this way. Look around Townsville pre-election and you’ll see two types of signs. LNP “Adult Crime, Adult Time” signs and KAP “Castle Law” signs. They clearly know what the community sentiment is, and it’s an area the ALP have been caught short on by trying to refer to statewide statistics. If the ALP were serious about reducing crime up this way why didn’t they campaign on the issue on their terms (committing to dropping crime rates through social programs)? They’ve had 9 years in office and still are unwilling to acknowledge there is a problem. >I agree it is an issue. You’ll find many from SEQ don’t agree it’s an issue, because the entire state trend is going down (ignoring differing regional trends). >Hope you feel great about 12 year olda going to jail on adult sentences, setting them up for a life as a hardened criminal. No one should feel great about locking up kids. But people have the right to feel safe in their own home.
2. >Categories: Metropolitan Brisbane, North Brisbane, South Brisbane You really skipped right over the second paragraph didn’t you?
3. Which means Peter Dutton must be right about everything? Impeccable logic!
4. Thank you for being reasonable and sensitive about these topics. I doubt we will agree but here is why I have my perspective on this: The issue I have is some people are strongly anti religious to the point where they want religion out of politics (and to a large extent I agree, perhaps surprisingly, because there are so many religions); but this bleeds into a belief in religious conscience having no place in medicine; things like the pointless and spiteful takeover of Calvary Hospital in the ACT. Secular humanism isn't what I have an issue with. It is the spiteful, almost gleeful anti-religious sentiment. It's as awful as misguided religious people attributing misfortune to God's wrath. Sometimes the atheism here on Reddit seems very committed. Here is a recent discussion on the doctor's own website. [https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/health-bodies-call-for-end-to-regressive-qld-abort](https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/health-bodies-call-for-end-to-regressive-qld-abort) I cannot personally reconcile autonomy as an argument for abortion rights but then declaring that doctors should not be afforded the same bodily autonomy. The fact that it isn't current statute law almost doesn't matter as the issue could be undemocratically decided for us through regulation and licensing.
5. I was involved in running a huge town hall about the issue with nuclear advocates and opposers. I know what I'm talking about.
6. NOOOOOO! I’ve been downdooted! Quick people, nice feelings and hugs can replace 47% of electricity demand in just 62 months! More updoots will power the 55% of total energy provided by liquid fuels! If we really updoot hard enough, we can 30 x solar energy output! Buy that Reddit gold and award harder, Kings! 👑
7. He has to satisfy your a priori axioms you can change at any time with empirical evidence? That’s not how elections work your highness!
8. Your evidence for this claim please?
9. If you seriously have to ask that you have not been paying attention or you just purposefully choose to smell roses when they fart
10. Shhh, never made that mistake ever
11. Yep, I always vote 1. Greens 2. Labor. Greens will never win in my electorate, but the vote is still recorded as a vote for the Greens, even though it goes to labor, due to our preferential system. Even in a close seat between Greens and Labor I would vote Greens because we need people in Parliament that can give alternate views. I do actually vote differently if The Animal Justice Party is running. Then it's AJP, Greens, Labor. They only have a couple of reps, but animals have no voice and they are creating awareness that so much legislation that needs to be changed to protect them.
12. You said you prefer the Greens. You have no idea about voting works. Since I think the Greens are a total waste of space, I could only hope that all Greens voters think like you. However, your vote is worth the same as mine, so you should know how to vote. If your preference is Greens then ALP then Liberals/LNP, you should always vote 1. Greens 2. ALP. If the LNP candidate wins, you voted for the loser either way. Let's assume that on first prefs, the LNP comes first, but with 40% of the vote. The combined progressive vote is 60%. Either the ALP or the Greens will win due to preferential voting. Whoever is eliminated first out of those two loses. The Greens win by coming second and the ALP coming third, with the Green being elected on ALP preferences. But you voted for the ALP. The ALP wins by pushing the Greens into third place, and being elected on Greens preferences. This is the outcome you contributed to, by the sounds of it.
13. The UN and ICJ are no longer organisations with credibility. Their unhealthy obsession with Israel is clear. October 7 was beyond evil, but the UN has barely condemned the perpetrators, going as far as providing immunity to UNWRA employees who have been shown to be terrorists, corrupt, antisemitic etc. UNIFIL also failed in its mandate to enforce Resolution 1701 in Lebanon, colluding with Hezbollah. These undemocratic regimes attack Israel with impunity. Iran is funding terror proxies — Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Shia militias in Syria and Iraq and the Houthis in Yemen. THIS CONFLICT IS NOT ABOUT LAND — Gaza was not occupied. Israel is the only democracy in the region, with Arabs, Jews and other ethnicities co-existing with equal rights. Women are treated as equals. I could go on and on. Israel deserves peace — not constant attacks from Jihadi terror groups who want to kill all Jews and create a pan-Arab caliphate led by Iran. Iranians want freedom; Lebanese Christians want freedom — Israel is standing up to Islamist thugs who wish to take the M.E. back to the middle ages. Palestinians need to accept the fact that Israel existed long before Islam came into being. The Arabs colonised Israel in the 700s and consider Jews as ‘dhimmis’ who are inferior. Many Jews in Israel are there as refugees from surrounding M.E. states that threw them out when Israel was recognised in 1948 as a sovereign state. Palestinians could have accepted the partition of the British Mandate but didn’t. They are not victims, they are aggressors. Arabs who accepted the state of Israel and didn’t leave their homes in 1948 live in Israel as equal citizens. The Al Aqsa Mosque is built on top of two Jewish temples on Temple Mount, because Jews are the indigenous inhabitants of that land. They have an ongoing connection to Israel that pre-dates Islam. Israel has tried to negotiate in the past to no avail, making extremely generous offers that were rejected. Gazans voted in Hamas, devoting their billions in aid funds (from UN, UNWRA, Iran, NGOs etc) to create a terrorist dystopia with tunnels under civilian infrastructure, teaching an ideology of hate and martyrdom to every level of their society, especially children. Hamas is a cancer that has destroyed the soul of Gaza. That people in Gaza celebrated on Oct 7 while watching the most depraved crimes against ‘Jews’ who were progressive, liberal kibbutzim who wanted peace with Gazans. There’s more: the ongoing nightmare with the hostages, rockets fired non-stop since Oct 7, the sheer inhumanity of the left toward Israel immediately after Oct 7 — DISGUSTING UNFORGIVEABLE UNACCEPTABLE.

16. “BeCauSE ITs THe RIgHt ThING tO Do” yeah, very fucking convincing. Then why are the greens losing then? You over estimate how much anyone gives a shit about either the CFMEU or the Palestine issue. You bring up the whole idea of a weekend, convenient when labour rights is something everyone cares about BECAUSE, and here’s the kicker, it applies to them. In the grand scheme of things, I care more about putting food on the table and getting a house over my head that I own (sooner rather than later) than I do about the Middle East and denial over the fact that there clearly was an organised crime component to the CFMEU. And that’s something the Greens cannot seem to understand. Systematic, smaller improvements will always win out over sweeping bullshit changes. And that’s why the Greens will always be a smaller, minority party. Because virtue signalling > working to change a system for better isn’t a winning strategy. Prioritising a conflict that’s not even a peripheral issue > any Australian issue isn’t a winning strategy either. So, congrats on being the most ethical losing party, I hope you feel better standing in the corner out of the mainstream ability to be of any importance whatsoever, but I hope it at least feels good to self flagellate yourself with your moral values.
17. Of course people are capable of that. I just don't think the greens are capable of that. You don't see these activists out there protesting against all the other awful shit that's happening in the world.
18. As I said, it's a legitimate position. I think you are very naive about politics, which is why I teased chooks42 about the comic-book level of sophistication. I've sat next to Senator Faruqi at functions which informs my opinion on this. I like her a lot, by the way. The motto at the end of Superman the TV show was "Truth, Justice and the American Way" (what Superman stands for), and it's the first thing I thought of, but I figured chooks42 would be too young to get the reference. Why do I sound like a landlord? Because I make logical arguments that you don't like? I am not a landlord, the good Senator is of course.
19. Some potential issues to consider, particularly on messaging around labor and liberal to not scare off progeessive voters. I'm not sure alI agree with your second point though, as the back-and-forth is the nature of negotiations and has seen some success. Thanks for your reply.
20. Bandt's strategy is to go after niche voting blocks: renters and Muslims, and assuming that the traditional Green voter base is secured. He also has a very factionalised party to manage, with deep divides over population/migration, and traditional feminism/trans rights. It is understandable to rally the party to dramatic policies which don't touch these areas. Hence we have a lot of noise around Palestine and housing. It means they have daft housing policy which is effectively ridiculed by policy experts, and which is forced to ignore a huge part of the problem, migration, because that' a landmine no Greens leader can step on. It;s not working. The Greens are losing more votes than they are winning. The Resolve poll a couple of weeks ago shows that even among the Greens voters who have stayed, not 40% support the housing policy and its central plank of abandoning negative gearing and replacing private investors with state housing, paid for with massive increases in middle and upper middle income taxes. The traditional voter based that his strategy assumes is rusted on is actually middle and upper middle income earners. It is rather crude to suggest there is any connection, of course. But for what ever the reason, millennial Greens voters are leaving (according to RedBridge comments) I don't think renters are as inspired by lifelong renting in government housing as the Greens might think. Based on the lack of buy in to the housing policy that Resolve showed, I doubt the Green vote has hit the bottom. As to the Muslim vote, there is deep suspicion of a party that is so hostile to conservative religious beliefs. It is an unlikely alliance. You notice that Senator Payman considered become a Green for approximately 0 seconds. But Bandt is paid the big bucks, not me.
21. Again, the Greens political strategy can improve, but it's not because they have bad or unpopular policies. You say people don't fall for MSM, but you've apparently fallen for the attacks on Max hook, line and sinker. You said MSM is 'barely holding on' - presumably you mean that not many people get their information from MSM anymore, which is questionable. Mainstream media and social media play off of one another and have porous boundaries - they mostly target different demographics. All of our social media platforms are now flooded with and also responding to/shaped by mainstream media companies. Regarding the 2022 federal election which I assume you're referencing - one maajor factor I believe is that this time around, the Liberal and Labor parties, and lobby groups such as Advance and Qld Jewish Collective (a zionist org) spent considerable resources attacking the Greens in the qld election as they have gained seats and posed more of a threat/shaped discourses more, whereas previously the Greens were mostly ignored. The negative ads percolated through social and mainstream media. Greens could have tried for a stronger social media presence to counteract this messaging. I'm sure there are other points of difference from the previous election but that's not relevant. What's relevant is why you think Greens had more success then and not now, if you think the reason they didn't have success this time is because of their policies? Their policy platform has not significantly changed since 2022. So something is not quite lining up in what you're saying. Since you're so smart and well-informed, maybe you could give some specific policy recommendations - what are some policies you dislike and what would you rather them be? I must say even I'm bored at this point though if this just continues as a bad faith tussle.
22. >The Government makes decisions with their benefactor and it the media's job to sell it to us. What does that even mean? What a strange sentence
23. And I've had a look at South Brisbane. The Greens have a real chance there I think.
24. Who's playing victim? I just disagree with your statement, no victims. Maybe go touch grass for a bit buddy.
25. I respect anyone to have their religion and choices as long as they respect mine. We may not agree, but we can discuss and respect decisions. As long as those decisions don't affect others. Abortion is a sensitive topic as some see that as a life, whereas I don't until such time it is a fully formed human. Yes, life is cruel. I have seen veterinarians in tears because they have to put to sleep animals on a near daily basis, that also cuts me deep. But I also eat steak and chicken. I am not perfect, in God's eyes I am a flawed sinner that will be forgiven.. maybe. In my eyes I see the world as imperfect and I feel comfort in that one day I will die, and I get a sense of comfort it's just over, or I get a feel of exhaustion thinking there is could be some afterlife that may continue on. I would argue those who are atheists are just as religious as someone with a denomination, they just have hate in their heart. Am I religious? No, but I do wonder if there is something more, it's the same curiosity I have if there is life on other planets out there in the universe. Sometimes I think something greater than me is in my life, then I also think it's just how it happens, good or bad. I understand why people attribute misfortune to God's wrath as such, I worked for the Catholic Church for almost 10 years, I was not a Catholic. I saw some pretty terrible stuff happening and senior Catholics saying it's just Gods love in some way and there is a plan. It was hard to accept and if anything, it was this hypocritical crap that steered me away from that religion while a work colleague, similar to me went and got baptized and started going to church on Sunday. What I learn is humanistic common respect is what we need. How people get there is up to them.

28. 🤣
29. Look at the RSPCA scorecard. They gave Greens and AJP the same positive score. I’d be putting AJP second, a single issue party isn’t really effective, but at least you get it.
30. You assume a lot. But most of all how much anyone cares what you think.
31. Or, maybe, just maybe, Israel is doing some horrendous shit and those institutions are doing everything they can to reign them in. Seems fairly obvious to me this conversation is going nowhere. We disagree on very basic facts.
32. You don't seem to be able to get it into your head that we might do things because we believe in them. Why are the greens losing then? Mainly because we're a small party, lacking in power, picking a fight with the media and big corporations who have vested interests in us not winning. The media coverage of the greens is typically insane. I bring up the weekend as an example of the protest and labour movement, which (judging by your take on the CFMEU) you wouldn't get off your ass to support unless it directly benefitted you. It's not like we've been supporting Palestine at the expense of ordinary Australians, we can multitask... Also, there's no denying that there were criminal elements in the CFMEU. If you paid any attention to the debate, the issue is about the government stepping in to shut them down rather than letting the courts follow due process. The CFMEU is the most powerful union in Aus and shutting them down is a betrayal of the Labour movement that the ALP is mean to represent. Systematic small improvements is all that the ALP want you to believe is possible. Substantial issues, like what we have in housing, needs more than tinkering around the edges. 50cent fares was mocked and called radical/farcical until the ALP implemented it. Id prefer to self flagellate with my morals than be bending over for the ALP/NLP, asking for it harder as they do the bare minimum.
33. Too young? You are funny. The Greens consistently stand up for injustice. “Social justice” is one of their four pillars.
