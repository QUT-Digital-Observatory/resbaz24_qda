Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Bart ain’t perfect, and the LNP’s scare campaign billboards made him look like he just got in from a night on the gear (was joking about this with the Labor volunteers) but as Transport minister he’s done OK. 50c fares, smart ticketing, extending the busway on Gympie Road, and negotiating an extension of Metro to Carseldine - not bad. I have less faith in whoever LNP slots into that position.
2. Way to show that you have no idea what you're talking about.
3. He's already backtracked on resigning if youth crime doesn't fall lmao
4. He's just upset about being born at all. Now he wants everyone feel like him. Wtf are men deciding over someone else's family choices anyway?
5. He essentially has four years to do whatever the fuck he wants. I imagine he would have the numbers to recriminalise abortion if it ever came up in parliament.
6. It took all her self control to repeat the part line when interviewed last night
7. Because then they can win more elections in the future running a scare campaign against them. It's a virtuous cycle.
8. Poor fellow, getting a job where you get asked questions all day and then getting pissed when you have to answer them all day. What a muppet.
9. I truly believe the overturning of Roe in the US has given anti abortionists in this country the licence to start discussing it again. They weren't happy when it was decriminalised and remember that was only in 2018. Not that long ago.
10. As a woman I feel devastated that my rights are being discussed. That this is even something that should be up for debate, if I don’t want a child for ANY reason that should be enough not to have one. I feel like if they will take the rights from women then what minority will be next.
11. He doesn't want it. He doesn't care if it lives once it's born. He doesn't care about it's education or whether it eats but by God he wants you to birth it!! He advocates for a separation of Nth Qld from the rest of the state... don't tempt me with a good time.
12. And that's a fine example how making abortion illegal is gonna help increase actual crime ahah Honestly we deserve who we vote in at this point
13. Yup, once again we women aren't actually humans in the eyes of the right wing conservatives, we're simply a thing that exists so people can mess with our rights. I saw that David is "pro-choice" and thinks women have a right to choose, however he thinks late term abortions should be banned??? Sir late term abortions are for when it's a legitimate medical necessity. I said it before and I'll say it again, I think society would be better if we had access to MORE abortions. Why force people to be parents when they clearly don't want it?
14. That thing would be your child. Society is falling.
15. >If I need an abortion and this fuck head stops me I'm giving birth to that thing in his yard and leaving it in the mailbox. No you wont
16. We can! Hurrah.
17. Yeah, no, if the LNP didn't plan to touch abortion old mate would have ruled out a conscience vote instead of refusing to answer the question 130 times. KAP are just their scapegoat Edit: and if focus groups mattered, they wouldn't be doing this over 70% of people in QLD support abortion.
18. > the libs don't need to entertain Katter to get other stuff over the line They won't be able to fully blame KAP now that they have a majority.
19. Pretty sure the LNP have floated cancelling the Olympics. I for one am on board with that. I don't want what happened to Rio to happen to Brisbane.
20. I'm actually of the opinion the LNP won't botch the planning. Big business want the Olympics so I expect they'll be more likely to push for them now that they're in power. Should be interesting to see what they go with. We already know it won't be QSAC (Good)
21. Labor is the reason the Olympics are looking like a shit show with no planning less than a decade out lol
22. Because the ALP have really done a great job planning the Olympics so far...
23. Why change a perfect strategy? Fuck I wish the second 3rd of the country read and understood more about politics..... *Faces palms*
24. Ahh... You might wanna check the Qld gov balance sheet mate.
25. Ummm. The state is already in debt. Labor were literally saying they would need to borrow more money to pay the public service. 🤨
26. >Total General Government Sector borrowings as at 30 June 2024 is forecast to be $62.0 billion [Fiscal strategy and outlook - Queensland Budget 2024-25](https://budget.qld.gov.au/files/Budget_2024-25_BP2_Fiscal_strategy_and_outlook.pdf)
27. You aren't missing anything. The changes the government made in 2022 made coal royalties more progressive and these are the changes the LNP will wind back. We will still have royalties in place. The changes did increase revenue but it was based on adding more tiers depending on the coal price. They previously went up in increments maxing with the highest royalty of 15 percent applying when the coal price is over $150 a tonne. The labor government added some extra tiers to charge 20 percent at 175, 30 percent at 225 and 40 percent at over $300. It can generate a lot of extra revenue but only if the price hits over $175 a tonne. In 2022 and 2023 it absolutely did. Was sitting at over $400 at one point. But in 2024 it's been under $175 and hasn't generated more revenue as a result. So scrapping those changes at this point won't result in any less revenue. But of course if the price goes up it will. I don't think LNP should touch it because the royalty is actually the fairest way to charge for resources. It's not based on profits but rather based on the amount of minerals mined. And it makes sense to charge more when the price is higher.
28. From what I’ve seen/experienced. Those that voted for it probably have enough money/retirement funds for cost of living to not matter to them (- quote basically directly from my dad who did a donkey vote believing his vote doesn’t matter because nothing affects him being a straight white retired male with a retirement fund and super)
29. The worst part is that it will hurt inflation figures too- and the RBA may use that as ammo to _increase_ rates to stop us spending on essentials we can’t stop spending on, rather than hold steady or reduce them. Good work, Queenslanders, this could suck. I hope Crisafulli sticks to his claim that he’ll work for Queensland, but the mining royalty thing alone leases me pessimistic.
30. It breaks my heart :(
31. My contribution to this 6) being homeless is a crime
32. There’s nothing to indicate it does or doesn’t, which is true for a lot of important topics this time round. I do remember a couple of years ago that there were a couple of politicians who tried to run on it at a state and federal level (LNP’s NSW premier at the time and the United Australia Party) and fell flat on their face as a result; I can only hope this government takes a note from that and doesn’t follow suit.
33. hell yeah
34. Sorry meant to say Conscience vote. A conscience vote allows party members to vote according to their own personal conscience rather than their political party’s own decided stance. So even though Crisafulli said LNP will not introduce the policy, a conscience vote allows the party members to vote themselves and they can still claim LNP didn’t introduce it.
35. Yeah I have several friends who work in healthcare and hospitals and my vote was for them. Disappointed to hear that some of my friends may be jobless within the next few weeks despite already being stretched thin on overtime/extra shifts
36. Housing defaults are going to skyrocket. And they will blame Labor or the tooth fairy. Consider that these will be young families and they won't have anywhere to go. A mechanic working 50 hours to pay a $700 pw loan repayment for his family to have somewhere secure. That's what you are about to see.
37. > I think there were only two or three left in parliament. 7 vs 78 or something
38. You’re right I completely forgot about all the corporate lobbying that actually fuels the conservative movement lmao
39. That's correct. I considered the cost of living to be a much more serious issue than youth crime. And unlike the LNP, Labor actually had policies to address that. Crisafulli on the other hand is promising to decimate taxes, including the mining royalties. So there goes 50c public transport fares. There's goes cheaper car rego. There goes energy bill rebates..
40. I agree fully with you. We need targeted interventions, more collaboration between government departments at all levels, and more importantly we need to stop using law enforcement as our only line of defence. Sometimes that might mean the government stepping in and taking kids away from a bad situation - it’s regrettable, and it must not be taken lightly, the focus absolutely must be on the needs of the kids, and it must be so compelling a reason that intervention in a family unit is the only option left, but the reality is that “breaking the cycle” sometimes needs desperate measures. To be 1000% clear, this is not a suggestion that stolen generations is OK, or something to go back to. I’m saying that the government should be blind to everything but the situation - the kids needs come first, full stop. Community groups can - and must - be looped in fully and worked with to make sure that happens. But QPS needs to stop being the first line of defence against shitty situations for kids, because it’s a fast track to recidivism. They’re not equipped to have to handle what are really complex social issues (I’ve worked there, they barely get equipped to handle simple social issues - I have massive respect for people who stay on the job because they want to make things better, it’s too easy to adopt that cynical attitude you guys all probably recognise that brings out the “ACAB” rhetoric, especially with the shitty conditions, public hatred, and poor pay and funding).
41. Definitely agree on your first point. I think all of the swing voters are very tired of being tired of what I would call the woke virtue signalling on the left. They are actually a relatively small left wing group but they make a lot of noise and people who want nothing more to than to be left alone are constantly being shouted down about whatever the current topic is. Most people in the middle category don't give a toss about your race, colour, religion, sexuality etc and they're sick of being told they're bad people for just wanting to live their life in peace. That small group seem to think the answer is just yelling at people louder (literally and figuratively) but it juat turns them off. I think albo found that out with the Voice, the load minority is not indicative of the whole community. I think US about to find this out again as well. As for Qld, I think we get the same old "budget is worse than though" followed by cuts and outsourcing but it won't be as ruthless as Newman. Will be done using natural attrition, no backfilling jobs etc. 4 years time people will probably have had enough again and back in Labor goes imo.
42. This is right. .. but also months away from phones and social media for young criminals. Teach them to make something. Preferably in a natural setting. People need nature. It's where we evolved. Countless studies show parkland reduces crime. Some we can't instantly make parks, getting little crims into rural areas and helping them learn to camp, fix a car, bulls a structure and especially to keep them offline for a few months would be life changing for many of them. We have programs like this but they need a lot more support and judges need to enforce it.
43. Making major policy decisions based on emotional gut reactions is ridiculous. The entire debate has been LNP and right wing media saying youth crime is out of control, Labor pointing out that crime rates have actually decreased, and then LNP replying with “well it *feels* like it’s worse”. The truth is that LNP’s policies won’t actually fix the problem. But that doesn’t matter because they only need to fix the perception that there is a problem. They can point to some kid who gets locked up, and tell people it’s working. Then switch the media cycle to some other invented problem. Made up solutions to made up problems.
44. For starters my own car was broken into with multiple windows smashed just last year and I've had a few other break ins into my garage as well. I'm almost 100% positive it was the kids from the social housing at the end of my street. Still didn't make me silly enough to vote for "adult crime, adult time". The immediate problem was already being addressed. Youth crime is significantly down, not just in QLD but right across the nation. Overwhelming statistical evidence supports this. Even QLD police statistics support this. And I'm sorry but these people are being stupid because they're angry, and no I don't consider myself above them. I'm stupid when I'm angry too. We all are. But they can't see they've been taken for mugs, these populist policies they voted for will not deliver them justice, nor will it result in better outcomes for these kids, quite the opposite actually. What do you think giving a child a permanent criminal conviction when they were 10 years old will do? Eliminate any chance they ever have at positive interactions with the community, they will never get a job when they're older. I'm not targeting any specific group of people, but when I say angry voters are stupid voters I think it's plain ignorant to argue otherwise..
45. > calling people stupid “Can’t have your car stolen if you can’t afford to have a car! Let’s vote LNP!” \*taps forehead\* Sorry mate. They’re stupid.
46. > a belief of the ruling class that a country needs plentiful struggling workers. 3 US states lodged legal cases to restrict access to abortion pills, why? > “This study thus suggests that remote dispensing of abortion drugs by mail, common carrier, and interactive computer service is depressing expected birth rates for teenaged mothers in Plaintiff States, even if other overall birth rates may have been lower than otherwise was projected,” the suit reads on page 190. https://newrepublic.com/post/187326/new-abortion-pill-mifeprisone-lawsuit-teenagers-pregnant
47. I'm not saying they can't be angry, not what I said at all. History just shows that angry voters are stupid voters. It's how we end up with populist governments.
48. Am an example of this. I grew up with a single dad who dealt drugs on a fairly large scale. A lot of the crap from that lifestyle he chose came home. Yet, I graduated high school with decent grades, have worked my butt off ever since leaving school, and am a (mostly) productive member of society - I work full time in a professional business role. What helped me was having decent support at school, proactive interactions from teachers and members of the community, and as an adult, a lot of therapy.
49. You sir, are part of the problem. Argue against overwhelming evidence to the contrary if you must. But I've better things to do 🤷 Like advocating for actual solutions to youth crime, not populist policies that will create more reoffenders than before.
50. >Just because someone is born in poverty and crime doesn't mean they automatically turn into criminals Too bad now, even if they aren't criminals, it's still straight to camp concentrate.
51. And do you populism is the answer to those serious issues? We've had "tough on crime" approaches before. Do you know why we stopped that and changed, because it overwhelmingly didn't work. Until systemic poverty and a cycle of violence and crime being present in these kids lives from a young age the offending will continue. Crisafulli's populist crime policies will not change that, I promise you.
52. Great, someone who actually buys into this shit. 1. Here's a newsflash for you, they're not scared of 'tough on crime laws'. They feel like they have nothing to lose. 2. This isn't a problem any amount of policing will ever solve. Read that again.
53. You should run for labour because you see the bigger picture and don't have your head in your ass!
54. Why would I not be? I'm now going to be living in a state that will be billions of dollars poorer, and will now be completely ineffective at dealing with youth crimes because it won't have the money to pay for the resources needed to address it..
55. Debbie isn't smart because she doesn't understand the link between poverty and crime. She also doesn't understand that children who go to adult prisons become lifelong reoffenders at significantly higher rates than any other demographic. So really what Debbie voted for, was to make the situation worse 🤷
56. Debbie's reaction is normal and justified. Debbie also doesn't understand the relationship between poverty and crime and the best way to reduce crime is to get people out of poverty. Debbie also doesn't understand that a punishment based system doesn't decrease crime but also exasperates the problem and recidivism rates gp up. The only systainble way of reducing crime is looking at the roots, disengaged children and poverty. But most voters aren't taught this in human geography and development in the education system so it goes amiss in their heads.
57. Debbie isn't smart, she's only thinking short term.. kid stole car, kid go to jail. This is just kicking the can down the road. Prison time won't rehabilitate these kids, it will create a bunch of repeat offenders, this is a well known outcome. What's going to happen is the kids will go to prison young with short sentences for theft or property damage or whatever, come out worse, and then guess what? They're ready to have kids of their own, the cycle continues. Proper youth services have been cut because LNP wanted money for something else. Crime rate gets worse. Labor returns to power and has to deal with it. That's my prediction anyway
58. We weren't saying people like Debbie didn't exist. We were saying the amount of Debbie's was being drastically exaggerated by a media empire that has an interest in LNP governments. We were saying that voting for populism isn't going to deliver the justice victims think it will. Children in adult jails? Overwhelmingly proven to be catastrophically bad for long term outcomes. Lifelong convictions for crimes committed as children? Well that eliminates any chance of positive interactions outside of jail because they'll never get a job with a conviction. May as well sentence them to life in jail. You don't get more populist and infective than what the LNP is promising. We've been here before, we already know an approach like the one Crisafulli is going to use ends in worse outcomes for young offenders and communities affected by crime.
59. ACAT help at all?
60. Sympathies from Metro North. Everybody is going to be on tenterhooks here at the RBWH, waiting for the first round of awfulness.
61. The LNP wants to privatise ambulances while the ALP was working to expand and build more hospitals.
62. Want to share with the class which party said they'd cut funding from public services for the last several weeks?
63. Yes, changing it back to the government that completely demolished it and we've been unable to get it back to where it was when they gained office. Check out tenpenny genius over here.
64. Also people lamenting about how poor the health system is now forget that it's mostly been ALP that have been in government. Who do we have to blame for the wait lists and shortage of staff? The LNP haven't had the run of the show.
65. And back to labor fixing the mess
66. Except that’s a matter for the Feds, not the state government.
67. A stable economy didn't stop Newman getting booted in 2015.
68. That's federal, notbstaye. I really wish people would figure outvthec3clevels of government.
69. The Qld economy is slowing the possibility of a rate cut. Labor has not improved that position.
70. ?? This is a federal issue, and I think ur forgetting interest rates were low when lnp was in charge and stayed low. Unfortunately cost of living covid and all of that happened and pushed interest rates housing etc up, and labor has done nothing to address this and no action has been done
71. I'm so angry that I now have to do more work, because the Murdoch media has confused too many Queenslanders...
72. Royalties have actually been a thing under labour. It was the LNP that gave all our dirt away to billionaires for nothing.
73. >I'd rather see small business start thriving again ![gif](giphy|g01ZnwAUvutuK8GIQn|downsized)
74. Queensland is one of the only states with free ambulance services.
75. QLD & Tasmania are the only States where calling an Ambulance is free. The LNP believe, that by charging people to call an Ambulance that will fix ramping. When Newman was in, he cut Arts Funding significantly, then Covid ruined it further. We have a thriving Arts scene in Brisbane & it’s an important part of Brisbanes identity. The LNP will cut coal royalties because it was a promise they made to the coal companies for their hefty donations. They’ve never cared about small business.
76. In Australia, ambulance fees and coverage differ by state and territory. Here is a breakdown of ambulance costs across the country: 1. Queensland: Ambulance services are free for all residents. 2. Tasmania: Ambulance services are also free for residents. 3. Victoria: Residents must either pay for ambulance services or have insurance. Ambulance Victoria offers membership programs for coverage. 4. New South Wales (NSW): Ambulance services are not free. Residents can get coverage through health insurance or subscribe to Ambulance NSW. 5. South Australia: Ambulance services are not free. Residents are encouraged to have insurance, or they can subscribe to a plan with SA Ambulance Service. 6. Western Australia: Residents must pay for ambulance services unless covered by private health insurance or a subscription with St John Ambulance WA. 7. Northern Territory: Ambulance services are not free, and residents can obtain coverage through a St John Ambulance NT subscription or private insurance. 8. Australian Capital Territory (ACT): Ambulance services are not free. Residents are encouraged to have private health insurance that covers ambulance services. Some individuals may qualify for free services, such as pensioners and concession cardholders, but this varies by state and personal circumstances.
77. Brother pollution levels are sky high and we have microplastics in our water and food climate change is absolutely fucking us right now lmao
78. lol you don't even know that other states have different ambulance systems, how ignorant can you get?? Queensland and Tas are the only ones with the free ambulance system.
79. Arts funding becomes tourism and commercial money which becomes tax money which pays for things to make your life better. If you don't care about arts funding, you're just dense and can't be bothered looking past your own nose.
80. Free ambulances is because Queensland operates them as a public service and funds it from general revenue. Free ambulances _aren’t_ everywhere, all but one other state charge fees for ambulance call outs- we’re privileged in that QAS will pay the invoice if another state issues us a bill. People do actually care about arts funding, because with everything being as shit as it is, arts like musicals, exhibitions, etc, can be seen as an almost essential escape. It can also boost tourism - I’ve seen posters for art exhibitions at Auckland Museum (in New Zealand), funded by the Queensland Government to promote Queensland as a place to visit. Royalties already happen - it’s how Labor funded 50c fares and energy bill rebates. LNP have promised they will, as a priority, strip them back to their previous levels if not lower. The LNP also promises that coal-fired is going nowhere. So climate change will absolutely remain a problem - Queensland currently experiences “one in a hundred year” weather events on average- er, every year. And what’s this “small business” shit? You know who’s fucking over small business? Here’s a hint, it ain’t government. It’s BIG business. Basically, everything you’ve said is a lie. I award you no points, and may sky fairy have mercy on your soul.
81. I’m still pissed about the 2013 election, but the 2016 one pissed me off even more. Abbott shat the bed with the 2014 budget, gave Prince Philip a knighthood, ate an onion and then did creepy shit and got knifed because he was deeply unpopular, Turnbull comes in and gives some snake oil spokesman spiel about building a smart economy (whatever the fuck that is) and people lap it up and completely forget that the Abbott mess was the *exact same government*.
82. > whatever the fuck you want to call all of the gold coast. Rich cunts who want to see their $4 million properties increase in value quickly before sea levels rise and make the entire region a water park.
83. 1. Join. 2. Become active within the party to drive good policy. 3. Become active in your community to drive good policy. 4. Remember, there's a federal election within a year, and that will impact everyone's lives a lot more than what happened last night.
84. Amazing how labour can cause an international cost of living and housing crisis! Such a powerful party.
85. you're telling me the guy who got his political start as a journalism major and then a media advisor in the Howard government, lifelong bureaucrat is........ Going to stop using consultants... hahahahahahahah Oh wait, you're serious?......
