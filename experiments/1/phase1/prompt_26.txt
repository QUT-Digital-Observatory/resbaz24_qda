Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Maybe if you try really really hard you can get some education in medicine and figure it out! Don‚Äôt hurt yourself trying to figure it out though.
2. So no drugs, just delusional.
3. Because the people that will show up are perpetually online crazies that don't work
4. I'm just going to leave this here... hypocrite. üòÇ https://preview.redd.it/k51y7ms70exd1.png?width=659&format=png&auto=webp&s=44878d9d192c53d46928decbb3b5da69efac4190
5. The less people born the better i reckon.
6. A woman should be able to abort a fetus. Maybe if your mind had been given time to develope, you would have realised that too but aye, you're a child. Go back to posting on the wings of fire subreddit.
7. Loving your statistics and lack of actually reading anything I write regarding women‚Äôs medical health. Grow up.
8. I feel so sorry for you that you think people are actually murdering children üíÄdid Jesus rot your brain
9. You really think you did something there? Lol.
10. Sue? It‚Äôs not a civil tort it‚Äôs criminal
11. [deleted]
12. Which is more horrific: keeping doomed babies alive, or aborting perfectly healthy babies?
13. You're saying you have data to back up those claims, "these abortions aren‚Äôt change of mind abortions" I mean some are, like chromosomal disorders etc, As for "these have to happen to save mothers" Then they will happen... You cannot just claim "Oh the doctor will have to care for the baby if it survives so the doctor will now fear to do an abortion", They only get prosecuted if they have a living baby in front of them and don't care for it but instead just refuse to provide it healthcare, This is no different that any other expectation within the medical field, you know first do no harm.... You're literally fear mongering based off nothing more than journalists hyperbolic propaganda engineered to incite emotion so that you continue to share that link and visit the page as that is their business model. lmao can you provide any literature for you wild claims?
14. This is the first time I've read anyone going through the real issues in an Australian forum. Refreshing. I mostly see people chanting meaningless slogans. I hope any future projects and engagements are filled with real issues and honest discussions of ethics and the impact on the women, doctors, foetus,and potential fathers. Particularly, I'm not excited by assertions from uninvolved people. Whenever you hear something really dumb and strongly worded, it's from a spectator. I'm a bit of a spectator myself, so I want to hear from involved and affected people. Thanks for some data. It's along the lines of what I heard from American sources. I'd love to hear from Canada and the UK.
15. Yes. Because a) abortions are carried out before the age of viability, so no birth before 22 weeks will survive b) if there is an abortion after this stage it would be an induction of a baby that has a condition that is not compatible with life anyway. These babies often are born breathing, legislating a doctor to provide ‚Äòlifesaving care‚Äô is removing time parents might have had with their dying child to implement care that is traumatic and unnecessary. C) do people really think viable babies are being born and a doctor just watches them gasp for air when they could help, and just choose not to? And D) ‚Äòfailed abortion‚Äô Is a thing that happens so rarely it‚Äôs not even worth discussing. It‚Äôs a fantasy. Nobody in favour of this bill has offered any statistics or data to support their position.
16. Can you say eugenics
17. Basically. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúour‚Äù plan to put it to the vote, but if it does go anyway, plausible deniability.
18. I believe that‚Äôs because they didn‚Äôt access care through a doctor but rather ordered a medical abortion drug online. If I recall correctly the charge didn‚Äôt stick. Even when they tried to charge surgeons in the 70‚Äôs for doing abortions it didn‚Äôt stick. That moral legislation wasn‚Äôt really a barrier to care. I agree completely that the legislation shouldn‚Äôt change but all this fear mongering about Katter wanting to repeal the legislation isn‚Äôt warranted.
19. I wasn‚Äôt being disingenuous. I also worked in histopath in 2010‚Äôs in QLD and we got heaps ie maybe 30 D&C specimens each day. It definitely didn‚Äôt seem like some extremely old and rarely enforced legislation was preventing women‚Äôs access to care. I don‚Äôt want legislation to change but I do think QLD‚Äôs previous approach to abortion is being intentionally misrepresented by some.
20. Abortions were being performed for decades prior to 2018 with no criminal penalties. The decriminalisation was a hangover from an extremely old law that effectively wasn‚Äôt being enforced.
21. Green, just doubled yourself down on your stupidity. Go buy some more multi coloured hair dye and continue to only get political advice from your friend group.
22. [deleted]
23. Condoms, used correctly are 98% effective. Taking into consideration human error, they're 87% effective. The pill is 99% effective, but drops to 93% when adjusted for errors. This can be as simple as forgetting a pill, or vomiting, or diarrhoea. So, now you have those stats, what do you say about those who is use birth control, but still end up with a pregnancy? Unwanted children are unwanted children. Forcing birth creates all sorts of social and economic issues, not to mention mental health issues. Increases in PPD etc. I'll take having the freedom to choose over being forced to birth. If you don't agree, then you can keep YOUR baby, but you can't force me to keep mine.
24. I understand you have the benefit of knowledge of both systems. I'm not sure how much American style politics is seeping into Australia, but hopefully it can stay at a minimum. But imo, and I could be wrong, this is just anecdotal: religion is not as big a factor in Australian politics as the States. You're right, I didn't think about them trying to get everything done in one term. It would be politically stupid, but possible. Just on the balance of probabilities, the recriminalisation of abortion is a long shot. You can message "I told you so" if it happens. But I predict (and hope) it stays hypothetical.
25. I mean blame who you want. But as you know well, it‚Äôs ultimately on the person who said it.
26. And how can you be sucked in so badly with the scare tactics we have seen on this issue. It‚Äôs an opinion. Would you put your life savings and everything you own on the fact that he‚Äôs going to renege and ban abortion in legislation?
27. Has that question been asked? I mean he can‚Äôt answer questions he hasn‚Äôt been asked hahahahhahaha.
28. So all those promises you voted on yesterday, you actually completely distrust as well?
29. I‚Äôm sorry you went through that, we should fight for women to have more support in cases like yours and even supporting women more during pregnancy to minimise abortions. More resources and guidance. That is healthcare. It doesn‚Äôt matter that you believe most abortions are for medical conditions, it‚Äôs just plain facts unfortunately what I said. I love you for pushing though in your first pregnancy, your child should know, they will look at you as a hero!
30. And like I said, you would have been covered even without the 2018 ‚Äúany reason‚Äù termination bill.
31. Covid would have been a boom time for her I heard Only fans went crazy
32. No, I want you to tell me. Why is abortion not murder? Why is it healthcare?
33. My drugs are Dutton as PM and Trump as President
34. I was quoting that mentally unstable person and I stand by exactly my response, she is a horrible person and is mentally unstable. If you or anyone agrees with them, you belong in that group as well.
35. [deleted]
36. Why do you need statistics to prove the obvious? It‚Äôs like telling me you need statistics to prove majority of people are overweight
37. Yes, and FYI that is already the offical guidance, so in that case the bill would simply be enshrining the current medical practice into law.
38. üôåüôåüôå
39. It‚Äôs not about saving babies it‚Äôs about killing them
40. you don‚Äôt understand the risks pregnancy poses to women. You‚Äôre not at all thinking about the mother, whose life can very easily be taken if her baby is not viable. it WILL kill women forcing them to carry non viable fetus.
41. If you read the first paragraph of my reply, you'll see that I'm talking about terminations for medical reasons, which relates to babies which are absolutely not "perfectly healthy". You would do well to perhaps read up on the subject.
42. If you read the first paragraph of my reply, you'll see that I'm talking about terminations for medical reasons, which relates to babies which are absolutely not "perfectly healthy". You would do well to perhaps read up on the subject.
43. Forcing an oxygen tube into a tiny deformed dying fetus, or making doctors attempt CPR on an infant they know will not survive, is absolutely far more horrifying than a medical procedure to remove a small shapeless blob. No one is aborting fully formed, 'perfectly healthy' babies ffs Like be for fucking real lmfao
44. [deleted]
45. plausible only to fools. its obvious as hell to anyone with the brains of a flea
46. Yes, and you‚Äôll know that the legality relied on ‚Äúrisk to a woman‚Äôs health‚Äù which is extremely open to interpretation in many cases. Again it‚Äôs good you got the care you need but don‚Äôt use that to discourage others from protecting important laws.
47. Sounds like your experience mostly revolves around Brisbane? Outside of Brisbane access was and still is hard. It's been improved incredibly by the change in legislation, including public hospitals being compelled to provide pathways to abortion. You are speaking entirely from your experience, and saying it "didn't seem like" when there is literally evidence to the contrary you could find with a single google search. Presenting the situation as less bad than it is/was is not at all helpful, and gives people the wrong impression.
48. Non-enforcement of criminal penalties is not the same as not illegal. Abortion was illegal in Queensland prior to 2018, and abortion clinics were raided by police in the 1980s in accordance with laws at the time.
49. Fucking Christ you‚Äôre dumb mate. You know what an example is don‚Äôt you? I just went with the first two that I thought of. I don‚Äôt support either of them and you‚Äôd have to be fucking brain dead to think I did. The reason I said them is a) because they‚Äôre the first ones I thought of and b) they‚Äôre on complete opposite ends of the spectrum. I did that so no one could point and shout that I‚Äôm biased but somehow stupid has managed to do it anyway. Go grow a brain you fucking tool
50. The fact that you think you know better than medical professionals who actually perform reproductive care for actual pregnant women is extremely telling. "I feel this way about a topic, so facts be damned, I'm right and everyone else is wrong". You're too much of a dumbass to know you're a dumbass. I have nothing else to say to you.
51. There are NO viable babies dying outside of the womb FFS. 1% of abortions occur after 22 weeks, and they are for fetal abnormalities. a 'healthy' baby induced to die on the table after 22 weeks would be (while technically legal and possible) incredibly rare indeed.
52. I'm not blaming anyone unfortunately as long as the QLD LNP don't remove the two Pumped hydro projects and simply commit funding to them everything will be fine. We need those hydro projects to replace the Aging coal infrastructure which is rapidly approaching EOL.
53. > he‚Äôs going to renege and ban abortion in legislation? are you ok? you clearly do not understand what the question is? he is being asked if he would allow a conscious vote which he refused to answer. you are asking if he is going to ban abortion himself. those are different things?
54. Yeah, would be impossible for him to inform the public through a clear statement without being asked. And he's been asked over 100 times about a conscience vote. He hasn't answered it directly yet. Instead he avoids questions about conscience votes with "not in our plan" or "\*I\* believe in a woman's right to choose" never providing direct information about what he will do would KAP introduce the Bill. Politically, the easiest way to deal with it is to allow a conscience vote. If he shuts down his white christian nationalist MPs (which is the majority of them), then he risks losing control of the party room. If he puts it to a conscience vote, he will be able to appease them AND argue that it wasn't LNP policy, creating arms length from the laws. There is no reason I've seen as to why the LNP members wont vote differently than what they did in 2018.
55. Certainly do. You don't make votes based on promises. Just like you never buy a product based on what it could be in the future. Same principle
56. Thank you but I was lucky I had a supportive partner who could pay all my bills and a workplace who didn‚Äôt give me grief for being off sick. That doesn‚Äôt normally happen for most women hence why they make these heartbreaking decisions. I once had a a&e nurse say just get an abortion if you‚Äôre that sick because I dared to ask for more fluids ( my bloods came back and showed I needed fluids but that‚Äôs what I up against) plus I was a skeleton. Yes, there should be more support but there is absolutely none therefore women will need to terminate for these reasons. Daily women terminate on the HG fb group and are so heartbroken as these babies are wanted but no help available. As a 31 year old woman, who works with women ( nurse ) only time I‚Äôve had friends who have had abortions is because the man basically forces them too ( says they will ruin their lives and beg them not to keep it ) Or due to a miscarriage.
57. You stench of jealousy. Tell me, after you and your friends all cum on the cookie, do you volunteer to eat it?
58. Ok I‚Äôll do the hard work for you, ya lazy fuck. A foetus doesn‚Äôt have human rights. Humans have human rights because, we are human beings. A foetus is not a human being, unless the host allows it to become one. If I don‚Äôt consent to a foetus using my body then I am allowed to defend myself to terminate the unwanted pregnancy. Don‚Äôt tell me I have to teach you about consent too?
59. talk about an overdose
60. Lmao go back to posting about dragons on the Wings of Fire subreddit.
61. [deleted]
62. That's nice, but what about healthy pregnancies?
63. i know you were. do you also find it horrific when healthy pregnancies are aborted?
64. Humans are not fully formed until they finish puberty. You are not being for real. You do not care about healthy babies, so don't pretend to care about sick babies.
65. They can add that, sure. But why haven‚Äôt they?
66. I‚Äôm not discouraging. I just think it‚Äôs disingenuous for people to say LNP wants to make abortion ‚Äòillegal again‚Äô as if nobody could access care before when they absolutely could.
67. Rural access is an issue in every state because there aren‚Äôt resources to have surgeries everywhere. That‚Äôs not a QLD issue. I worked for RFDS in remote NSW & we literally had to fly women to Sydney for abortions. That‚Äôs nothing to do with legislation. I‚Äôm glad access has been improved with referral pathways.
68. ‚ÄòMate‚Äô, you just proved you know nothing about politics with a couple comments. But I do enjoy that you keep digging. Go join Jono with his outrageous claims or find another minority to blame for your problems with Pauline.
69. Doesn‚Äôt blame anyone‚Ä¶ next half sentence hypothetical blames the LNP for something that hasn‚Äôt even occurred yet. Nice.
70. Can you read? Apologies if English is your second language, but this is fairly clear: ‚ÄúThose laws will not change, my team has backed in that position,‚Äù he said.

72. Mustn‚Äôt be a fan of the stock market then. Or investing in general. But back to policy, guess you aren‚Äôt a fan of any project or initiatives as well. Let‚Äôs not buy into building more schools, hospitals, infrastructure either, based on the fact that you don‚Äôt buy a product based on what it could be able to achieve in the future. Interesting train of thought.
73. Sorry Ivy at first I thought you were just a Labor stooge I didn‚Äôt realize you were an actual crazy person. Same same
74. Riiiiiiiight. Whatever you have to tell yourself to cope with killing your babies.

78. because, no abortion will be carried out at that stage unless the fetus has an abnormality that makes it incompatible with life. They could add the wording into the legislation if they wanted to, but it is completely unnecessary.
79. abortions after 20weeks make up 1% of abortions, they are done for medical reasons. nobody is carrying a healthy baby for five months, then being medically induced to give birth. You‚Äôre not pro-life you‚Äôre pro forced birth.
80. If a pregnant person does not want to have a baby, healthy or not, then they should not be forced to carry and birth that baby.
81. No. Happy?
82. Pro-choice does not always equal pro-abortion. Pro-choice recognises that a person should have legal access to an abortion for any reason. That reason is irrelevant to anyone but the pregnant person. Female bodily autonomy should never have become a political agenda. You know what else prevents abortion? Vasectomies. Vasectomies can be reversed and they have little side-effect when compared to the contraceptive pill. Maybe we should bring statutory vasectomies for males of reproductive age to the political table.
83. Nope, doesn't bother me at all. Very happy to see other women taking control of their reproductive health instead of suffering through an unwanted pregnancy!
84. I absolutely care about healthy babies- I want every baby to be born to parents who want to have a child and are ready to properly care for them. *You* are the one who doesn't actually give a shit about the well-being of these hypothetical 'healthy babies'; once they're born you couldn't care less about what happens to them. *You* want their mothers to be forced to carry them to term & birth them, regardless of risk to their mental and physical health. Even a healthy baby is at risk of abuse if the mother is suffering from PPD/PPP, and unwanted babies are much more likely to be victims of abuse and infanticide. *You* want these babies to suffer through the trauma of enduring the foster care/adoption system. It's incredibly difficult and expensive to be approved for adoption in Australia, and the demand is low. Once the baby is a few years old, the chance of adoption drops drastically. *You* want these babies to grow up knowing they were unwanted by their birth parents and their mothers were forced to carry them to term. I'd encourage you to read a bit about adoption trauma and why many adoptees are staunchly opposed to the practice. Get the fuck off your 'i care about babies' high horse. Your beliefs are completely antithetical to what you claim to care about- the wellbeing of babies is (shockingly!) heavily dependent on the wellbeing of their mothers. Women do not have an obligation to incubate whatever stray embryo lodges in their uterus, and it's really as simple as that.

86. Access was pretty limited in some regional areas (to be honest still is in many places), and people had to travel interstate in some circumstances, for example later term procedures. And basically zero procedures done in public hospitals because doctors just didn‚Äôt want to do it and people paying 100s or 1000s out of pocket to access the procedure privately as the only option. Some of these things are still issues. It‚Äôs an aspect of healthcare that simply doesn‚Äôt need any more barriers. It‚Äôs not disingenuous to say they want to criminalise abortion because they definitely do. Adding abortion back into the criminal code would also send a very strong chilling message to doctors and health care workers that this is once again off the table. As opposed to putting up with an outdated law that was still hanging around and causing issues. Dig into the background of some of the newly elected LNP MPs and you‚Äôll find some fairly strong anti abortion views.
87. With the price of going to a GP and the price for things like ultrasounds which are things you had to get prior to the decriminalisation of course there are people who would prefer not to do that with the cost of living.
88. Mate, it has everything to do with legislation. If it is already onerous for doctors to legally perform abortions because of backwards legislation, then the only doctor in a small town is not going to jump through those hoops. If they don't need to because it is legislated and there are clear guidelines, then abortions become easier to perform and therefore easier to access. You are still conflating your personal experience which is not reflective of the available evidence.
89. Jesus fucking Christ stfu. I AM a fucking minority. I‚Äôm Latino. I‚Äôm done arguing with you. You‚Äôre too stupid to reason with. Either that or you‚Äôre purposely being contrarian and rage baiting. Get a life dude.
90. Well its within there "plan" which is mostly budget cuts and destroying the public service again. Here is a [source ](https://southburnett.com.au/news2/2024/06/13/lnp-looks-at-smaller-pumped-hydro/)behind its in there plan for others who might not know. "*The LNP will investigate opportunities for smaller, more manageable pumped hydro projects.*" Which pretty much means, We are going to keep operating coal and gas generators.
91. So once again mate, try rubbing those 2 braincells together and think about why he refused to answer the question about a conscious vote, do you know what a conscious vote even is?
92. Wait, I‚Äôve heard this before. ‚ÄúNow, now, don‚Äôt you worry about that!‚Äù
93. Big fan of investing, actually. Not all investment is a gamble, y'know. What? You're confusing yourself trying to disagree. Building schools, hospitals, and infrastructure is tangible, and will objectively do good if they are utilised, which they obviously will be, because the government doesn't exactly want to waste its money on building something and then leaving it to rot. Duh. Pretty fantastic train of thought, actually, but I'm curious as to how you try to disagree.
94. Sounds like you do volunteer to eat it
95. I‚Äôve never even had an abortion bro üíÄ I think I actually might have educated you even a little bit though cos you didn‚Äôt have a good come back
96. Your avatar looks like shit and your art sucks. Is that your answer?
97. I'm not going to argue you. You're wrong and maybe should go back to talking about Roblox instead.

99. i was asking about all healthy pregnancies. you don't wanna answer...
100. The word "if" is doing an awful lot in that sentence. "If" a mother wants to kill her chid, she should be allowed to? That is insane, how could you say such vile nonsense? Why would any mother want to do such a thing? Try putting force into this subject in an honest way. If a mother wants to force her baby to die in the womb, she should be allowed to... right? No, that's absolutely ludicrous.
101. strange. poor babies.
102. >Pro-choice does not always equal pro-abortion. Yes, it does. The choice in question is abortion. Trying to reframe abortion as an issue of personal freedom is profoundly dishonest. >Female bodily autonomy Baby body survival. Stop being dishonest.
103. >Very happy to see other women taking control of their reproductive health instead of suffering through an unwanted pregnancy! "Very happy to see other women killing their babies instead of becoming mothers!" Why can't you pro-abortion people ever, ever, ever say things directly? Why would any sane person be happy that mothers don't want their own children? It's like a cult of infanticide at this point, you guys just spout the most vile things like you're ordering ice cream.
