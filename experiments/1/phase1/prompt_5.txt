Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

3. Wow.. labor voters in Qld are worse than fucking cockroaches at SOO. Wait till the suppressed corruption reports come out, gonna need more midnight paper shredding trucks Mr Smiley
4. The private school boys use more cocaine than the lot of us.
5. I can’t lie I laughed when I read this. The simple yet scarily accurate truth to that is mortifying. Having been an attendee for 7 years at one of these private schools it doesn’t leave me suprised unfortunately. My cohort were progressive within reason and opened the door within the institution for a lot of good change to follow in the years after us. The administrators were the worst though, again blatantly disregarding the advice of external bodies to protect their personal interests and leave them ingrained within the culture, despite being somewhat abhorrent. It just seems like lunacy for a governing body to outright disregard what multiple organisations have to say about this topic, bearing in mind the organisation’s condemning this idea are the ones impacted the most regardless of outcome.
6. *unless it's their children. Then they're just a poor (read 'unlucky', not impoverished, ew) kid suckered in by the wrong crowd.
7. It's not just getting rid of pill testing, it's the regression to a "tough on crime" approach, e.g. changes to the 3 strikes rule. QLD does not want to go that way - here in NSW we still have insane drug detection dog programs, and the NSW coroner has written explicitly about overdose deaths caused by panic ingestion (when faced with sniffer dogs/aggressive police presence), particularly among very young women. Trust me, QLD doesn't want to follow that path.
8. How much by percentage was clean?
9. Unless they're still just a cluster of unthinking, uncaring cells. Then their 'lives' matter more than anyone else's.
10. TLDR - moron premier elect refuses to listen to experts on important matter like health surrounding drug policies setting QLD back many years in progress.
11. Thought about doing one actually but decided against it. The topic is to important to me to be able to condense what I wanted to say without leaving information gaps. Providing a full and transparent argument without it sounding like I was attacking instead of informing is important, at least to me anyways.
12. Ambulance ramping is/was a Labor thing.
13. If you took 3 seconds to read the first sentence where I very clearly state that this does not reflect my preferences towards political parties you’d realise that this isn’t a stab at a winner or loser. This is me expressing my views on a topic that the now in charge party anticipates on making significant changes to. At no point do I bash the LNP, say I prefer x over y etc. this is my expressing genuine concern over a matter that will affect a large group of people. Again, this post in no way shape or form reflects which party I prefer. I can not make this any clearer.
14. I'm not entirely sure you are aware of the history of corruption in Queensland lol How bad do you have to be as a party, that you get 1 go every 10 years or so, and then blow your load so hard to fuck everything up as quick as possible you don't get back in for another 3 or 4 elections? 🤣
15. Hahahahahahahaha bro you won what the fuck are you huffing copium so hard for?
16. Again, this post does not represent political preferences. It is presenting an opinion on 1 (singular) policy change. If the tables were flipped and labour, the greens, KAP etc. had proposed these changes, my view and post would remain unchanged. The issue is bigger than the political party, of which I could care less about. My interest stands with progression and harm reduction. Cheers!
17. True. I’d guess enforcement will be targeted at lower class drugs
18. At earth freq there were 103 samples tested and only 2 tested for a substance other than mdma (both were dimethypentylone) while one sample was lactose. This was the largest sample size that was report in the past year and given the type of event probably the data set with the most significance Other months have samples for mdma varying from 12 to 19 and each report showed only one with a psychoactive adultant along with mdma, with 3 or 4 with inactive additives like cellulose or msg i They changed their report for the latest month which is annoying but overall i was surprise how little adulterants are added in the sampled mdma in brisbane overall. A quick count I calculate only 4 or 5 psychoactive adulterants out of around 170 samples over the five report's this year. Granted Id imagine the type of person who makes the effort to test their pills probably a bit more savvy where and who they source their drugs from
19. It was actually the Liberal Party who pushed for the inquiry for JBP. Wait a few months, your mob are fucking rotten. A lot to come out. Every 10 years or so? You tell me.. Labor did not win for 32 years straight clown.
20. I saw some statistics once from NSW. The decision to prosecute or caution someone for possession of small quantities of marijuana often depends on your race. White people are only prosecuted about half the time. Indigenous people 82% of the time.
21. Apply that at scale.
22. 32 years of gerrymander too
23. So in order to fight the amount of corruption and political shit-fuckery that can be done, the first act of will be to re-instate the Senate? No, not an agenda item? Ahh, criminalizing abortion, fuck the poor school kids and stopping pill testing are what will fix housing, and crime ... FOR JESUS! You, are the clown I find myself much more anti-Liberal/National party then pro Labor party, it sadly leaves much fewer choices.
24. Australia isn't really susceptible to that sort of thing (currently) as electoral boundaries are not decided by party's but election beauro or whatever it is. Although when a corrupt government has power for 20+ years they can probably eventually slip people in. Point is, both sides regularly lose and gain seats via redistribution of electoral boundaries. Neither side really kicks up much fuss about it because it usually evens out over the whole.
25. Wtf are on about. This is just one of the messes they are cleaning up, most likely bought on by the fact of shredding trucks arriving when they thought no one would notice. More anti liberal than pro labor, yeah right fuckwit, how wholesome, keep telling yourself that.
26. Can't tell if the people down voting are just fucking dumb, or brainwashed by the american system that they don't understand ours doesn't work like that.

27. Well I'll eat my hat. I though they'd made no changes from the intial draft 24 months ago. Some interesting changes, most of which look good. Highly suspicious that this is released after the state election, when this network had to have been approved before caretaker mode started a month ago.
28. Happy to see 376 is retained (also happy for them to remove it once we have metro extended to Chermside and beyond). Can’t seem to find anything about 333 and 340 tho. Weren’t they meant to change their end station (340 terminating at Myer centre, 333 to follow busway to Gabba)?
29. Sigh. There was a potential new bus route for me but they’ve gone the option that’s not near me 😟
30. Any idea why the proposed gold city glider wasn’t invcluded in this? https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/traffic-and-transport/public-transport/buses/cityglider-bus-services
31. As a northside boy, can’t pretend I understand a lot of the changes given it is largely southern routes being reviewed in Metro’s wake. Very hopeful and excited for future reviews on the north side of town. I really support the principle of consolidating trunk routes, and increasing frequency of local services by making them terminate and transfer passengers to those trunks, freeing up buses for use in the suburbs rather than duplicating those trunks. 334 is a great example, serving neighbourhoods between Chermside and Kedron before following the 370 into the city from there, usually as a mostly empty bus.
32. 5min intervals! Gunna be lots of cope and seethe from the “um it’s not a real metro like Sydney which goes every 5minutes this is just a bus”. Yes. A bus that does the exact same thing but more fit for purpose for Brisbane and existing infrastructure
33. Where’s the South Brisbane free bus loop :(
34. Can I get a TLDR anyone?
35. Not happy Jan.
36. Let’s campaign for a rename - call it a BERT, Brisbane/ Busway Electric Rapid Transit. It’d save us doing the explaining to international visitors from West Europe and East Asia when they see buses with bi-articulated cabins and wheel covers…instead of multiple-unit trains on rail. Other than that, my experience onboard 169 recently convinced me that this was no “gadget-bahn”. Transport for Brisbane has done a good job of delivering the closest thing to light rail in a smoother ride (vs current tailpipe buses) due to better suspension and the electric drivetrain. Looking forward to them being rolled out to inner-northern busway and eastern busway to service Chermside & Carindale respectively eventually. Would also love to see BERT poke Air Train in the eye should they convince BAC to service Brisbane Airport. Though I wonder if they are gonna have purpose-fitted buses with luggage holding areas for suitcases as the current ones don’t have them.
37. "providing turn-up-and-go Brisbane Metro services arriving every 5 minutes during peak times and 24 hours on weekends" Does this mean it only arrives once a day on weekends?
38. Anyone know whether 184 being canned means that N184 is also canned? The 185 hasn't been increased to include night services, so I assume N184 remains...
39. Nooooooo my beautiful, quiet P173 service :(
40. Why the hell are busses still terminating at Toombul? What moron thinks that reasonible when nundah is 2 min up the road. "Flexibility of busses" ffs.
41. It's the Brisbane City Council, so they probably didn't need a lot of signoff from the State Govt. As far as I'm aware the State Govt just provides funds for the busses, but nothing much re: routes. Although I could be wrong on that.
42. [https://caportal.com.au/bcc/brisbane-metro](https://caportal.com.au/bcc/brisbane-metro) No reference in the PDF, but if you search for the 333 and 340 here, they'll both be travelling to the Gabba, the 333 via the busway and the 340 via the current allignment.
43. Because apparently, it still under a business case. [https://caportal.com.au/bcc/brisbane-metro](https://caportal.com.au/bcc/brisbane-metro) (Search GCG) This is even though somehow the business case was complete and the route fully funded 18 months ago. [https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/new-gold-cityglider-bus-route-and-battery-powered-ferry-for-brisbane-20230614-p5dgfq.html](https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/new-gold-cityglider-bus-route-and-battery-powered-ferry-for-brisbane-20230614-p5dgfq.html)
44. Through no cope or seethe, the Brisbane "Metro" is not on the same level as the [Sydney Metro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oXmT-JEDP8) and it is very simplistic to say they do "the exact same thing". 5 min intervals is awesome, but overall the project is pretty uninspiring. I don't know, time will tell. I am not saying Brisbane needs to spend $64BN on a Metro, but don't try and pretend like this is something it isn't - It's a glorified bus with shorter range and fancy wheelcovers. See previous discussions on - [Rename the Brisbane Metro - BERT (Brisbane Electric Rapid Transit)](https://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/1gaq80f/rename_the_brisbane_metro_bert_brisbane_electric/) Let's hope BCC and their new pals in the State Gov have some cool shit on the way for Olympics.
45. Despite asking several times I’ve still not got an answer as to why naming it a metro actually matters All I’ve got is “it’s just misleading and confusing” as if a metro coming every 5 mins and a big electric bus arriving every 5 minutes is so incredibly different
46. 5 minute intervals during peak; it doesnt say when that is, or what frequency will be out of those times.
47. * Metro 1 (replacing 111 and 160) and Metro 2 (replacing 66) * Two new peak routes to the city (26, P109), three new local routes (127, 182, 197) * 12 routes updated to terminate at Metro stations instead of going into the city (105, 110, 112, 113, 115, 135, 155, 161, 172, 179, 202, 203) * Three routes removed (28, 145, P151) * Four routes changed from peak only to all-day (135, 155, 192, 205) * Three routes split to improve reliability (379, 375, 470) * 12 routes merged with other services (108, 117, 124, 136, 174, 184, P129, P157, P173, P207, P343, 178) and a whole buttload of other minor changes
48. https://preview.redd.it/3o3f1xhu1gxd1.png?width=401&format=png&auto=webp&s=60a69145b05071e2160a26dca2613a60f91a94f2
49. No it means the bus runs 24 hours on weekends, so it doesn't stop running between like 10pm and 5am line a lot of busses do now. The sentence is awkward, the frequency won't be every 5 minutes on weekends so they should say what it is. I'm too lazy to look it up.
50. It's pathetic really. What a useless waste of capacity, push people back into cars is the goal I guess.
51. I asked the same question, but it's because they have the bus station thing there and it's a link to the rail station. Maybe in a decade when Toombul is a thing ago it'll make sense again.
52. Cos all available land for a possible bus interchange at either Nundah or Northgate are already developed into residential or retail/ service units. Toombul bus interchange site was also a negotiated arrangement between BCC and the owners of defunct Toombul Shoppingtown in a land swap for more parking on what is council land facing the Schulz Canal/ Kedron Brook. Other than that, it made sense to co-locate different modes of public transport to ease bus-rail transfers, though IMO, a better job would have been to resume the land closer to Toombul railway station (current dry cleaners/ op shop, tyre shop etc.) and relocate the bus interchange there, and eventually upgrade the station to be included in express rail services.
53. Transport for Brisbane (BCC) is a service provider to Translink (Like Queensland Rail, Clarks Bus Services, Kinetic etc.). While timetables are collaborative efforts with service providers, and BCC is a special provider in that they contribute up to 25% of operating costs, Translink has the final say in routes and timetable changes. That's why the pages clearly says: >Your feedback has been incorporated primarily in the inner city and south-eastern bus network and has been approved by Translink.
54. Thanks! Edit: looks like 340 will continue to go to gabba (via Cap Cook bridge) and stop at KGS for both directions.
55. Hence the “fit for purpose for Brisbane” Brisbane is not on the same level as Sydney and was never getting a Sydney level metro. But this is as good as a Brisbane metro was ever going to be
56. The infrastructure around it is the interesting part. Fast charging infrastructure that can charge the bus in around 6 minutes. Improvements to cultural centre. Strength upgrades to Victoria bridge. New tunnel to King George Square. A new dedicated depot. A whole lot of stop upgrades. And then the stuff you can't see like new bus system management systems and the change to a trunk and feeder system. The city has hit capacity for the number of busses it can support and this fixes the problem to a large degree. Now if we could only sort out the Logan busses in the city, which just seem to have the worst drivers and are always doing weird shit on Elizabeth Street, and we will be good. As for the name... probably not the best fit but metro is short for metropolitan and is also used to describe city mass transit systems.
57. I don’t think many people think it ‘matters’, but it’s a perfect example of how petty politics and politicians can be sometimes. It was announced it was going to be one thing, then they changed their minds, and it became something else. But Quirk point blank refused to ever admit that it was a substantive change. So it ended up with a silly misleading name simply because of silly political pride. Reddit likes to poke fun at such things.
58. So I'll respond to both of your questions, but I think I should clarify I'm not opposed to bi-articulated bus services on trunk services such as the 66 and 111/160, but there are problems. **Name:** First off calling it Metro is a political stunt, and easily rectified by the pulling the stickers off the bi-articulated buses. But the problem arises back in 2016, "Brisbane Metro" was first announced. This was a rubber-tyred metro to run from Woolloongabba to Herston. This was an attrocious plan and was scrapped in 2017. What replaced it was a bus project, that still had the same name. That's the problem with the name, we're not getting a rubber-tyred metro like promised. We're getting a busway upgrade, which is a better use of money, but it's misleading to pretend it's what was first proposed. **Frequency:** First and foremost, the upgrade to the 66 to M2 is good. It currently runs in peak at 5 min interval like the bi-articulated buses will but with space for 40 more people. But the 111/160 is another story, which is why if you look at the network revision lot's of buses are being redirected to feed M2 at the PA, rather than the M1 at Greenslopes. Currently in peak 111 runs at 12 buses per hour (Bph) with 100 seat buses and the 160 runs at 6 Bph with buses with capacity from around 60-100. M1 will run at 12 Bph with 150 capacity buses. So this is essentially a reduction in frequency and capacity, all the while they were feeding more bus users onto the M1, which seems to be generally rectified with the new bus network revision. The same problem happens off peak with 111 being 4 bph on 100 capacity buses and the 160 being 4 bph with 60-100 seats buses (More likely to 60 though). Once again a massive reduction in frequency, a minor decrease in capacity. Through the evening and on weekends when the 160 doesn't operate capacity is increase and frequency is maintained, although the 111 services then are rarely full anyway. Essentially the M1 was going to funnel more people on less services, which combined had less capacity than before. With these changes it's just a reduction in frequency and a minor reduction in capacity, rather than also driving more passengers.
59. It doesn’t matter. The original plan was for it to be an actual metro but they changed it to a bus but kept the name.
60. What would matter seriously? Is there a critereon that would declasssify it as metro? And you are talking about a 5 times capacity difference you know?
61. Because words have meanings. If I went around calling myself Prime Minister of Australia but really meant unemployed bum you would think I was a dumb fuck, just like calling this a metro is dumb.
62. 15 min off peak. "turn up and go"/s
63. Wasn’t the 145 a non stop bus to browns plains? Iirc that route was usually pretty busy
64. Thank you sir. Sounds like great progress as whole.
65. Hm, I’m concerned about the 160 getting replaced. I know there’s a lot of overlap with the 111 but if you want to get to the Myer Centre from Buranda, Greenslopes, or Holland Park, it’s the only option without a transfer or walking from King George. If the 150 or 140 got those added 3 stops though, which doesn’t look like it’s in the plan, that would be great.
66. In a decade, the trimframe when a light rail system could be built from scratch. Nundah also has rail acess (and better rail access). The toombul interchange is also just a car park rotundah, scarsley infrastructure.
67. You are right, busses seemingly require almost as much infrastructure as light or even heavy rail. And bus interchanges require decades of forthought. Unfortunately there is no quiet street next to a cricket pitch there that could be used as a temporary interchange (one where railbusses already stop). Nope not a chance. /s
68. >Brisbane is not on the same level as Sydney and was never getting a Sydney level metro. Agreed, it was never going to be that big and doesn't need to be. >But this is as good as a Brisbane metro was ever going to be Doubt on that. There has been significant scope scaled back, including an [underground interchange stations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfcJNYPYD7s) as well as hundreds of millions in additional costs for little gain. I am all for public transport infrastructure improvements, but this project just lacks something for how much marketing it receives, and maybe it is my fault for not knowing what that is.
69. “fit for purpose for Brisbane” = will scarcely cover existing demand and crumble with any increased demand?
70. "mass transit" = equivalent capacity of 2 or 3 trains per hour?
71. Everytime the term metro is brought up iv never seen it being about that the plan changed. Its always been that it’s not a train and that a lot of metros are trains and people from overseas will be confused it’s not a train and how many metros are busses and how many are trains. I mean I’v been downvoted a lot saying that metro is short for metropolitan, as in a pt system in a metropolitan or to a metropolitan. But people keep on insisting that metro = train. It’s only the reddit minority that care but they care a lot.
72. “ but it's misleading to pretend it's what was first proposed” I agree. But that’s not my point. My point is why does it matter?. As long as the outcome is the same that’s all anyone actually cares about. If there’s a metro-like public transport service I don’t care if it’s called metro or has no tracks, as long as it does the job Same goes for frequency. As long as it is as frequent and accessible as I’d expect a Brisbane metro to be (which it is, regardless of if it could be better) then it doesn’t matter if it’s called a metro if it fulfils the same function
73. Also do you have a source for the current bus capacity? All I can see online is very very few busses have capacity over 100, I doubt they have enough of them to be consistently doing that at 18bph
74. Probably worth mentioning even though they are launching with 5 minutes between buses they have the ability to increase this if the demand is there.
75. Exactly. Some people though seem to think it really does matter a lot though even though it does the same job as a Brisbane metro would have done anyway
76. exactly. Even if it’s a dumb name it still doesn’t matter lol some dumb fuck calling themselves prime minister can go ahead and do that all they like. No one will care
77. And metro means metropolitan
78. 1.3B later, and you almost get the same service, its so sad. You know some people are saying they spent all this money, and the busway network doesnt even have any new stops. so sad, so very sad.
79. 142? The 145 went from Browns Plains to Griffith Uni
80. They do mention this in finer details, I think they just expect people to walk. King George Square and Myer Center are very close.
81. Yeah man, I'm here with you. This really flies in the face of "Flexibility of buses". I've personally scarcely seen this flexibility be put to good work by a transit agency on a large scale, besides the usual tinkering with routes like here. But this extension to Nundah seems like the perfect case for it, and a real slam dunk, adapting to a suddenly drastically different situation with a simple fix. Missed opportunity for sure.
82. People in Sydney probably said they’d never be as big before the 2000 Olympics but anything can happen.
83. " a pt system in a metropolitan or to a metropolitan." so almost every PT system in the entire world? When everything is a metro, nothing is.
84. Yeah, as I said people are pedantic here about it because of the way it happened. People aren’t going to give you the full history every time, but that’s how it started and it’s since developed a life of its own.
85. Are you seriously trying to justify not pulling a sticker off a bus? It's not what was originally promised, it a broken promise, and 8 years later they're still pretending they didn't break a promise. If you don't see a problem with that I'm sorry. Did you not read? M1 is less frequent than the buses it replaces and has less capacity during peak times, when the buses are actually used. And it's arguable whether it's more accessible, because the Jury is still out on that I would say they're less accessible than the buses they replace. It honestly seems like you don't use PT.
86. Brisbane Currently has 70 articulated buses, which have a capacity around 100 and an additional 150 Two-Axle buses with a capacity just under 100 see: Articulated bus lists: [https://brisbanetransport.info/?GoTo=searchfleet&find=MAN%20NG313%20artic%20\[Custom%20Coaches\]&searching=yes](https://brisbanetransport.info/?GoTo=searchfleet&find=MAN%20NG313%20artic%20[Custom%20Coaches]&searching=yes) [https://brisbanetransport.info/?GoTo=searchfleet&find=Volvo%20B8RLEA%20\[Volgren\_Optimus\]&searching=yes](https://brisbanetransport.info/?GoTo=searchfleet&find=Volvo%20B8RLEA%20[Volgren_Optimus]&searching=yes) Two Axle Buses: [https://brisbanetransport.info/?GoTo=fleetspecs&find=Scania+K310UB6x2+%5BVolgren%5D&searching=yes](https://brisbanetransport.info/?GoTo=fleetspecs&find=Scania+K310UB6x2+%5BVolgren%5D&searching=yes) [https://brisbanetransport.info/?GoTo=searchfleet&find=Volvo%20B12BLE%20\[Volgren\]&searching=yes](https://brisbanetransport.info/?GoTo=searchfleet&find=Volvo%20B12BLE%20[Volgren]&searching=yes) The articulated buses run most 111 services, with the occasional Two-Axle Bus, and the even more rare cover from a 12.5m bus. The 160 is a mix of articulated buses, Two-Axle buses and regular 12.5m buses which have a capacity of 62 [https://brisbanetransport.info/?GoTo=fleetspecs&find=MAN+18.310+%28CNG%29+%5BVolgren%5D&searching=yes](https://brisbanetransport.info/?GoTo=fleetspecs&find=MAN+18.310+%28CNG%29+%5BVolgren%5D&searching=yes) There are 60 bi-articulated buses comparded to 220 with capacities around 100, Transport for Brisbane does have capacity for over 100 bus services per hour with buses with around 100 capacity. edit: Found a more reliable source for the 40 B8RLEA (articulated buses) [https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/new-super-sized-15-million-bus-fleet-won-t-fit-in-bus-stops-20180206-p4yzjl.html](https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/new-super-sized-15-million-bus-fleet-won-t-fit-in-bus-stops-20180206-p4yzjl.html) Which says a capacity of 113, so actually a fare bit more than 100.
