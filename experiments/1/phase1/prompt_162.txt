Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. State-wide they're actually more popular than ever. It's just Greenslanders aren't concentrated enough in any electorates, they've likely been priced out of their former seats in the city
2. The green vote went up in one of the most bias media campaigns in Australian history. The LNP were winning using a literal cardboard cutout in a deputy leadership debate and the closest thing to a cheer squad for Labor was the ABC hosted by former sky news hosts Speers and Karvelas.
3. I used to be a greens voter until I realised that some Greens MPs are actually just NIMBYS that have been given a position of power. Look at Max Chandler Mather, instead of delivering on core greens policies (real action on climate change, dental into medicare, improved housing) he's spent most of his term trying to impose a curfew on Brisbane airport so that the rich people living in Bulimba and Hawthorne don't have to put up with ghastly aircraft noise while they sleep in their multi million dollar homes. He's also spent a bunch of time supporting the free palestine movement and CFMEU, while also massively opposing the development of the Bulimba Barracks site into high density residential housing which is literally at odds with his party's position on increasing housing supply. Oh, and when you have people like Jonathan Sri claiming that immigration has nothing to do with house prices and rents going up - I mean come on. You can't just reject the idea of supply and demand, that's not how it works. The greens seriously need to go back to their roots, focus on things like public transport, clean energy, housing (building the fucking things, not capping rents or house prices), etc. Until they do that, they're not getting my vote anymore.
4. Well perhaps it’s got something to do with them being a “Green” party which doesn’t seem to be for the Environment at all (which is usually what Green denotes). For whatever reason they made the choice to rebrand publicly as the Palestine party occasionally featuring feminism. I guess that’s not as popular in QLD as on reddit.
5. Because they have been fucking garbage ever since Bob Brown left. They lost sight of their core values.
6. Haha, Labor lose, state turns to right-wing ideology and you're surprised that Greens lost the two seats they had? The biggest take away from the election is Labor lost despite given the biggest cost of living relief in the State's history. Stop deflecting from the real take away from this election. The Green's primary vote was still the same as last election, unlike Labor's over 6% decrease. They should be ashamed. We need to talk about why LNP won? What did Labor do or not do to cause that to happen. How do we need to change democracy so that the media isn't the LNP's lapdog and ban election donations. Not left infighting!
7. Thank God.
8. When Labor put up policies like free school lunches and 50c fares, the Greens response was basically “they got that idea from us”. It was one of the weakest Greens campaigns I’ve seen at any level. They needed to lean into the Greens stereotype of big progressive ideas that they don’t necessarily need to execute. Ideas they can use to pressure Labor into making more progressive choices. It’s a shame. Without the presence of Berkman and Macmahon, I think Labor will be more inclined to drift towards LNP-like ideas to win back power.
9. Also, I wouldn't write Maiwar off for the Greens just yet. It'll be close on preferences.
10. Federal Greens have done a lot of damage to the QLD Greens. Max has a lot to answer for here, he has allowed the media to put him forward as the face of obstructing new homes, in a position that should be occupied by Peter Dutton. The Greens need to stop “playing politics” and get back to their strengths, like acting as a counterweight to shift the Overton Window back to the left.
11. I know many people who previously voted for the Greens and didn’t this election. They still support the Greens, but their reasoning was that they felt they needed to do everything they could to keep Labor in power, and they felt that electing Greens members would make that more difficult. I don’t think people have stopped supporting them, they just had different priorities this election.
12. 1) The QLD Greens received more votes than ever before 2) it’s hard to weather a 6% swing against the left 3) they have 1 in and South Brisbane is still a slim possibility. 4) It’s very unusual to lose a Greens MP - they do a great job 4) in the 2020 state election, the fossil fuel industry spent $5.7 on anti-greens ads. We will only know who spent what in a month or two as we don’t have real time data (deliberately) 5) Advance Australia have started a $5 million anti-greens campaign. They have employed 23 staff at this point 6) 100% of the big newspapers are Murdoch media and the free; LNP propaganda arm- Sky News is ubiquitous in regional areas Any questions?
13. I have always voted Greens and this year I did not and will not likely vote for them ever again.. My friends (who also voted Greens every year) feel the same way. The Greens used to advocate for climate change and had good social policies that balanced neoliberalism in Australia. This year they are horrific and I’m mortified by their lack of attention to social issues in Australia. They are too busy waving a Palestinian flag and being tokenistic.
14. Probably because the party of populist agenda with no actual detail of how they would implement things got found out. Also the first people to vote against progress so couldn’t have happened to a nicer bunch of people.
15. When I think of The Greens, I'm not thinking of their "Hey, wouldn't it be nice if people didn't have to live in tents, and we really should be investing more in renewable energy" policies - I'm thinking of someone with they/them pronouns and rainbow coloured hair angrily protesting some injustice elsewhere in the world or made-up problem. I don't want the latter anywhere near State Government, and it's pretty obvious most QLD voters feel the same way.
16. Labor got what it asked for. Instead of running with the Greens, they campaigned at all levels against them. The results speak for themselves.
17. Its because people have realised they are a fad and recognised they are obstructive and dont do jack shit. Protest over progress, the clown pest of the classroom.
18. Constantly engaging in obstructionist politics, blocking decent Labor policy and generally blocking progress by having a shit fit because a given piece of legislation isn’t perfect.
19. The greens no longer appeal to the 'edgy', non-conforming voters. They had a great stance many years ago.
20. Greens aren't liked outside the SEQ bubble.
21. Good. Green electorates tend to be inner city. That's where homelessness, high rents, unaffordable housing is. Through LGA and Labor fear of green s, the Greens have had great influence on State housing policy. Result? Redevelopement after redevelopment blocked. Fall in rentals as landlords sell up. Rents rocketing. Rich suburbs redevelopements blocked by posh Green voters. Jacinta Allen in Vic has the right idea, promote housing redevelopment. The Greens, Teals and there posh supporters hate it and just like Qld Greens, are trying to block it.
22. I think the Greens lost votes because Labor was taking over their policies. In 2020 in some seats the LNP preferenced Greens over ALP in order to make an upset, for instance with Jackie Trad. They didn't do that this time. The ALP also put them behind some free marijuana candidates.
23. “Voters have abandoned them”. Not quite true. Greens first preference vote overall was 9.5%, same as last election. Labor went down 6.8%, LNP up 6%.
24. So they'll be free to do some direct climate action now.. pick up rubbish, clean out water ways/creeks and pants and the likes
25. Because the voting system is not terribly representative. Especially given Queensland only has a single chamber, we should really have something like MMP for electing the parliament.
26. Maiwar says Hello!
27. Change to the Legalise Cannabis Party so they gain more traction.
28. Their incessantly unworkable economic policies. They need to hire an economist to help them come up with actually coherent and functional economic policies.
29. Recollect takes me immediately to 'pig city' 1989 at Brisbane after to a fresher at uni, after years of Johannes Bjelke-Petersen rule from the Nationals. Then still later Peter Beattie and Anna Bligh for Labor and the ALP. Heartland talks about Logan Wynnum and Inala must suffice at times they just don't. Campbell Newman for the LNP coalition, and back to a long decade of Anastasia Paluzsche (sp.). Here we are again David!
30. It's because the greens are more interested in stupid social justice issues and supporting things like Palestine which has nothing to do with Australia..Adam bannt refuses to stand with the Australian flag .. Australia first
31. They have Federal seats in Brisbane (e.g. in my electorate, which was formerly LNP)
32. Fantastic news, I see no negative here, the greens lost all seats because they’re too extreme, simples.
33. Why? Greens are no longer green is why. They need to get rid of this current useless mob and start again. Edit, Berkman was OK
34. The Greens are all nutcases. It's not surprising
35. Good
36. A fantastic outcome.
37. I agree with others that say Berkman and McMahon have been likeable and doing a good job. The Greens have definitely been hurt by their federal performance and their local performance, like Jonathan Sri. It must've sucked to have Sri as your local council member when he was never there, off protesting things in other cities
38. I’m a long term Greens voter who has switched to Labor more recently. Greens policies are no longer designed to actually work, but to garner attention. Controlling RBA interest rates for example. Their housing policy is as blatantly unrealistic as LNPs nuclear policy. They simultaneously claim to represent those affected by the housing crisis while making it as hard and expensive as possible to build higher density living. Their support for the CFMEU is crazy. If any organisation is responsible for the increase in construction costs it’s them! Jonathan Sri was my councillor for a few years. One of his dumbest ideas was proposing to remove car parking from Dornoch Terrace, so that it was safer for cyclists. Cyclist safety I understand is important. But really it’s easier for cyclists to avoid that street, or build a proper cycle pathway. Not removing residents parking spots on a single street. Their stance on Palestine through their silence on Hamas has switched my vote. Their policies are supposed to be socially progressive, so why not fight against an organisation that kills gays, doesn’t let women drive and kills people at music festivals? They don’t give a f@ck about supporting Ukraine democracy against an invading Russia in comparison.
39. A vote for the Greens is a waisted vote. Lots of promising but will never be able to deliver
40. The Greens 1st preference vote grew. Voters don’t abandon the Greens, they just preference them lower. Preferences are everything for the Greens. People who vote Greens 1st aren’t swing voters. When the Greens win seats it’s because enough voters put them ahead of the LNP / Labor.
41. I think the Greens have actually been their own worst enemy over the last 18 months. Their stubborn opposition to Labor's housing policies because they weren't perfect and didn't include absolutely everything the Greens demanded will come back to bite them I feel. I'm actually predicting a drop in support for the Greens next year and will instead see a big jump in independent support.
42. Greens are now seen as the party of terrorism supporters, not people who care for the environment.
43. Thank god, the last thing we need are more woke gender benders
44. The Greens focused on things that maybe would have helped short term but definitely not long term. They targeted investors way too much when we actually need them, or at least I do as a renter. I think QLD spoke tonight and they definitely got it right. The Greens to go back to the core of what their party is about and get back on track.
45. Great result. I actually predicted that as someone who lives in a Greens electorate. I’m about to cash in I’d they do lol. That are full of empty promises and case more about protesting the middle east than their own constituentes
46. Delightful. Only better news was if they somehow got negative seats.
47. If the Green brigade of self righteous morons had any true support they’d have won seats. Their election result speaks for itself…. Zero, zilch, none! Good riddance and take your virtue signalling idiocy on your way out.
48. One of the main draw cards they had was transport costs and cleaner energy . Miles gov could offer that and more.
49. I liked their ideas about rent and all but they've always gone against their word cant be trusted and for me its their support of terrorism and violence that i said im not voting for them no more.
50. Maybe this will be a lesson for the greens to stop virtue signalling and get back to the basics that actually affect everyday Aussies
51. Probably because they care about two middle eastern dumps that have been fighting for 1000years ínstead of their constituents
52. Their bullshit stance on Israel. Fools.
53. Because the greens are jew haters. They support Hitler and Palestine.. Or have you been asleep past months
54. The obvious reason why green have lost is that the have become a hard-core Marxists party, with a very thin green outer layer.
55. Why would anyone vote for greens, they want to legalise necrophylia & beastiality - it has always been a front for the no god, no industry, lgbtqqss?? total etopia having sex with anyone or anything. Support the ridiculous transgender mutilation so these people will be depending on drugs from big pharma for life. Suicide rate is 70% I wonder why? Don't change what God has designed or there is always big consequences.
56. That doesn't come out of nowhere though, the Katters have been campaigning and winning there since the 1960s. That is 60 years of campaigning in the same place, it's just obvious they're popular.
57. For me I always vote greens but I was so worried about the libs taking our seat I put labour first. I think our seat is holding on my less than 1% so it’s a close one.
58. They have lost seats which means there are specific voters which have abandoned the Greens and they didn't find enough new voters to compensate. (*although they have a good chance to keep Maiwar. They suffered a massive swing of 7.3% on primary vote, which means a net 17% of people who voted Green last time changed, mostly to the ALP, but as as long as ALP preferences flow about 2/3 Green the Greens will keep the seat) This is now a national trend, at state, council and ACT elections. The reason is surely housing, where the Greens have hugely prioritised bad policies and blocked good policies. Brisbane is a city where the housing situation is dire. This is why the Greens were so optimistic. They think their housing policies are winners. They are remarkably averse to the actual evidence. Clearly this policy position is driving some Greens voters away, while it may be attracting a smaller number of new voters. This means you would predict a filtering process where greens voters over time are more aligned to the radical tax and housing policies. Yet a Resolve poll in the past month showed that among current Greens voters, less than half support the central plank of the housing policy which means they also don't support the way the policy claims to be financed. If there are so many Greens voters with such doubts about the housing policy, I'd say the Green vote has not hit the bottom yet. It is a debacle. Any other political party would have reacted. But the Greens are in ongoing denial. Perhaps when they lose those Brisbane federal seats reality will dawn. Normally the self interest of MPs who don't want to lose has some effect. Since the policy problems start in Brisbane maybe yesterday will focus some minds. Not that I care. Dysfunctional Greens makes it easier for the ALP to focus on the centre which makes Dutton's strategy harder. Overall the Queensland election was good news for moderate voters overall ... The ALP was always going to lose, too little too late on regional issues. The 50c public transport fares are great but they're a big FU to regional voters. That was a save Brisbane policy. Back to the Greens, I'd say they have three problems: 1) Their traditional voter base is highly educated, highly paid public sector progressive voters, who are soft left but probably not so inclined to support large increases in income tax 2) They have assumed that renters will vote for a party which is promising to institutionalise renting in government-owned housing as a life-long housing outcome. Actually a lot of renters think that sucks. This would only be attractive if there was no alternative. That's the problem with taking extreme positions; you might highlight the problem but lose out to more moderate solutions. And on the way to this socialist nightmare, they will force investors out of the market, which 90% of independent experts say will increase rents. It seems that renters are having doubts about the Green position. 3) They have embarked on a campaign to win Muslim voters by taking a progressive position on Palestine. Personally, I think this is legitimate; someone has to represent these voters. But the Greens are the last party to have natural appeal to religiously conservative voters (of any religion). One moment they are denouncing Israel as colonisers (yay!), the next they are telling your school principals that they must accept gay teachers and trans students, not so yay.
59. 1-2% of the population are vegan too... imagine if all the vegans were all living in one location... actually, I kind of like that idea.
60. You are asking for an Upper House. Labor are very proud of getting rid of the Upper House. This would allow the Greens, One Nation and other minority groups to have a say in Government. But. It would reduce the control of Queensland Gov by Labor, and to a lesser extent LNP.
61. But how many seats actually had a KAP candidate? Hard to draw statewide conclusions if KAP had candidates in say 10 seats compared to greens in most of them. How many of those One Nation votes would have gone to KAP if there was a candidate there? How many of those LNP votes would have gone to KAP if there was a candidate there?
62. Live your life without mining for a day.
63. Well mining companies took a huge L when they lost the referendum.
64. Exactly why I changed my vote from previously Green to ALP.
65. Yeah I preferenced Greens last election but Labor this election because I felt they were obstructionist on housing, which is a key issue to me.
66. This is such a tired line. A minor party with negotiating power uses their leverage to push the party in power to be more progressive. If they simply capitulated without negotiating they might as well not be there. But because the major parties have all the media and ideological dominance, they can trot out these lines again and again, and people will believe them. Your claims about the Greens policy and focus can be unravelled by paying any attention to their endless messaging and policy platform on housing, climate, cost of living etc. The Labor party is incentivised through receiving corporate donations to not make the most progressive reforms possible. But they will deflect responsibility onto the Greens because they are their progressive opponents competing over that voter base. The Greens who do not take corporate donations on principle, have no incentive to privilege business interests over the public and community interest. But they will have to keep eating shit from Labor who keep blaming their losses on the Greens despite the Greens having little power and Labor having most of the power.
67. That and Miles brand of Labor had many policies that appealed to Greens voters.
68. It sounds like folks were using federal greens as a reason not to vote qld greens and yet doing the opposite for Labor (when fed labor is now clearly centre/centre-right). Minor parties held to a different standard
69. It sounds like folks were using federal greens as a reason not to vote qld greens and yet doing the opposite for Labor (when fed labor is now clearly centre/centre-right). Minor parties held to a different standard
70. More broadly, people want politicians to be problem solvers, not “activists”.
71. That last line...🤣
72. What about the people who care about gay aboriginals for Palestine? Who will represent our interests now?
73. Damn 'I don't like minorities so that's why they lost votes' is your logic? Ain't know one believes for a second you're talking in any good faith.
74. This. I support Greens policies, but a large chunk of their representatives are loonies and losers.
75. Did he lose his seat, or was that the product of tired and wishful thinking on the part of the TV commentariat? I didn’t vote Greens and that’s not my electorate so I don’t have skin in the game. but it doesn’t seem clear to me at all, and the ABC’s latest commentary puts Greens ahead.
76. Strong how?
77. The ECQ [current 2PP has Berkman ahead](https://results.elections.qld.gov.au/SGE2024/maiwar/indicative) @ 51.1%. Maybe the commentariat have an inkling that the votes yet to be counted will trend towards LNP?
78. Nothing sad about that at all.
79. [Michael Berkman was re-elected, although there was a swing against him.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-26/michael-berkman-discusses-the-greens-vote-this/104522394)
80. They’re the social justice warrior party now The only green thing they care about is the shade in their hair
81. They have been constantly pushing for Labor and Liberal to stop opening new coalmines, and talked about funding their housing and cost of living policies through coal mining royalties and making mining companies pay their share in taxes... that is clearly environmental policy. What are 'woofy hand wavy' issues to you?
82. Would you rather no one called for more social housing and that coal and gas continue to get away with ripping queenslanders off? The Greens represent their voters, and their voters care about more than just the climate crisis. When both major parties refuse to make evidence-based policy to improve our lives, the Greens have to step up and show how it can be done. Without them we wouldn’t have free dentist appointments for children, 50c transport locked in, $3bil direct funding for social and community housing, the right to disconnect from work, and a bunch more
83. They support communist ideals under the facade of caring for the environment. They should change their colour to red because there is nothing green about the Greens!
84. My thoughts exactly
85. 'I'm a single issue voter who sees the rights of minorities as 'woofy hand wavy things'.
86. i would vote for a proper environmentalist party, but this gay communism nonsense they're shilling now is getting stale
87. sorry to disappoint you. that description belongs to the greens party in previous years. the current greens are a hard-core marxist/ maoist party with a very thin green outer-layer.
88. Agree. The Australian Greens wanting Labor to interfere with the RBA and artificially lower interest rates was the final nail in the coffin for me.
89. The flame against MCM is media drivel. He runs school lunches and community meals out of his own salary constantly, helped negotiate an additional 3B$ for housing, and has constantly otherwise been pushing for Labor to be better, which is what bothers Labor. Once the media start going after your personality as viciously as they have in this instance, that's an indicator you've done something right because it means you're challenging the political establishment in a real way. Unfortunately you will be punished for it.
90. The fact that Labor adopted progressive policy is part of why the greens have 0 seats currently
91. I am desperate for actual progress and practical outcomes. But that is not Labor's housing policy. I have met no one that thinks their policies will bring housing costs to income ratios back to a reasonable level within the next 20 to 30 years. If what you are doing is too little to make a difference for people for their entire working lives, forever locking them out of owning their own home, and probably their children and their children beyond them because of a lack of generational equity, then you aren't fixing the problem. You are instead putting forth performative policies designed to look like you are helping when in reality you are only helping a very small number of people who are like lottery winners while everyone else just has their housing costs continue to increase.
92. The Teals are referred to by their correct name in Queensland - The Karens
93. If there was true proportional representation then this would not be an issue. Preferential voting with "notional" voters in the large rural seats is better than First Past the Post, but not by much.
94. Fair observation. One of the difficulties for the Greens is that renters, a good part of their voting base, have increasingly high turnover in this terrible housing market. The Greens have an uphill battle on this front.
95. What a load of rocking horse shit
