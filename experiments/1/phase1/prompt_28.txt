Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. we will never agree because we fundamentally disagree on the concept of conception. we will never agree because i will ALWAYS prioritise the women giving birth over the possibility of a child, you don’t seem to even consider the mother at all. you compare having an abortion it to murder and rape without the consideration of what pregnancy does to a woman’s body and soul, and you don’t care that illegal abortions out of desperation frequently kill the women attempting them because you don’t care about life, you care about forcing women to be incubators. outlawing abortions for personal reasons over medical reasons makes them harder for people who medically need them, which you seem to care about but not actually because all the research suggests any abortion bans make medically necessary abortions significantly harder to access. you care about the potential life but not actually because i have seen very little protest from the pro-forced birth community to increase community services to help new mothers and to fix the foster system. With domestic violence on the rise in australia with little being done about it by our government, one of the worst things i can imagine is banning abortions and forcing more children to grow up in violent and broken households. nothing you say, no pathetic attempts at poking holes in my beliefs will get me to change my stance on this.
2. Mate, thankyou, for so been openly honest how you view abortions, because your real window into area alot of us don't understand, be a sexist prick who only view women in the window of making babies. Cheers
3. Good thing there's no baby to kill in any of those examples then :)
4. Are you playing dumb on purpose, or are you actually just this stupid? You're a misogynist for wanting to take the right to reproductive healthcare away from women. Literally nothing to do with the sex of the babies?? 'Forced birth' refers to forcing pregnant women to carry a foetus, that they want to abort, to term. Whether or not the conception was consensual is completely irrelevant to that discussion, keep up No fully grown babies are being aborted, when will you people stop spreading this obvious lie? Late term abortions only make up a tiny fraction of terminations (literally 1-2%) and are only done when the foetus is incompatible with life or the mother's life is at immediate risk. These abortions are almost always on wanted pregnancies- no one is suffering through 5+ months of pregnancy just to change their mind and get an abortion on a whim. Over 90% of terminations are done before 14 weeks and at that point, the foetus is closer to a mole than a fully grown baby lol. Have you ever seen a foetus at that stage? Not to be crude, but it's literally a blob with vague limb and head shapes that is indistinguishable from animal foetuses at similar stages. If you think that's equivalent to a live newborn baby, you need to get your eyes checked because they're completely different. I know which one you'd save from a burning building if you were forced to choose, and it wouldn't be the foetus.
5. The mothers life is always at risk with pregnancy, though. That's the point. Pregnancy is dangerous, even when it goes well. Me? I had a textbook healthy pregnancy. And then in labor, my daughter got stuck on my pelvis and had to be manually pulled out of my body by a doctor, causing me to haemmorage and nearly die. Which was unfortunate because it triggered a post-partum pre-ecclampsia seizure. Which again caused me to almost die. So now, remind me. Why is it okay to force a woman to use her body to keep someone else alive - when in no other situation that is legal or okay?
6. Again you and the point make a huge leap yet again but go off on wanting to control women’s bodies babe.
7. It’s crazy you’re still talking to me and can’t detect a troll when you’re talking to one. I brought up cum on a cookie and you think this is a battle of wits? Regardless I’m glad I changed your mind and you’re now pro abortion!
8. >you don’t care that illegal abortions out of desperation frequently kill the women attempting them because you don’t care about life Whose life? >ALWAYS prioritise the women giving birth over the possibility of a child It's not a possible child, it's a child. Why is there a conflict when the mother and baby are healthy? >we will never agree because we fundamentally disagree on the concept of conception. We do agree that it is unforgivable to kill a baby. That is why you are trying to pretend that an abortion is not the killing of a baby. Funnily enough, no-one is just outright saying it is fine to kill babies, cuz that would be insane to everyone. But fudging around with the issue and lying, that makes it okay, that makes it all better. >outlawing abortions for personal reasons over medical reasons makes them harder for people who medically need them Same as how euthanasia is tricky cuz awful people will take advantage of legal euthanasia to kill old people who don't want to die, either cuz they can't be bothered caring for them or want to take their money. Funny how awful people ruin it for everyone else. >the pro-forced birth community That's a lie, we're not discussing rape here. If it's rape or there are medical issues, fine. But when it is a healthy consensual pregnancy, there is no force. You're using exaggerated language because honest language means you lose the argument. >With domestic violence on the rise in australia with little being done about it by our government, one of the worst things i can imagine is banning abortions and forcing more children to grow up in violent and broken households. Your solution to protect children from domestic violence is to kill them? You cannot be serious.
9. Humans need to eat, sleep, find shelter and have children in order to stay alive. Having babies used to be considered a good thing, not a curse. This bizarre antinatalism that has taken grip of society is only going to end badly. After all, it's not like those aborted babies are going to have any rights or choices, since they died in the womb. People like you who only view babies as a clump of cells to be disposed like a bag of rubbish are not sexist, so what is the word? Something bad. There must be a word for that. Homicidal? Ah! Infanticidal. You are infanticidal.
10. Why? Are you against killing of babies? You just made 2 pro-abortion posts.
11. >You're a misogynist for wanting to take the right to reproductive healthcare away from women. Literally nothing to do with the sex of the babies?? It is not healthcare to kill a healthy baby consensually conceived, any more than it is healthcare to kill a healthy elderly person who want to live. And it is "literally" nothing to do with misogyny. Any man involved in the infanticide is awful too. >'Forced birth' refers to forcing pregnant women to carry a foetus, that they want to abort, to term. Whether or not the conception was consensual is completely irrelevant to that discussion, keep up Forced birth is forcing a woman to get pregnant, aka rape. When a woman has consensual sex there is no force involved. You're using these dishonest terms to try to justify the killing of babies for no reason. If parents try to kill their 10 year old child, and they are prevented from doing so, we don't refer to that as "forced parenthood". It's just unbelievably dishonest language from your infanticide mindset. >No fully grown babies are being aborted, when will you people stop spreading this obvious lie? I haven't said anything about fully grown babies. Stop being dishonest. >Over 90% of terminations are done before 14 weeks and at that point, the foetus is closer to a mole than a fully grown baby lol. A foetues is never anything like a mole. No-one is protesting dermatologist clinics, trying to dissuade people from having their moles removed. Again, just constant dishonesty from the infanticide mindset.
12. So you think that haemorrhaging during delivery and then having a seizure is things going well? That's not normal. Most women do not experience that. You had a bad experience. It sucks, and it is good that you survived. If you knew then what you know now, that you would haemorrhage, but with no guarantee of survival, would you still have gone through with your pregnancy? Was your daughter worth it? You talk about force, but we're not talking about rape here, only healthy pregnancies conceived consensually. And of course you seem to be overlooking the fact that if everyone keeps aborting their pregnancies, there won't be any people left soon. For now abortion cultures like Australia are keeping their populations going by importing people from non-abortion cultures. What happens if the whole world adopts the same attitude? Where are we going to import people from then, other planets? I suppose we'll find out soon.
13. Was never not Im just not going pretend a protest for a problem that doesn’t exist isn’t being attended by complete and utter fucktards . If I had to guess your probably a lesbian who protests for Palestinians but if you went there they would stone you to death. Time to check back in to the mental health clinic Ivy
14. i agree with the accepted scientific term that a fertilised egg is an embryo once implanted in the uterus walls, that embryo is a fetus at the ~10 week mark, and that this fetus isn’t a baby until it is able to independently take its first breath outside the womb, which funnily enough is also the Australian governments legal timeline. in no cases on abortions do i believe a baby is being killed. you see a healthy 8week pregnancy in the same regard as a 20week pregnancy and that makes zero sense from a developmental and biological standpoint. sure i’ve used baby to refer to a fetus, but from a biological and legal standpoint they arnt the same. If you seriously see a fetus in the same light as a two year old, you are insane, sure a healthy fetus has the potential to become a two year old, but so does the egg my body decides to pass every once in a while.
15. Shocking! Local woman cares about her right to access reproductive healthcare!
16. You’re more than welcome to carry to term when you get pregnant mate.
17. A problem that doesn’t exist… for YOU. This very well could be a problem for other people, you know, people who own a uterus. But it’s not a problem for you, so why should anyone care right? Everyone should just shut up and stay home and not share their thoughts about anything I guess. It makes me happy that you are so pissed about people protesting, makes me want to go block traffic even more. It’s pretty weird that you’ve stalked me but I guess I hit a nerve and you couldn’t help yourself. Btw do you often get angry at lesbians online? Is it because you know they won’t fuck you? I’m not actually a lesbian I’m bisexual, but that has nothing to do with me advocating for stopping the genocide because unlike you I am capable of understanding that LGBT+ rights aren’t really issue No.1 when you are being bombed in your home. Anyway I hope you continue to be mad at lesbians and protests. You really do sound like a grumpy old boomer it’s quite funny
18. >If you seriously see a fetus in the same light as a two year old, you are insane, sure a healthy fetus has the potential to become a two year old, but so does the egg my body decides to pass every once in a while. There are scientific terms for many subtle stages of a baby's in utero development, that doesn't stop it from being a baby. A foetus is not the same as an unfertilised egg. The egg will only become a born child with action. The foetus will only die with action, unless there is a miscarriage. So in fact the chances are diametrically opposed.
19. Killing someone is not healthcare. It is only healthcare when a person with an illness or injury is being euthanised.
20. It doesn’t exist because they never said that and nor will do it. You cant help but make lies out of everything where is the anger at lesbians?? Mentioning the word lesbian apparently is received as a hate speech to the simple. And you’re no bisexual if no one wants you you’re just un lovable
21. hate to say it bud but the fetus can’t live independently, the mother has to take action to keep it alive, literally why there are so many health checkups involved with pregnancies and checking development and why things like diets, halting substance use, and physical activity are so important. obviously there is a difference between unfertilised eggs and fertilised eggs but still neither of them are a baby. *edit legally there isn’t life until the fetus can live independently from the mother, that isn’t my opinion that is the legal requirement for life in australia, can’t kill something that isn’t alive.
22. holy shit, you managed to contradict yourself in just 2 sentences, congrats! 'killing someone is not healthcare, except for when it is' is not the brilliant insight you clearly thought it was. it's actually kind of a pro-abortion argument when you think about it, lmfao. god, the forced-birther brains trust clearly isn't sending their best, huh?
23. I mean you’re the one fantasising about me getting stoned to death. And yet I’m the unlovable one 🤣🤣🤣
24. bTW you saying youre thinking about them stoning me to death was the hate speech, not the lesbian part. Its crazy how dumb you have to be to not realise that
25. The pregnancy healthcare stuff is just to minimize the risk of problems. If the mother does nothing but keep herself healthy, the baby will 100% be born unless there is a miscarriage. So, no action means a new life. Versus an unfertilized egg, where no action means no new life. You can't hide behind legal definitions, the law says all kinds of untrue things. [Legal fiction - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Legal_fiction&oldid=1245886902) And the law permits all kinds of awful things too.
26. **Did you read the explanatory notes of the amendment? You didn't did you lmao ill help you out, no one is forcing births or canceling any abortions.... This is soley regarding fetus' as you say independently living outside the mothers post abortion.... I.e not fetus but >Babies<** **"**babies born as a result of a termination of pregnancy procedure. babies born as a result of a termination of pregnancy procedure.**"** **"**The bill removes any doubt that babies **born in these circumstances** are entitled to the same degree of medical care and attention as a baby born in any other way.**"** >hate to say it bud but the fetus can’t live independently, the mother has to take action to keep it alive This is very true as by definition the fetus is inside the mother, once the fetus is outside its not a fetus, now its a baby. And idk what argument your making as independent life soley means the baby has taken a breath. Laymans independent living? well,... Yeah um you'd struggle to find even a 5 year old that could live independent. Without action taken from parents... You know that's why he have criminal neglect charges against parents, because children require external care and attention or they well they face horrible outcomes. >legally there isn’t life until the fetus can live independently from the mother Well Yes that means the baby inhales the atmosphere once outside the body of the mother. The *"Under Australian law, a life is recognised at the point when there is* [*independence from the mother*](https://www.judicialcollege.vic.edu.au/media/837/file)*. This means the child becomes a legal person when the child can take its first independent breath, otherwise known as the “born alive rule”."* **So what you're saying is you agree with LNP and think the following is morally abhorrent. I don't think you read the proposed concerns lmao as, All they desire is babies that are alive outside of the mother to not just be left to die, You're saying so much about the dangers of pregnancy et.c but these are no longer a risk to the mother as the fetus is now a premature living neonate desperately clinging to life and being left to die (as alive = alive\[I'd hope you wont change the alive definition now again\])** A known case of a pre-viable baby born alive and left to die in Queensland is that of Xanthe.6 Unexpectedly born alive at 19 weeks after an abortion at the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital, Xanthe was left to die alone for seven minutes without being held.7 In 2018, a study reported in the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology reviewed 241 late-term abortions without feticide on babies between 20-24 weeks gestation and found that more than half the babies were born alive, with a median time of survival of 32 minutes and one baby surviving for over four hours (267 minutes).8 *6 Jackie Sinnerton, “Hospital failures pushed my wife over the edge”, The Sunday Mail, 6 August 2023.* *7 Ibid.* *8 Stephanie Springer et al, ‘Fetal Survival in Second-Trimester Termination of Pregnancy without Feticide’ (2018) 131(3) Obstetrics & Gynaecology 575.* [*https://documents.parliament.qld.gov.au/tp/2024/5724T411-9FFD.pdf*](https://documents.parliament.qld.gov.au/tp/2024/5724T411-9FFD.pdf) Every argument you've made is quite literally irrelevant to the actual amendment lmao....
27. Healthcare only applies to the ill and injured. You understand this? It is not a difficult concept. To simply kill a perfectly healthy person is just the act of killing. It is not in any way healthcare. Serial killers are not doctors. Do you understand? There is no force involved in healthy consensually conceived pregnancies, and no healthcare involved in the killing of such babies. You cannot tell the truth about your position for the simple reason that your position is infanticidal. Take a good long hard look in the mirror. Think about what you have become.
28. I know this must be the most anyone has ever talked to you. But don’t worry its only because your personality sux. Good talk
29. You need to learn to read
30. law, and biology buddy. a women “keeping herself healthy” is taking action. an elite athlete choosing to have a baby is going to lead a very different lifestyle then she normally does, as would many different women from many different walks of life. my mother took the action to quite smoking when she was pregnant, many women stop drinking, avoid raw fish and certain foods. I know many women who had to be hospitalised in the lead up to their births for many different reasons, if they hadn’t acted and gotten medical intervention many of those fetus wouldnt have been born. i’m a twin, my brother and i were born months premature via C-section as my umbilical cord was wrapped around his throat and he was lacking vital nutrients without that medical intervention we both would have likely died, and my mother would have likely never been able to natural expel our remains. shows how very little you know of pregnancy to assume that 100% of women who lead healthy lives give birth to healthy babies (unless they have a miscarriage), thousands of premie babies die in the NICU after they are born from a plethora of different things, SIDs is a fairly common phenomenon, as are developmental defects that are never found in screenings or on scans. pregnant women are taking actions literally every step of their pregnancy, i don’t see how taking a pill to kill a bundle of cells that haven’t existed for more then a month is an action but choosing to have your body ripped apart months early to hopefully save one of your dying fetus isn’t, i feel sorry for your mother that you seriously think pregnancy is a walk in the park as long as you’re healthy 😒
31. Are you a doctor? Because I can assure you the 'healthcare stuff' is a lot more complicated than you think. There is no such thing as a free baby. The physiological changes during pregnancy are dramatic, and can exacerbate or reveal underlying health problems in the mother. Not to mention the innumerable potential pregnancy complications which can put the life of both mother and foetus at risk. Ever heard of preeclampsia? Placenta praevia? Massive post-partum haemorrhage? GBS infection? If you answered 'yes' then you would understand that no baby is guaranteed until they are pink and crying. Denying adequate healthcare and bodily autonomy based on an argument of 'babies just happen' is completely indefensible from a medical (or any educated) standpoint. If the answer was 'no', then maybe you have no clue what is and isn't safe in childbirth. And just maybe you should shut your mouth about things you don't understand.
32. A baby that doesn’t have severe medical issues will not die naturally in 32 minutes. Babies terminated because they have severe defects not compatible with life should be allowed minimal suffering and their parents should be allowed to hold them and love them for those 32 minutes, not have them taken away and given forceful measures and hooked up to machines that will only prolong suffering and not give them meaningful life (if they are born without part of their brain or no kidneys etc). Just as it is cruel to insist on rib breaking CPR for elderly cancer patients, who can say they Do not want these measures but want to die peacefully.
33. Oh I know it’s been a good talk for you because you’re fantasising about stoning me. Psychopath
34. If I had to guess you’re probably a lesbian who protests for Palestinians but if you went there they would stone you to death. How many times would you like me to read the part where you fantasise about me getting stoned to death?
35. >I know many women who had to be hospitalised in the lead up to their births for many different reasons, if they hadn’t acted and gotten medical intervention many of those fetus wouldnt have been born. Highly reliable sourced data set, I'm actually amazed that someone with so much concern about these laws seriously didn't take the fucking time to actually read the explanatory notes of the amendment. >i were born months premature via C-section as my umbilical cord was wrapped around his throat and he was lacking vital nutrients without that medical intervention we both would have likely died Whats wild is LNP are actually advocating for people in your situation essentially but instead it would be phrased without the "C-section" and with "termination", Unless you think once you were removed from your c-section and needed healthcare but your parent said "nah we not want" you should be excluded health care and left to die. (again not forcing the life onto a mother... but just providing medical care to a pre mature neonate; like you were once apon a time) *This Guideline stipulates that in instances where a “baby is born with signs of life and survival is determined to be unlikely,” the guidelines state that “active treatment” is not recommended. The Guideline suggests a range of other best practices including the establishment of “local procedures for the management of live birth,” including offering counselling and other services to parents, handling the baby gently and wrapping to provide warmth and offering parents opportunities to engage in care provision such as cuddling/holding. If parents do not wish to be involved in palliative care provision, the Guidelines stipulate that healthcare providers “may provide comfort support strategies”.11* *While the present iteration of the Guideline is an improvement on the previous version which stipulated that “if a live birth occurs…do not provide life-sustaining treatment”, there remain ambiguities which require addressing. First, if a live birth occurs following a termination and the baby has no life-limiting condition and is on the threshold of viability (ie. after 22 weeks and 6 days) or older, it should be clearly stipulated that life-sustaining medical care should be provided to the child irrespective of parents’ wishes.*
