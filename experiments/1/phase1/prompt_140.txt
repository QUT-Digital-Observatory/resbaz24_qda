Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. You know, it's hard to know whether you're engaging in good faith here. Have a think about what sort of scan was done at 20 weeks... Up until that point, it's impossible to detect many types of foetal abnormality and the 22 week cut off is to allow for this. Women do not get pregnant and then get up one day at almost 5 months pregnant and go "You know what, I don't wanna be pregnant anymore. I'm going to yeet this foetus". To even think that is remotely what's happening shows an alarming lack of consideration of who is actually obtaining this kind of procedure. In addition to that, abortion access is **far** from adequate in Queensland, especially for rural and remote women, plenty of who may not even find out they're pregnant within the previously legal time frame. Decriminalisation of abortion is the surest way to keep the procedure safe and the stats bear that out. It is not up to you or I to impose moral judgement on situations we are simply not involved in, and it is arrogant to throw out blanket judgement of "evil" when you've had a small cursory glance at the issue at hand. This is not something you'll personally go through, yet you seem perfectly entitled to weigh in with those kinds of statements. It would be advantageous for you to continue to research this topic, defer to professionals within the medical field, defer to women who've personal experience of the matter and educate yourself on the realities of what we're actually talking about here. [I encourage you to start here at "Children by Choice"](https://www.childrenbychoice.org.au/organisational-information/legislation/queensland-abortion-law/) I'm going to now gracefully bow out of this conversation because I've done enough ground work for you, I'm not convinced you're engaging in good faith and frankly, you have a **long** way to go before you fully understand the issue at hand. I hope you continue to educate yourself more thoroughly on the topic.
2. Seems rather like a good way to get rid of an inconvenience. Easy route to go down I guess.... if it would harm the safety of the females life, yes. But sure why not make it up until birth? Wild.
3. **Ahhh, and there it is.** You've thrown in all the clich√©s because you just don't want to know the truths. "An inconvenience", "easy route", "females", "sure why not make it up until birth". This is a pathetic take and you sound just like all the other uneducated loud mouths who live entirely by their feelings instead of actual facts. üôÑ Bad faith, indeed.
4. Well why not? There really is no difference? My personal opinion is that I would never support it but if someone else isn't hurting me I wouldn't hurt them. For example I wouldn't treat someone differently if they aborted at 6 week or 40 weeks. Their choice and not my life. The law does interest me but Im not the one making the law and I wouldn't want the job doing so. Probably no need to name call. I do find it interesting that when discussing the effective end-of-life of a being people can try and take the moral high ground, once again, wild.
5. You call it name calling, I'm just not pandering to you and decided to just tell you how you sound. Don't want anyone to say it, then, I dunno, don't act like it. Late term abortions have strict conditions on them for goodness sake and in a general sense, they are performed as an act of compassion for a suffering foetus or to point blank save the life of the mother. Go look at the statistics and stop wasting time on here. Do you even know what you think anyway? You called it evil, the easy way out and act like women are just going to yeet much wanted pregnancies for shits and giggles, then say you wouldn't judge/treat someone differently for their choices. You went on the "moral high ground". Make up your mind. ETA: You've also conveniently ignored all of the information I've given you here so really, I was right to refer you to Google in the first place. Sealion bullshit tbh.
6. Yeah name call and then explain it away. Not something I value. Anyone who kills another person is evil imo. Each to their own.
7. Sealioning is a pathetic tactic. You should have just been honest and started with this.
8. My FIL said that he had a labor politician come to their seniors forum and said that he had ‚Äúsome really good policies that made them think‚Äù but voted for liberal because he‚Äôs always voted liberal üôÑ.
9. It is likely we never hear of the 'youth crime' issue again. Many who were in social professions or justice 10 years are not surprised by what's going on in regards to regional crime etc. Newman, Crisafulli, Bleijie etc. were warned back then their actions would lead Qld to where it is now - this included things like cutting the police force, dismantling the sentencing review commission, education and program cuts. It often takes more than a single political term for the trends to emerge as well, and LNP know this. So now, the LNP have the chance to atone for the mess they left 10 years ago. It's highly likely they won't. Crisafulli may not be Newman, he might even believe his words last night, but he's taken power with a bunch of people who could really make leadrship very difficult and in turn, him very unpopular - including Bleijie and Stoker. The LNP fully know that the youth crime is trending down overall. Good politics would be to just ride it out, and as it continues downard, claim it was their work that enabled this. Any cuts/negative actions they take will really only be felt once they leave gov, and they can then blame Labor. They fully know that the population has short memories, and the media will play right into this in the name of response and engagement. As for the areas where youth crime is problematic (like Townsville): if history of LNP and even general politics is anything to go by, as the solution requires complex integrated policy, it's probably not going to happen. Hope this is proven wrong, but it's likely you've been had. Make sure you let them know.
10. "Queensland has chosen hope over fear," says a party whose majority of the campaign was run on baseless talk about crime.
11. This is the reason liberal have been destroying public education for the last 40 years. Same direction as USA but not quite as stupid yet.
12. I'll just be saying "Thank God we voted for LNP" every time I hear someone bitching about their costs hurting them. Unfortunately it does look like people need to eat shit for a whole term to know how good they had it. I am looking forward to seeing Miles as an opposition leader if he stays.
13. Yet these LNP towns will be the first to demand metro standard healthcare and expect life flight to pick them up. Let‚Äôs see how they go over the next 4 years
14. They are going to create a whole new govt department to save them money and that will save us $7bn/yr. That‚Äôs a piss take right? It has to be. People are so stupid.
15. Agree with all your points mate. What sort of POS says no to feeding children? Charging mining companies their fair share?
16. Lets just reflect on all the dumbarse things the Newman govt did last time LNP were in Govt. https://independentaustralia.net/wordpress-opt/wp-content/2013/01/aaaaLIST-of-CUTS-to-PUBLIC-COMMUNITY-SERVICES-JOBS-13-01-13.pdf
17. Feel sorry for all the kids that have to go through searches at school and getting locked up instead of actual policies to prevent crime in the first place. Have fun paying for that QLD... and the generation of trauma that the LNP will create through such archaic policies.
18. The privileged people will be happy, their mining shares will go up. The people that need it wont get bugger all. I‚Äôm pretty sure the power rebate and 50 cent travel was funding via the mining taxes? Rich people dont need the power rebate or cheap transport, although you can be sure they took it
19. How very Joh of Queensland.
20. im very disappointed that libs won, such a huge step backwards for the state.
21. Also, did 56k people (and counting) really vote for fucking Katter??? Ugh....
22. I am also a first time Labor voter and have never been more invested in an election only to come out on the losing side. The people of this great state are a disappointment.
23. Why does it feel like Australia is about to enter its Trump era? I'm genuinely scared about what happens next.
24. It's actually crazy how much the pre-poll votes sent LNP over the line. Given the election day votes were much less pro-LNP I wonder how many pre-poll voters changed their minds after voting?
25. I love it though, "Too much spending" when Queensland has been in continuous budget _surplus_ in the last few years thanks to QLD Labor. It's the way the LNP spins things that makes me sick.
26. The problem with Queensland is that it's such a big state and the majority of population is effected by the north
27. It's not Crisafool, it's Chris-a-full-of-shit. I live in Townsville. Not only did the city vote in Troy Thompson and are now shocked he's a dick, they turned our three Labor seats over to the LNP and made Robbie Katter influential. I'm should be shocked but Murdoch media has been too influential yet again
28. the "facts don't care about your feelings" crowd really showed us!
29. I reckon the coal industry must be crackin‚Äô the Mo√´t over this result.
30. Never forget that posts like this express a monority of Quennslanders. Here are the election results as a breakdown of the total number of Queenslanders. https://results.elections.qld.gov.au/SGE2024 All because you are louder, it does mean you represent everyone.
31. Never forget that posts like this express a monority of Quennslanders. Have a look at the election results as a breakdown of the total Queensladers (Google the election results from the ecq.qld website) All because you are louder, it does mean you represent everyone.
32. I guess Queenslanders hate children and they hate women.
33. Hehe
34. The 50cent fares were a election buy The other things would never have happened anyway
35. Say hello to higher energy costs! üëã The LNP plan to privatise the energy sector. South Australia privatised their energy sector in 1999 and their bills are 40% more expensive on average. Prepare to come up with more money for electricity, especially considering the cost of living rebate will go too ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Absolute idiocy
36. Have a tantrum mate
37. You're obviously so small mined that you can't accept that people have a valid but different view than yourself. What are you, 12 years old?
38. No one will say goodbye to free school lunches that never saw light of day. Stop talking nonsense dude. It‚Äôs pathetic. It‚Äôs 4 years. You‚Äôll survive just fine. Then Labor comes back in and you can have a wank. Grow up.
39. Labour üñïüëã LNPüëèüí™
40. The amount of salt in this thread is completely off the charts.
41. Lol .. salty much. I haven't heard this much bleating since marking last year.
42. God damn this place is an echo chamber Labor had been in for what almost 18 years of the last 22 clearly the people wanted change and voted as such that doesn't mean you need to cry. Completely logical considering the state/country are pretty well fucked ATM to try something different. I imagine most of the people here are too young to even remember a Newman government the public service was bloated AF and we needed a razor man yes he pushed too hard and ended up being one term. Hopefully it sends a message to federal Labor to pull their socks up if they can because lord help Reddit when Dutton beats Albo which is tracking.
43. I have zero idea how I will find a Grand out of thin air to fund the electric next year. Grim Austerity ahead.
44. And goodbye to preferential voting. Here we Joh again.
45. Doesnt matter who wins. The system is shit no matter what.
46. Never seen so many salty tears after a state election.
47. Sounds like you voted for ALP because they bought you with their free lunches, cheap transport and energy rebates.
48. Lol
49. Lol do you like the inflation? Keep allowing a government to overspend like labor does. You labor clowns are all the same it‚Äôs hilarious
50. Lol do you like the inflation? Keep allowing a government to overspend like labor does. You labor clowns are all the same it‚Äôs hilarious
51. Where labor really lost was in the regions All we see outside the south east is our money going to somewhere else and we are treated with absolute disdain. My electorate was labor for over 100 years, but the last 10 years of neglect and an absolute dud member cost labor almost a 20 percent swing Politicians have to learn that there are consequences for their lack of support
52. Just think about what‚Äôs going on in other parts of the world when you are complaining about no more free lunch for kids. If you can‚Äôt afford kids don‚Äôt have them. Fool. Everyone wants a hand out
53. Question for mainly ALP voters, things hardly change between governments in Queensland. Why is this the election that has set the house on fire?
54. Is this r/Queensland or r/laborpartyofaustralia
55. The old dumbcunts, also i wonder if the youngers went out to vote or are they still thinking it doesnt make a difference. Ffs
56. Have you tried whining on the internet to resolve your problem?
57. Well already broken his first election promise before the polls even opened.
58. ‚Ä¶but the ‚ÄúYouth Crime!!!‚Äù - Boomers reading Newscorpse papers and watching Sky News.
59. [deleted]
60. I‚Äôm so disappointed. Other voters in Queensland are morons. I‚Äôm now extremely concerned about my job in healthcare, but according to the public, Nurse, Doctors and support staff are all lazy.
61. A lot of very salty Queenslanders here. Kleenex stocks are going to surge!
62. Too many brain dead cunts in this country smh
63. Aaaawww, did someone lose an election?
64. It's almost as if we live in a democracy. Your team loses you get angry, your team wins you are happy. Move on and be grateful that we have a great voting system that works
65. Sounds like a lot of whining brats who didn‚Äôt get their way
66. I guess reddit votes don't count eh guys?
67. Let‚Äôs be real. They‚Äôre all shit.
68. Cry some more.
69. Cope harder this sub is in shambles. The people have voted. Get over it and be thankful that in 4 years time you can vote again for who you think should be in.
70. Boy, Reddit is salty today It's almost as if people got mugged by reality
71. So the people voted but you‚Äôre not happy about it? Feel free to move. In the meantime this is democracy. Like it or not this is what the people have decided.
72. Never forget that posts like this express a monority of Quennslanders. Here are the election results as a breakdown of the total number of Queenslanders. https://results.elections.qld.gov.au/SGE2024 All because you are louder, it does mean you represent everyone.
73. You‚Äôre fucked if you do, you‚Äôre fucked if you don‚Äôt. They are all lairs, they don‚Äôt care about you. They care about themselves. Preferential voting is a scam.
74. Is there a way we can avoid this happening again? I don't know, like a website that could track policies and promises made by the government in a way that's easy to understand? It seems to me that this was an election won by messaging (whether it's correct or not, that's besides the point).
75. Thanks, feel pretty good tbh.
76. You reap what you sow.
77. ü§£
78. Labor had been in power for 3 terms, 10 years. A lot of people felt it was time for a change.
79. You vote a party in, not a person as the premier.
80. Feel you OP. First time voted Labor since Kevin ‚Äò07. The media has a grip on the sheeple.
81. I fucking hate being bundled into that statement- LOTS of us didn‚Äôt vote for Scomo 2.0
82. Hey I voted labor
83. We are really fucked
84. Turns out trying buy votes and frighten people into voting for you with made up scare campaigns isn't a winning strategy, no matter how shiny your teeth are. The good people of Queensland have too much common-sense to fall for such gimmicks.
85. Seldom do you see a state vote so hard to solidify a stereotype of itself.
86. Who do you propose we vote for? I voted for one nation. Is there someone else? An independent? Maybe the greens? Or should I of voted labor? Honestly shut up you twat.
87. I read that LNP didn't get a majority of something like that. Can someone explain what that means?
88. First time I've ever voted Labor. Devastating result.
89. The energy shift is a tough topic to talk about rationally. It can't be rushed but we can't heitate either. Some of it is at a point that is maybe above the intellect of average people, which just pisses people off. This election some want power to be cheaper and others want power to be expensive for profits. What we will see over the next term is that more of the business class want cheaper, it's just a few of the really big coal heads that hold on to the old status quo hard. Coal still has its place as we transition, to effectively balance demands will take a while to get the cleaner infrastructure. Quicker is to offset with plantings of trees which is happening but never to much at this point. The energy transition will happen, it's exciting to think about the possibilities that could play out. Nuclear will be a federal issue and as someone who has been staunchly against it still would like to see the conversations and investigations take place. I'm ok if I've got it wrong and humans can do it safely.
90. No I don't consider myself a rugged individual completely devoid of benefits of society. But the attitude of a lot of Labor voters seems to be that the government is some lean efficient machine and nothing ever gets wasted. More government or services is always a good thing. I disagree. I don't want no government, but I do want minimal government that doesn't take up over 50% of the economy after fed, state and local are accounted for. Maybe if government just had less power and less money to throw around it wouldn't be such a big deal who sat in the chair, corporate lobbyists wouldn't be as prevalent, general kickbacks to pollies would diminish and what funds the government does take in can actually be focused acutely where they are needed. Including those who unfortunately for whatever reason need some help. Side tracking a bit here, but look at the NDIS as a recent example. No one begrudges those that need help from getting some but it's turned into a massive rort rife with corruption and an expense that will soon dwarf aged pension. Government needs to be smaller, more efficient and less corrupt before kill entertain the thought of supporting more responsibility to them. This goes both ways, Labor and liberal. How much are we spending on these nuclear subs? How many meals would that have paid for? Just rorts and waste everywhere
91. Is OP trolling? Sounds like a teenager‚Äôs take on politics.
92. Don't blame I voted for Kodos
93. Wait till the labors books are shown. All this pilem on projects will stuff the budget. Most projects so far are double if not tripled. They have done this over and over. 4 years later it will be about lnp making cuts not how labor hid the figures
94. Over reacting much mate? Be careful, the brown shirts will be knocking on your door soon ü§£
95. There are few things that would make me support the LNP, but ticking off the kind of people who post seething partisan spite like this all while thinking they are above reproach is one of those things.
96. None of the people you want to see this are on reddit.... You're screaming in a vaccuum chamber mate. Don't waste your energy. Go and do something meaningful with your time.
97. Also voted labour for the first time ever as someone who usually votes LNP‚Ä¶ I just didn‚Äôt trust this bloke, he dodge‚Äôs too many questions and apart from slogans, I never really seen what his policies will be‚Ä¶ Anyway, 4 years and we will see what happens next
98. CFMEU member
99. Go cry somewhere else
100. " ill-informed miscreants that voted blue ' And that is a MAJOR part of the problem. Arrogant bigots who think that they are much smarter than people with opposing views and no respect for the Democratic process. What is the number ONE problem according to many ? CRIME . It has spiralled out of control under Labor .
101. i am disappointed LNP won, but the labor had so many opportunities to be tough on crime they absolutely squandered the opportunity
102. As an LNP voter, you‚Äôre welcome ‚ò∫Ô∏è
103. Eat shit ALP *teabags*
104. Gosh i am happy liberals got in and 0 Green seats. Finally a party not distracted by woke BS. the Voice was a $400 mill waste of money and done by a government out of touch
105. Never forget that posts like this express a monority of Quennslanders. Here are the election results as a breakdown of the total number of Queenslanders. https://results.elections.qld.gov.au/SGE2024 All because you are louder, it does mean you represent everyone.

107. To be fair, energy rebates was a one time thing...we weren't ever promised ongoing energy rebates
108. I really hope LNP goes balls to the walls with how they fuck us over. Let everyone get familiar with how corrupt they are so no one forgets too quickly again.
109. ü§£ü§£
110. Just want to be clear, I‚Äôm a medium and sway liberal to labour But it‚Äôs time for change! It‚Äôs been too long, we need a breath of fresh air. We mustn‚Äôt let all the propaganda create fear and spread misinformation. Each political party will do say anything they can do win votes during their campaign.
111. *Such* a sore loser.
112. Bro chill out haha, don‚Äôt start taking on the panicked American view of politics. There is no real difference between the major parties. You‚Äôre gonna be fine.
113. Hug?
114. Sleep easy tonight mate. Remindme! 6 month
115. They don't do research, unless you count Facebook and Murdoch media. Anytime you ask an average LNP voter why they think the insane thing they said is true, they always bring it back to what was in the newspaper or a Facebook post with some Minions in it
116. A vote for the ALP is a vote for Marxism
117. You're asking people to do research who are can't be bothered to even think for themselves. Any mental effort is too much. If it isn't spoon fed by murdoch they won't know anything about it.
118. Voted one nation all the way. Happily do it again one nation one nation
119. LOL fucking Queensland. Oh well, enjoy the government that you voted for.
120. finally an end of the worst labor government in Queenslands history. Trad/palletochooks/miles away from real governance. Corrupted and controlled by the cfnmmeu
121. Are you addicted to receiving OPM, other people‚Äôs money..
122. Is cam cock the next union puppet? He‚Äôs certainly working the room this morning. Where‚Äôs the moral victor this morning?
123. Victoria is next, and about time!
124. So what is this LNP pelicans actually plan for QLD ?
125. Try Facebook dickhead, we're all labor and greens in this sub.
126. Thanks Townsville and Cairns. You couldn't control your kids and now the entire state has to suffer
127. This is some great satirical writing that will appeal to many here who pay less tax than they take in benefit. ‚ÄòFree‚Äô school lunches, 50c fares and energy rebates. Yes, wasting taxpayer funds to buy votes is one of the reasons Labor lost.
128. Lady at work the other day ‚Äúfree school lunches is a joke, who doesn‚Äôt give their kids lunch!? And besides most schools have a free breakfast program in place, miles is kidding if he thinks that will win him votes‚Äù - lady in her 50s who‚Äôs husband works in a coal mine
129. All those free things you listed aren't actually free. Nothing is "free".
130. I‚Äôve been watching war documentaries since I found out who won, because it feels like more of a future than QLD has for the next few years.
131. This LNP experience will be as bad as the last with Noddy Newman. Cost cutting, while people expect ED waiting times to improve. Hopeless.
132. State didn't give a fuck when all you blow ins made me homeless, hope you all suffer under LNP
133. welp it looks like I'm moving states. Bye Queensland, it was fun
134. 50c public transport is a joke and a cheap vote buying exercise. The sooner it‚Äôs gone the better
135. I know this is just venting but the people in far north qld who voted for this don't know what reddit is and probably can't turn on/don't own a computer
