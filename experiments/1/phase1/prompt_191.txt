Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Haha! You're hilarious.
2. The American military industrial complex is not going to stop under a trump administration. The bombs over the heads of your friends abroad are brought on by the ideology of themselves and the people around them. Consider yourself lucky it’s not you and that you live here.
3. The LNP is currently about where the Republicans were in 2010 or so. The path they took after that is instructive, hopefully as a cautionary tale, but the blueprint is the same because the same forces are behind the LNP in terms of evangelical mega-churches, Pentecostals, Murdoch, and the wealthy.
4. Unfortunately the party seems to be moving in that direction. They keep preselecting evangelicals rather than moderates, which pushes their agenda to the right. Obviously not as extreme as trump but over time who knows? The GOP used to be a very different party 10-20 years ago too.
5. Idk. As a trans woman living in Queensland, Crisafulli might as well be Trump in terms of what he wants to do to people like me...
6. I remember the Joh, Hillbilly Dictator....
7. I dunno man, the last Lib Premier wanted to turn the state into a prison. Boot camps for teens, locking up motorcycle club members just for their membership, indefinite imprisonment for people serving time for sexual crimes. Sure, we need to hold people accountable but the consequences have to fit the crime.
8. What's hilarious about this is my father LOVED Joh like a king... I spent years listening to him prattle on about what a great leader he was, never once mentioned how corrupt and right wing he was. Years later I started reading up on Joh and learned the real truth. My father, turns out, is a racist right wing boomer.
9. But didn’t a lot of good things get done under Joh? That’s what my colleagues tell me anyway.
10. A lot of regional qld are religious. The more remote you go the worse it gets. Plus farmers love the lnp
11. I was talking about family first. Criminalising abortion is one of their policies. The LNP haven't made their stance clear, but it appears many of its ministers are anti abortion. Looks like they'll win anyway, so we will see what happens.
12. Shaftonomics…
13. Nah they live in NSW, so they aren't part of this election. But yes pay a lot in election funding.
14. Wouldn't you need ... *millions* of people in a room ... before you came across even 1 mining magnate, though? Testament to truly how pathetic the LNP's top concern is. Getting rid of the mining tax means QLD will be drowned in cuts. There's no other way. Its messed up
15. None of that is actually factual. It just highlights the inequity of the issues the LNP focus on.
16. You want elections like the US?
17. You clearly just haven't been paying attention. Yes, the costings were strategically released very late by the LNP but Crisafulli has been around for YEARS. There's been two fkn televised debates between him and Miles. Maybe take more of an interest the rest of the year and you won't be surprised.
18. Oh that's what you mean, probably a tactic or poor planning, because they had 4 years to prepare.
19. lol dude. Just because you are in a vacuum politically doesn't mean others are. I knew Crisafullis opinion on this topic since 2018 when he last voted to keep it criminalised.
20. He released his costings on Thursday which is coincidently after the advertising embargo started. His own promises aren't even on there.
21. Of course he is. Why else do people scream "Jesus Christ!" When they see him coming.
22. 6 here but same. It just got crazier past LNP
23. It's the problem of Australian news run by Murdoch. I'm a Queenslander living in the US and when I read one of his news websites, I always wonder why it's always celebrity news (since when are onlyfans models celebs?) american politics, rich people blowing millions on real estate and saying everyone has to return to the office. Oh almost forgot those man baiting sex columns lol
24. Is there a YouTube channel where I can watch Question Time? Otherwise the last time I watched it was when I was sick and couldn't go to school ~25 years ago.
25. Or news.com.au
26. Meh. Unless a significant war breaks out, nothing really matters. Trump's biggest (only?) lasting impact in his previous term was judicial appointments which have no real effect on anyone outside the USA.
27. Yes. Do you honestly think that David Crisafulli is a fascist? The answer that any reasonable person would say is no, of course not. So, in this case, the very strong accusation of fascism loses its meaning, because it's not actually true. And therefore, if a true fascist ever tries to take power, your average citizen will be so desensitized to the accusation of fascism, that they will likely ignore it.
28. I want you to elaborate on the tactics and laws in question
29. what a ridiculous thing to say lol, the LNP is trying to win an election mate, of course they will be trying to drum up support from the population. There are literally hundreds of examples of LNP politicians participating in the peaceful hand over of power.
30. Nah, it's just that your kind seems to scare yourselves with things you guys make up in your heads
31. Lol
32. My only saving grace is that if the LNP win they will lose the next election. Any dumb fucks who vote for them today will see such negative impacts on their own lives very quickly..... But it would be better if they just didn't fkn win.
33. They’ll never see this, it’s mindnumbing to observe but there’s no way they’ll blame the LNP for any issues. I don’t get how anyone in their right mind could ever vote LNP. But they’re going to win and screw over our state for at least the next 4 years. Total nightmare.
34. don't blame them, they grew up under the LNP education system
35. What about him makes you foam at the mouth so much you’re on here throwing a tantrum
36. Keeping people alive by not being a neocon war hawk that starts unnecessary wars?
37. HahhA yep! I’m getting abused left right and centre today being called all sorts of names. Makes me laugh though they are sore losers.
38. Next level aye
39. It’s coming 😂😂😂
40. Like most of reddit. I call the online asylum. Some of these people encourage each other with absolute brain rot victim mentality rhetoric. I’ve seen posts on reddit saying they will neck themselves if Trump wins. That’s how wild these people are.
41. Haha I’m used to it. All of my posts on this sub are downvoted 🤣🤣🤣
42. Thanks. Its still dumb and serves the libs and labour.
43. Homelessness and high cost of living is due to high immigration. Basic economics: Price and Demand. Left wing governments in Canada, America, and yes, Australia, has screwed its citizens by allow way, way, way too many immigrants in under the pretence that the govt is "nice". People who are reliant on government, who get money for nothing, spend without paying tax or contributing. This drives up prices and prices never comes down. Example: $1000 per household for electricity is a short-term boost, but in the long run, prices are up forever. If that same government took the same money and built a better road or reduced the cost of energy, it would be a long term, "forever"saving. Anyway, if you didn't understand the original post, I don't have enough space here to explain basic economics.
44. I made an observation of reality. Just hang in there sunshine, you will see.
45. Yeah I'd agree it wasn't exactly "dabbling". More like "all in or you're racist".
46. Not sure what you mean. Please expand.
47. I mean sure he might reduce the number of bombs landing in the middle east.. probably all the way the down to 1 giant fucking nuclear one
48. Yup. One thing Trump is good at even with his big mouth is he does follow through on those with regards on foreign policy. He managed to do it already with Syria, remember the era where the rallies in the street was about Syria instead of Palestine?
49. Oh I totally agree with you this mob are cooked! But until they tank an entire states police force through corruption they won’t have reached the infamous heights of shitfuckery that Pumpkin Scone Joh reached…
50. You’re happy for violent rapists & child abusers to have lenient sentences? The victim gets a life sentence, why shouldn’t they?
51. The state was a prison during Covid
52. Yeah, he appealed to folk in certain segments of the community. Pauline Hanson attracts people with similar world outlooks 🤷‍♂️
53. The Queensland police ran a protection racket for brothels and illegal casinos and loved cracking the skulls of greenie protestors and murdering aboriginal people in their custody. Corrupt Russ, the police minister, and Joe's best buddy stood in the casino above Bubbles Bath House with the owner, watching a pre-recorded interview of him denying that there were illegal casinos in Queensland. I know, because I was there in the casino that night. It was a great casino too. Free food. Free booze. And if you lost all your money, they'd pay your taxi fare home. When the Police commissioner was asked how he could afford to buy an 800k home for cash on his 80k salary, he said he won the money at the races. "You must be very lucky?" he was asked, and he replied with a smirk on his face, "Yes. Yes, I was.". Christian nationalists and corruption go together like Sunday School and priests raping children.
54. Nothing good happened for qld citizens. Look up the details for the Fitzgerald enquiry. Property developers literally handed money over to the National Party ministers in brown paper bags. The police minister was corrupt as hell. The police force was a private army of the government. Good cops left the force. Those who stayed mainly either were corrupt, turned a blind eye and said nothing to the corruption or were ‘innocent’ but outnumbered. Illegal stops and searches were common and this was before the days of heavy drugs. The National party became the tail that wagged the dog. It will be the same with any new LNP government. Crisafulli knows that. He’s being disingenuous about the abortion debate, also about Voluntary Assisted Dying. More juveniles will find themselves incarcerated. Money will change hands again. If LNP voters think that the developers have had it easy in recent years then we will be in for a shock. Once in power the LNP will change our voting system to ensure that the state will be governed by a government who gets into power with as little as 34% of the vote.
55. Like?
56. No. He gerrymandered the voting so was in a long time. Any government in a long time builds a few roads and bridges. It’s unavoidable. His main shtick was trump like pronouncements of all the good he had done. As the US shows, some take a con-mans words at face value.
57. He decommissioned a lot of regional rail, forcing car dependency for many people in the regions. Can't drive due to being elderly, disabled, or if you just want the personal choice to not have to drive? Too bad!
58. This is but one of thousands of articles showing what a shit show Queensland was under Joh. It was good for some folk, not for others. And generally running twenty years behind national standards for education, healthcare, etc. The people that benefited often ignored the stuff they didn’t like. As an extreme example of how this can happen: Twenty five years ago a friend of mine was an aged carer for a German woman who’d been a young girl during WWII. She would celebrate hitler’s birthday each year because she remembered those formative years as being the best years of her life 🤷‍♂️ “There was an unemployment level of 11 per cent and 9 per cent inflation [in Queensland], but the cabinet had no capacity to actually do anything to respond to that,” Ms Menzies said. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-01/sir-joh-bjelke-petersen-qld-30-year-cabinet-documents-released/9270744
59. Lots of infrastructure built?
60. That’s right under Joh, World Expo 88 happened and Brisbane got Southbank to enjoy..? That whole area was a shithole before 88. Yeah might have been corrupt but he got shit done
61. Even though LNP sit back watching them commit suicide
62. They like the N part of LNP, some like the christofascism too.
63. Aaah understood, just can’t go anywhere without seeing a sign that claims LNP are planning to criminalise abortion… Family first weren’t even on my ballot! What exactly is unclear about the party head stating there will be no change to abortion laws under LNP? Other than a law protecting baby’s born breathing? Family first sound extreme! Not going to lie I view it as a two party system and give almost no thought to the minor party’s
64. One man, one vote. One woman, one vote. As far as the LNP are concerned, Rupert Murdoch and Gina Rinehart are that man and woman, and they have those two votes- the only ones that matter.
65. It’s the magnates that pay the LNP bills.
66. Using inaccurate data highlights nothing.
67. How crazy - the US election process is bizarre, such a waste of time & money.
68. I’d love their rules of first past post for each electorate, would eliminate the greens almost entirely
69. 😂💀
70. @aboutthehouse on YouTube. Also, you can stream it live from the Parliament website when it's on. It's mostly theatrics though and is basically politicians' chance to punch a message out before they all go and have a taxpayer funded drink together.
71. The western world follows US trends. Mr 'drill baby drill' getting in would have massive implications for what gets done about climate change short and long term. This isn't even to talk about how he's all but admitted he'd let Ukraine get steamrolled by Russia. You're saying no real effect outside the USA but those judicial appointments have lead to abortion rights being under attack all over the place. Including in QLD. It might hurt Aussie egos to admit it but what the yanks are doing very much concerns us.
72. Here's the thing. Chrisafuli is, at best, a puppet. A useful idiot. He's a front man for evangelicals and wealthy donors who have the same goals as the people behind the MAGA movement because, surprise surprise, many of them are the same people driving the same movements in different countries. Whether Chrisafuli is or isn't this or that is kinda irrelevant when they've shown their hand. By being their spokesman, he's willingly taken their goals and ideology on and is pushing for it. At worst, he's one of them. And I doubt they would allow anyone but a true believer in their cause rise so high.
73. Given how happily conservatives work with and walk alongside fascists, I've come to the opinion that conservatism is just fascism in a nice suit and with a mask on.
74. I actually thought you were speaking generally, as it’s often used (I believe correctly) in association with Trumpism. I don’t think David is a full blown fascist, no. But I think there’s a risk more extreme elements in the coalition will advance a lite version of Trumpism.
75. They are drumming up support by lying to people and preying on their fears. That is called propaganda. It's disingenuous and it's dangerous. But you just keep on keeping on my man. Don't let facts or history dissuade you from believing what you want to believe.
76. Ummm everything? The fact he’s a convicted felon? The fact he’s a rapist and a pedophile? The fact he’s a racist bigot and a (pretend) bible basher? The fact he thinks being president is some kind of game and not a serious responsibility? Need I go on?
77. Brickulous, you really know how to grind my gears - do you know that!
78. You're right, he doesn't start wars, because he capitulates immediately to every dictator around.
79. Trump would happily see Russia take Ukraine and the CCP take Taiwan. Both events would lead to untold and extended suffering.
80. lol
81. I mean, if you preference them as last/2nd last, it literally doesnt
82. False - high immigration is actually a right wing tactic to keep wages low and demand for housing high. Unions, for example, tend to oppose mass immigration. It has nothing to do with "nice", except when talking about refugees, which would be a drop in the ocean compared to regular immigration numbers. Australia in particular didn't change any rules to do with immigration since Labor came into office in 2022, there was merely a backlog of VISAs to process. Labor has actually tightened immigration - although the coalition voted against these changes. And the worst "handouts" you may be referring to were done under Morrison - $40 Billion to already profiting companies, most of which likely went to overseas investors, with no clawback method. A handout isn't just "money gone", it's supposed to have results. Spending $100B on new energy supply that'll cost $1B to run yearly once complete would be worth it in the long run compared to spending $10B every year to run existing energy supply and slowly building up. Likewise, letting people keep their homes or their livelihoods during COVID has the side benefit of preventing a bunch of homelessness and civil unrest, maintaining general wellbeing of the country. However much Jobkeeper costed was probably worth it in this regard (excepting paying already profitable companies). I get that economics is important, but there's also the social side - the socio-economics of things. What use is a high GDP if half your country is homeless meth heads who are constantly trying to kill the other half, for example? There's a balance that needs to be met. I suggest you spend a little time considering that other side, as it sounds like you have decided to fall back on economics as a simple equation, when it's actually much more complicated than that.
83. A lot of the things you’re complaining about are not problems of “left wing governments” but rather neoliberal economics, of which the LNP is the biggest offender. Governments love to harp on about immigration because it suits their political narrative, but the reality is that many of their policies are designed to depress wages and erode workers rights in favour of corporate and multinational interests. They explicitly say this as well! I’m not going to make a comment on the morality of immigration (in many instances Australia desperately needs workers) but the numbers of immigrants arriving here have been consistently high during the LNP years. You have to ask yourself why - hint it has way more to do with business interests and making the 1% richer, rather than being “nice”.
84. Can you give an example of how the government could take the $1000 energy rebate and instead use it to reduce the cost of energy?
85. Such gravitas, oh so sage. Just as unique as the next snowflake
86. https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/americas-long-history-of-meddling-in-other-countries-elections
87. And his minister for gaming, racing and corruption
88. Don't misrepresent me. My position is that no one should be held in custody indefinitely. Longer sentences are more expensive and lead to higher recidivism, making society more dangerous and inevitably higher taxes. How could I possibly advocate for that.
89. I don’t think any sane human being is a supporter of rape and child abusers. To suggest that is actually pretty dumb and quite stupid. But the fear-mongering and selling of misinformation, especially about youth crime is ridiculous. But the LNP are perfectionists at lies and false claims. The problem is the fear-mongering is a rally cry for the people that chose out of fear not out logic. Labor has addressed the issues but wait, the LNP must be in power, because we are the righteous ones. Ffs
90. Just so you know in queensland the MANDATORY sentence for assaulting a paramedic,nurse,doctor ect is 14 years of which precisely no one has had that applied meaning you can legislate for stronger sentences all you like it doesn't work that way
91. *the south east of the state*
92. Ask Deb Frecklington. The developers still do it😜
93. Sounds like Ipswich a couple of years ago.
94. World Expo 88 and Southbank
95. Dunno. Ask my colleague. He’s the one with the info like I said. Can you read?
96. Don’t you worry about that
97. Joh had nothing to do with Southbank. Him and Sallyanne Atkinson were going to make it all commercial and build luxury apartments for their developer mates. Only a public campaign turned the project into parklands. And Joh never got to open Expo, because he was a crooked old bastard who had been removed for being corrupt. Thanks to 4Corners and Phil Dickie
98. nice to know you'd trade away democratic freedom and rights just to enjoy a parkland
99. Yeah that's why I was told. Not sure why I get downvoted for asking a question. The mentality of some on here is truly fucked up
100. The country would be better off if we ditched the two party system. Systemic economic mismanagement has led us to where we are now. We don't take nearly enough in mining tariffs and as a result we haven't invested enough in critical infrastructure. Resulting in high energy prices, congestion on all major roads, inadequate hospital space etc, etc... Our state and federal governments have been relying in population growth and in turn rising house prices to artificially grow GDP for decades. This country needs a change through a minority government formed through independent and minor parties.
101. Lying Nasty Party don't care about inaccurate data highlights.
102. yeah, who wants to be represented by a party that suits them most? democracy? pssht, who needs it amirite?
103. And you could also say any Labor leader is a frontman for corrupt union members and bikie gangs?
104. And there you go, you have once again, just diminished the accusation of fascist. Conservatives and fascists are ideologically opposed on many facets. For example, fascists often believe in Authoritarianism, Large autocratic government, and the "subordination of individual interests for the perceived good of the nation or race", which is the absolute opposite of what a classic conservative would believe, as they often see individual and private rights as supreme and believe that small government is much better than a large, controlling one.
105. Op seemed to be pointing to David specifically, which is why I pointed it out. Perhaps you may be right, there could be LNP members who fantasize about being in power for the rest of their lives. I bet there are extremists greens members who think the same. But we have very strong political institutions, filled with checks and balances that will make sure that does not happen.
106. So no original thoughts really, just reasons shovelled down your throat by US media. Americans voting for Trump are for the most part - voting against whatever shadow government is currently in control (as it’s been made pretty evident America is run by unelected officials). They want what republicans have always wanted - a smaller less intrusive government. Americans voting for Kamala are for the most part - voting against the *man* Donald Trump because of who they believe he is; who he’s been portrayed as by the mainstream media. Coming in this thread and feverishly replying to anyone that offends you because of your feelings towards the presidential candidates *in another country*, is fucking bonkers. Dude needs to touch grass.
107. What specifically has he capitulated to dictators?
108. You clown. Who was in charge of immigration in Australia since Covid? Who runs Canada? Who has opened American borders? Your argument is dead before it started.
109. So how is the LNP the biggest offender for high immigration? Did you see the actual net number of new immigrants in Australia since the ALP came in power? Last time I checked, it was around 2.5x what the Libs brought in. Some research is due. Go check on the ABS website. Australia is one of the richest countries in the world. Even the poorest of us are much better off than the majority of the world. Yes, we are all in the top 5% of the world's richest. How? By big business doing well. Go look at countries that don't have many big businesses that are doing well and ask yourself if you want to live there.
110. There was more than a billion dollars that went into that. Quite simply increasing solar subsidies would have done that. It could have gone towards one of the massive pumped storage dams, etc. The problem with the Left is that it thrives on short term sugar hits. Give us some money now and we will vote for you.
111. OK, so you are suggesting the US or Russia or some other country interefered with elections in the USA, Australia, Canada, the UK and France to install left-wing governments, which have lead to mass immigration and the decay of society. Sure, I can go with that. It would be silly to think there is no interference in elections from overseas adversaries. If you look at how social media is biased, it is a given.
112. 🤣 Russ Hinze, who diverted a highway to go past a bottle shop he owned… 🤦‍♂️
113. You suggested indefinite sentences for these people were a bad thing…yes it’s expensive, but some people don’t deserve to be amongst the community.
114. You cant remember what he told you ? Or did he just say he did good things, you ask no further questions and started repeating it like it's a real thing? Are you stupid ?
115. Actually would get used today if they had the balls
116. Of course he did you clown.. typical Labor re-write history… I was there you clown
117. Because they are all clowns, and think Labor did everything..
