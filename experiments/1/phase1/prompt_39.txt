Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. The footy players quarantined when they came in. Queenslanders could return if they did the quarantine/had any mental discipline to do it. And yeah just cause they're Australians doesn't mean they aren't dumb or selfish. Yes that was really sad about the daughter with her dying father and was a really shit situation but there would've been a lot more funerals if we just let covid run its course before the vaccine. Also if NSW wasn't scared of "a cold" why did one of NSW's lockdowns last 107 days
2. That was not me questioning that was someone else, I simply replied - please read carefully. Is it really a meaningful vote if you include people who voted “because they have the cutest name”? I think this is an interesting topic to have an open discussion about - you should not be so close minded.
3. Just pragmatic and less gas lighty
4. Yes, deaths at work should be prevented. Shame union officials care more about their own pockets than safety.

6. You can work a trade without being a union member. I can assure you that the union comes to site and strongly advise you who to vote for. Most rank and file members vote for who they are told to vote for. I was a PKIU, BLF and CFMEU member since I was 14. I’ve seen and done all the union have to offer.
7. Short sighted and selfish world view. Basic conservative mentality.
8. Because there was no nice contracting position. It was a full time position. C'mon dude. Are you reading what I say?
9. OK, so you believe yourself to be in a position to design a better study? Sorry, but I put odds at less than 50% for that. And of course we are talking about the same thing. Step one is to interfere with hormones.
10. As the FAQ notes, it would be unethical to have the patients being treated not being aware about their treatment. This makes it unethical to perform and therefore unreasonable to discount studies for not being a double blind design. However, the blindness in question is about the patient being blind the treatment. The CASS report notes the other forms of blindness: > The term blind or blinded is used in RCTs. There are different levels of blinding: firstly, **if researchers are doing the assessments, they should not know which group a patient has been allocated to**. Secondly, the patient can be blinded so that they do not know if they are on the new treatment or the original treatment, or even on a placebo (dummy pills). Finally, the treating doctor (or team) should ideally be blind to the group allocation, so their treatment of the patients does not differ. The image you provide appears to be a screenshot form the [NICE evidence review](https://segm.org/sites/default/files/20210323_Evidence%2Breview_Gender-affirming%2Bhormones_For%2Bupload_Final_download.pdf#page=98). If you look at the detailed analysis of the first report in that list you'll find the lack of blinding is expanded as "assessors not blinded to treatment". The studies are being considered lower quality study because the *assessors* were not blinded to the treatment condition. Without that blinding it remains possible for the researchers bias to compromise the results. It is not unethical to blind the researchers in that situtation. This is significantly different to the claim about them being dismissed for not being double blind.
11. Your first link is comparing the general population with transgender population. We already know there is a higher risk of mental health issues in transgender population. This study is meaningless as it doesn't assess pre and post treatment (of any kind) among transgender individuals. You can't draw conclusions based on that. Your second link may find that there is an increased risk in children, but it also found an overall decrease and need to obtain more data - which is reasonable. You can't take one part and ignore all the other findings. I'm not getting any information from "clearly" biased websites. I have hands on experience, and a scientific background that gives me a good grounding in assessing the evidence available and the risks vs benefits. There is no conspiracy here as you imply, practitioners are trying to help people and right now people's lives are being politicised leading to more hurt. But you do you, I don't care.
12. > However, the suicide risk in transgender people is higher than in the general population and seems to occur during every stage of transitioning.
13. Yep. I would've thought that improving the nudgee bottleneck would be worth it more. I know the land around there is shit and swampy, but surely they could just like, expand that fucker into 8 lanes for about 20km and let it narrow down.
14. Erm yes, that’s exactly how it works. Jailing people (especially children) doesn’t prevent crime. That’s facts, friend. Poverty causes youth crime. Child abuse causes youth crime. Male violence causes youth crime. Jailing the product of the issues does not solve the problem. Personally I’m sick of men murdering women daily, but peoples belongings are much more important because fuck dem kids, right?
15. I can't comment on those specific instances and that sounds pretty egregious, but this hasn't been my experience.. I have seen examples of workers doing the right things, In spite of clients and management saying otherwise, because it saves people's bacon in the end. I have also seen unions used as an excuse for failed project delivery, despite all evidence to the contrary.
16. Oh damn, when were you diagnosed?
17. As a "rank and file" member, they may suggest, but ultimately people vote for who they want regardless.
18. The Miles Govt had an 'advisory panel' where they would 'consult' with the CFMEU on construction projects ie the union ran the Govt & essentially told Labor what construction companies would get the lucrative contracts at ridiculously inflated prices.
19. "making heaps more" I just assumed you weren't dumb and were taking into account that contractors must pay their own super and tax. either the monetary value of the remuneration package is higher after rehiring as a contractor, in which case why the fuck did they not use the leverage before, or the value of the remuneration package is lower after rehiring as a contractor, in which case: that's my point. The public service pays more to contractors in recognition that they actually save money by not having additional obligations to that worker like super, time off, employee benefits etc.
20. Absolutely. Undergraduate in biomedical science, post graduate in clinical physiology and at the pointy end of an MD in addition to work experience in the area. Nearly 8 years of having study design drilled into me does give me a pretty solid grounding to at the very least, recognise glaring flaws in studies, lol. And no, not the same thing at all. Hormone treatments are often the full extent of gender affirming care for many people and they will never have surgery. If you didn't spend all your time cherry picking dubious studies to confirm your preconceived notions - you might actually learn something new about the people's lives you are politicising for no good reason.
21. Repeating yourself doesn't make it any more true, if they weren't including control groups as one of their metrics, why did they bring it up so frequently? > The studies are being considered lower quality study because the assessors were not blinded to the treatment condition. Without that blinding it remains possible for the researchers bias to compromise the results. It is not unethical to blind the researchers in that situtation. This is significantly different to the claim about them being dismissed for not being double blind. Not in all studies, they would need to lay out the reasoning as to how it led to the results being influenced, it doesn't automatically make a study lower quality. That's an extremely unscientific way to assess research. For something like what they're discussing, it would be a difficult argument to make that the researcher being aware of of the situation would lead to bias having any impact upon the results, especially given the very noticeable and measurable results in a lot of the areas that the studied covered.
22. They should leave our kids alone. I’m not arguing over semantics; if we argue - they win. Fuck them for pitting us against eachother.
23. Yes, occurs at similar rates *during* their treatment *at the clinic* in the study. This doesn't mean it doesn't change *after* transitioning, it doesn't mean it isn't reduced from *before* starting to transition, and it doesn't prove causation because the study did not even look at those differences, so cannot draw those conclusions. It only proves that trans individuals are at a higher risk compared to the general population (which we know), and *this risk does not significantly change throughout their treatment*. The conclusion was that it is important to provide appropriate support to handle this risk - not deprive people of treatment that is proven in other, more appropriately designed studies to increase quality of life and mental health outcomes. You represented it as not decreasing *after* transitioning. This study didn't even asses pre-treatment risk/occurrence, or post treatment risk/occurrence. You misrepresented it. You are entitled to your opinion. But do not use scientific literature to justify your views. You have proven yourself to not have the ability to analyse or truly understand the methodologies and findings of the study (This is not something that comes naturally simply by having access to journal articles), but you're digging your heels in anyway. I think there is a word for that...
24. I feel like you're not understanding what I'm saying just downvoting immediately so I'll try and give an example. Brian is a normal guy, lives in suburbia with his family and is quite unremarkable. Every couple of weeks, Brian gets his tools, car or belongings stolen. He sets up a camera and sees the local bogan, BraeDon is the one stealing his belongings. He reports BraeDon and the police give him a stern old talking to. The next week, he catches BraeDon again, stealing from his neighbour, Steve. The police give him a REAAAALLY stern talking to. Anyway, the next day BraeDon is caught again stealing from Sharon, down the road. This time, BraeDon's really in for it. No dessert and straight to bed stuff. He ends up getting the sternest of stern talkings to. Eventually this continues until BraeDon ends up in jail for accumulation of about 200 crimes. Suddenly, Brian's tools stop going missing. Steve's house stops being broken into. What do we think is the common denominator? Perhaps if BraeDon was in juvie/jail after incident 1, perhaps Steve and Sharon might not have had to be victims of crime at all. So was a crime prevented by locking him up? And if BraeDon wasn't around, there's no reason to think another criminal would have magically sprouted out of the ground to commit those same crimes in his absence. Yes, there are usually multiple criminals in an area, but it's unlikely that another would go to the same areas and commit those crimes on top of their own crimes just because BraeDon left a void of his potential crimes. The net result is the number of crimes would go down due to lack of freedom/opportunity. Would you apply the same logic of "well if they are in jail we'll still have the same crime anyway so what's the point" to serial killers or rapists? There are others out there so we should just leave Ted Bundy to it - he did have a REALLY SAD childhood after all. Plenty of kids grew up in poverty and suffered abuse and didn't turn out to be dregs of society.
25. There's def problems in all areas. I'm just saying if unions focused solely on the workers, it would avoid/reduce the delays you've seen, as well as what I have.
26. I have been on a site where everyone was told they are a useless cunt and an empty vessel if they don’t vote the way they are told, it’s not really suggestion. Never been involved in the union have you?
27. No I think we can take it as read that most people vote for who they are told. That’s why there’s always people out there front with the little bits of paper so you don’t forget between the car and the ballot box. Most Australians don’t want to vote and don’t want to know about politics, so they vote for the simplest reason they can find or be told.
28. I'm a contractor dude. Different industry but I know my shit. It is worth way more and when I demand it is worth even more. Emergency/breakdown work is even more again. It's for numbers on columns dude. It will cost us more. It has every time. Trust me. The only winner is the contractor.
29. That's just not true. Failing to avoid bias whenever possible is unscientific. Here's what [a general article on the topic](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8308085/) has to say: > We blind because the potential for bias is everywhere. Bias can take numerous shapes and forms when people involved in a research study are privy to information about the assigned interventions. ... Differential treatment, attention, or attitudes toward subjects by a non-blinded healthcare team or other members of the research staff also pose a major threat to unbiased outcomes. Importantly, once bias is introduced from any one of these potential sources, there exist no analytical techniques by which to reliably correct for this limitation. ... > Blinding of data collectors and outcome adjudicators (sometimes the same individuals) is crucial to ensure unbiased ascertainment of outcomes. ... Although subjective outcomes are most at risk of ascertainment bias, seemingly objective outcomes often require some degree of subjectivity and therefore are at risk of bias as well. ... > This rationale strongly suggests that the blinding of as many individuals as is practically possible limits bias in clinical trials.
30. Who is they? Edit: it's not semantics. You posted studies that didn't reflect your claims and Chery picked data. Not semantics but whatever.
31. Cute fanfiction you’ve written there - but it all relies on the (incorrect) assumption that youth crime exists in a vacuum, and that bad kids are a finite minority rather than created by poverty, abuse and violence. Evidence (FACTS mate, FACTS not emotional stories) shows us that jailing kids doesn’t prevent crime. Brian’s tools are still getting stolen. Brian should learn to lock up his shit, or vote for parties who want to prevent crime rather than charge me (the taxpayer) to jail children. Call me when we’re actually jailing adult men for their adult crimes. Until then, lay off the fucking children.
32. I'm a financial member of cfmeu currently. I admit I've only been a member for just over 4 years now, but can honestly say I've not had that level of "suggestion" put to me. Mostly it's some delo/organiser having a dribble about some shit, most seem uninterested unless it's a site closure. That was working at Queens Wharf with 2000+ workers onsite at peak.
33. Deep state elite, the powers that be, ‘they’. Saw a good thread on it, they said they’re: (Paraphrasing) The corporate blob + military industrial complex + big banks = deep state elite The corporate blob being Blackrock, vanguard and state street. Blackrock owns over 80% of corporations in America alone, then there’s also the other two. All of blackrocks board members and subsidiaries own and are major shareholders of all of state street, and vanguard. Vice versa for vanguard owning blackrocks, SS’s, etc. They act as a homogenous blob. Owning all of media, medicine, military, agriculture etc. Given their ties and positions on boards like the WEF, UN, etc. their reach is global. On digital (video) record saying they want to lower population, most think through means of war etc. but it’s far more likely they’re trying to achieve their “agenda 2030” plans through destroying the nuclear family essentially. Divorces are up, marriages are down, relationships are down, hookup culture is up, birth rate subsequently dropping, to the point that which in a mere 2-3 generations we could (100-300 years) they could have achieved their population goal of 100m-500m. Regardless what we think of Elon musk, he is an enemy to the deep state elite. Corporate blob pulled their advertising from x for example and are launching an attack in the media on him. He advocates that we have a population crisis and need to have more kids, contrary to the DSE. This is not a conspiracy, this is a fact. That being said, Elon- despite his original predisposition against trump for example, has had to cozy up to him due to the regulation chokehold being put on him by the DSE, quite nearly destroying Tesla, space X for example. If he wants his company’s to survive, he needs to win over the establishment - sadly they aren’t even inviting him to the electric vehicle summits- tesla, they didn’t invite Tesla to the government summit for it. Insane and overt display of sides. Additionally, there are others who fit into this narrative, however some are being used as pawns. Essentially further creating this “red team vs blue team” debate among society; across the western world. In truth, musk isn’t good nor bad, trump isn’t good nor bad, neither is Kamala, or trans people, or cis people. People are people, and we vary on the spectrum of things. A lot of people, myself included hated trump for example. But when I asked myself for reasons, I couldn’t think of anything except article headlines. I couldn’t even name the specifics of this such strong feeling. I guarantee you, if you ask others, about trump, trans people, Jordan Peterson, anyone that is being used as figure heads of the red team blue team show- next to no one will be able to mention exact examples for their hate. It’s completely artificial; and I was shocked when I realised this. We are worthy of love and acceptance; however they have shrouded this undeniable goal with classist warfare, rich v poor, black vs white, racial warfare, battle of the sex’s - I.e women and men currently hate eachother the most now, than we have in entirety of history. With the rise of radicalised third and fourth wave feminism, had sown the roots of radical toxic masculinity, and men’s rights movements. This can be seen in things like the rise of Andrew Tate and dude bro culture. All in all it’s a multi pronged attack through the guise of collectivism via the Trojan horse of neoliberalism. What we were discussing may have been your area of expertise, but this is mine. It’s horrible, and spreading awareness on the fact that they are creating and perpetuating discord in the hopes of destroying the nuclear family, the self / individualism - is terrifyingly accurate and happening right as we speak. Another proponent for this move was to get the western world to not just accept, but WANT far right authoritarianism and the surveillance state. They ushered in radical third and fourth wave feminism inside the Trojan horse of neoliberalism, and have succeeded in pushing the left to the right, the right to the far right, and in essence - have frustrated the 90% of the population that don’t support these radicalised ideologies, to BEG for the surveillance state, to BEG for more control - even if it comes at the cost of less liberty. Churchill spoke of this, I believe it was Truman or Roosevelt who mentioned this exact method of how to transform the governing political ideology to such of more government control and right wing associations. The past few decades have been a drip feed of this, and we are seeing it come to its fruition now. We see this in Europe, in France, in Argentina; where far right wing parties are dominating the polls. We now see it making a resurgence in America, and with Dutton - the LNP here in Aus too. In order to stop this, we must work together. We must remember what we have lost, love for one another. Regardless of your creed, sexual orientation, sex, race, social status- I LOVE YOU. And I hope we can make it out stronger, and more importantly; together. ❤️
34. Ooft. Blaming the victim for the crime is a bold move. Real "well she shouldn't have dressed so provocatively" vibes. It's not really a fanfic anyway - it was just a loose recollection of what happened in my suburb a month ago. The difference is that Steve actually went and shot BraeDon in the shoulder with a nail gun to get his belongings back, but I'm not sure vigilante justice is the answer for now so I omitted that bit. I'm not saying we shouldn't be locking up adults for adult crimes or that we should target youth crime. We should be doing both.
35. Mate I’ve been in it for 35 years, high rise construction and can tell you that I’ve been in town with 100 members while an organiser called Anna Bligh a cunt and a slut over a megaphone and told no one to vote for her, that was when they had it in for her. Every election we’ve had organisers tell us in no uncertain terms who to vote for.
36. You need to check your algorithm my dude. None of this is because of any deep state. The concerns might be real, but what you are being lead to believe is to blame is rabbit hole shite. If you watch the 2030 thing in context it doesn't say nor imply any of this. I too am in pretty deep in this lore, but on the other side because I've lost people to these kind of beliefs, or more so the cause of these issues.
37. Trump is a rapist. That's a good reason to hate someone.
38. I live in one of those youth crime hotspots. Every single day people are whining on the community page about having their things stolen and every single day they admit they left their shit unlocked. Weirdly, my shit (tools plus multiple luxury cars) doesn’t get stolen? I’m glad you lot decided sacrificing women’s lives is worth it because some guy said jailing kids will end theft. We’ll just have to ignore all the evidence telling us jailing kids doesn’t work because you people get your cocks hard for punishing those you deem lesser than yourselves. Again, call me when adult men are doing adult time for their adult crimes.
39. My apologies for any confusion, in truth I actually have completely forgot what agenda 2030 was about! I was using it moreso as an example of world agenda that the WEF for example leans towards. There are videos I’ve seen where certain high profile members are speaking about the population ‘issue’ (entirely bs tbh. We don’t have an overpopulation issue. Anyone with half an ounce of critical thinking knows that). And speaking on how lowering the birth rate could see the decline to their number in X amount of generations. No conspiracy there, in 4(1080p)k. Regardless the case, the message I am sharing is unity, and anti-division. I am spreading that the media is a massive propaganda firm and people are subscribing to it; so much so, to the extent that which they personally identify with red team or blue team. When I see these buzzwords like transphobic, maga trumper, lefty, (in derogatory term) feminist, etc. - it brings to light that these are modern terms coined by the industry that which delivers us news on top, 24/7 in the palm of our hands. Social media feeds have indoctrinated us to their church of lies, and we can’t get enough of it. All I wish to say to you is that I love you, and I hope the next time you hear or think of saying any of the above, or choosing a ‘side’; to spread the word and/or remember that there is an entire corporate apparatus that has split us in the first place- any hatred we have for eachother, however artificial; should be reserved for them. ❤️
40. I hope you can apply this thought process to our trans brothers and sisters and not allow the likes of Elon, and others politicise their existence for their personal gain. Best wishes 🙏
41. 100%! This goes to everyone! I have no room in my heart for hate, especially artificially constructed hate. Best wishes to you too my friend ❤️
42. I lived near a train station in an inner suburb of Brisbane 20 years ago and was broken into three times. Crime was much worse then, but Murdoch wasn’t as dangerous and didn’t influence elections so much then. I suggest that what you may feel is a balanced approach is in fact heavily influenced.
43. Why bother now? It's done. Should have asked this question a week ago. Youth crime and recidivism were down according to the recent QPS report, labour had already introduced some harsh policies many weren't fond of. The bed has been shit and we all have to lay in it now.
44. The election is over and the party with regressive and / or non existent policies won. You voted for that, as is your democratic right. You don't need to justify it, and people here don't need to make you feel better about your decision.
45. Going into this election, Labour's policies were very much "Yes, i understand this will cost us $10 now, but it will save us $100 later" LNPs policies were "We're not those guys". It sucks to hear that your local area has been broken into, but the ire that that Labour supporters have had with that approach is that it's kind of like; "Hey, i've personally experienced a hardship, the whole state needs to readjust" I think Miles was done dirty, only having 10 months to show the state what leadership under him looks like (and it was a good 10 months imo), but we'll now have 4 years to see what an LNP government will do for us. Fingers crossed i keep my job.
