Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. >I absolutely care about healthy babies- I want every baby to be born to parents who want to have a child and are ready to properly care for them. Yes, that sounds ideal. However, the fact that you think that it is an option to kill a healthy baby puts the lie to that statement. >You are the one who doesn't actually give a shit about the well-being of these hypothetical 'healthy babies'; once they're born you couldn't care less about what happens to them. I don't want people to be killed in any stage of their life, only insane and sadistic people champion that; so, pro-abortion, pro-war, serial killers, these kinds of people. >You want their mothers to be forced to carry them to term & birth them, regardless of risk to their mental and physical health. Lie. We are talking about healthy pregnancies conceived consensually. Rape and medical issue pregnancies are different. >Even a healthy baby is at risk of abuse if the mother is suffering from PPD/PPP, and unwanted babies are much more likely to be victims of abuse and infanticide. Abortion of a healthy baby is infanticide, you're drowning in cognitive dissonance. >Get the fuck off your 'i care about babies' high horse. Until you are prepared to condemn the killing of healthy consensually conceived babies, you are a creature without morals, with no right to speak on anything, to anyone. There is nothing lower than infanticidal people, they are on the same level as paedophiles and soldiers. >Women do not have an obligation to incubate whatever stray embryo lodges in their uterus, and it's really as simple as that. Again with the medical language to hide the truth of what is occurring. Pregnancy is not the incubation of a stray embryo lodged in the uterus. Look at those terms. * incubate * stray * lodged * embryo * uterus You're doing everything you can to hide the humanity of the baby, while still using "women". If you're going to refer to pregnancy with a list of words like that, then surely you should be referring to women as: * biped * homosapien * organism * female Or whatever other dehumanising language you can think of. Be consistent. If you want to say incubate and stray lodged embro, then say female biped. If you want to say woman, then say baby and pregnancy. You can't have it both ways. Do people have an obligation to their own children? Well, I guess that depends if they want to survive. It's like asking if people have an obligation to eat, sleep, stay warm... only if they want to be alive, I suppose.
2. Sure but it would be a pointless bill then because who is it aimed at? Failed abortions don’t exist. Babies before 22 weeks are not viable.
3. You still have to get an ultrasound for a D&C. That’s got nothing to do with the decriminalisation. The doctors have to confirm what they’re doing. You still have to get a medical abortion drug through your doctor now. You can’t just have people ordering random drugs for themselves.
4. Heart surgery is also legal everywhere. Doesn’t mean there is anyone able to do it in every rural town. Access to all sorts of medical care is an issue everywhere rural. I would say the most D&Cs are done in Brisbane because that’s where the women’s hospital is. It’s unfortunate people have to travel but that’s just Australia.
5. Do you even know what: “Those laws will not change” means? What does that sentence mean to you? If I have 2 brain cells, God forbid the 1/8th of one you have.
6. All those things are buying products based on what it could be in the future……. But then again the fact that you think some investments aren’t a gamble, kind of shows the state your head is at. Heck even putting it in a bank is a gamble. There’s no assurance that you will definitely get said money back you’ve put in.
7. Just not sure how you knew my pet name for your mum is the cookie
8. Why is a foetus not a human being though? When does a foetus become a human being to you? As soon as it is outside the womb? To me, a foetus is just a human being that is growing inside the mother, waiting to be born.
9. [deleted]
10. and? born alive does NOT mean born viable. and again, 1% of abortions are performed after 22 weeks. sadly, there are some abnormalities that are just not detectable until that late. the 'procedure' in those tragic cases is to induce birth and then provide comfort until the fetus passes. These are not viable babies being aborted, and to present it as such is an outright lie.
11. That proves absolutely nothing about what is being discussed lol. They are born alive, but are NOT viable for life, meaning they either will die regardless or be in a hospital the rest of their life. That is the only circumstance in which an abortion can be had after 22 weeks anyway, and current practices are that babies that may be viable for life are worth saving. This means the bill is useless. Doctors already give care to failed abortions that may have a chance of living. Now they want them to give care for babies that will die anyway without a chance of living.
12. What about them? An abortion is an abortion.
13. in the very very rare cases where a healthy baby will be aborted after the 20week mark it will be because of reasons such as being unable to access abortion care, DFV, substance abuse issues ect NOT CHANGE OF MIND. in these cases the baby will still not be viable outside the womb, the baby will still die once induced and attempting cpr is still insane. i would rather women who are unable to carry and care for babies to not be forced to have them. i do not want to see a rise in DV or infant neglect. it’s insanely cruel you would rather children suffer once they are born and able to feel pain and suffering, to families who can’t care for them. Regardless this is such a small percentage of abortions and is a strawman argument, passing this bill will make it significantly harder for women who medically need second trimester abortions to get them, and will significantly reduce the places you can get them. bills like this also place unnecessary scrutiny on women who have had miscarriages, just look at the USA.
14. Well, "if" a mother realises she has an ectopic pregnancy, they might decide to have it removed (an abortion) so they live. That mother doesn't necessarily want to kill that unborn child, that unborn child may have been very wanted, but the mother might decide they want to live for the other children they have. "If" a mother decides that they are not fit to be a mother, for many reasons, and the pregnancy wasn't planned, they may decide it is better to end the pregnancy. "If" a 13 year old girl is raped by her father, she mat decide she wants an abortion so she has no connection to the man her broke her. Aside from bringing vasectomies back to the table, we can also discuss just how difficult it is to adopt within Australia, and how expensive it is to adopt from outside of Australia. Maybe "if" that was easier, people would choose that option first.
15. They are not babies, they are cells! And we are not incubators. You obviously know nothing about pregnancies or fetus development, so stop starting arguments, and go educate yourself.
16. Look, take babies out of it for a moment. It's a very emotive subject because babies are cute and tiny and helpless. Imagine I need a kidney. Well, not just any kidney, I need YOUR kidney. And also half of your liver. Without it, I'll die. You'll probably survive the organ donation, although to be honest, there are going to be a lot of side effects for you. Some of them will be temporary, but some of them will be permanent. And while we're both recovering, it will be your job to take care of me. You'll actually get in a lot of trouble if I die, but don't worry - no one cares if you get hurt from caring for me. And what I'm describing here is the best possible outcome scenario. I know that might not sound very fair, but the bad news is, the government has decided that because you took the risk of having a functioning kidney and liver - you are mandated by law to donate them to me now. But that's not what happens, is it? Because you can not force another person to use their body to keep someone else alive in any other situation than a pregnant woman. It would be unconscionable to make laws that said you can.
17. What about medical abortions? What about abortions where the mother would die without one? What about abortions where mother and foetus would die without one? Baby body survival - unfortunately the unborn baby is likely to have more rights than a living person if we go the way of America. Again, let's bring vasectomies to the table.
18. Pro-choice is about bodily autonomy and acknowledging that no one has the right to dictate what an adult can or cannot do in regard to their body.

20. I don’t know if you read my comment but I said with the cost of living people can’t afford that and they are resorting to things such as buying medication online.
21. Heart surgery is a really stupid comparison to an abortion, which is a relatively straightforward procedure that could be easily performed in almost any regional clinic or hospital. that is just such a ridiculous comparison to make, I don't think we're chatting in good faith anymore so I'm out. Thanks for the chat!
22. Funny how LNP voters act like the scum they vote for, impressive how well you manage to dodge questions just like the fooli. once again, why didn't he answer the question about a conscious vote. why can't you even talk about it? pretty funny, it's like being allergic or something.
23. I like how I explain why they aren't and you just... Ignore it and re-iterate. Passive investing is the practice of investing ETFs. ETFs are investments in many companies to form a fund that the public can invest in. ETFs are not a gamble, unless a large number of the largest companies in the world collapse. If that happens, we have bigger problems than an investment portfolio. All you're telling me is that you aren't knowledgeable enough about investing to be talking about it. If you're not an idiot, your money is in a bank that is covered under the $250k government guarantee. If a bank fails, you will get your money back, provided you are not, as aforementioned, an idiot. Have more than 250k? Use another bank. Quite honestly though, the government won't allow a bank to collapse. I imagine it would cost them a lot less money to save a bank than it would to reimburse potential millions of Australians. Why are you even talking about investments? I feel like you think it was some form of addition to your initial statement, but it just kind of resulted in you being shown up, so I'm not sure what your goal was?
24. Enjoy that old hag ig I hope you like maggots cos ur cookie is 6ft under
25. Well it’s not a fucking horse now is it? Of course it is human if it is inside another human. It just doesn’t have human rights therefore it’s not murder to terminate.
26. Do you think anyone will ever care about your books?
27. [deleted]
28. Born alive doesn’t mean born not viable, and to present it other wise is an outright lie
29. [deleted]
30. You keep talking about 20 weeks. I'm asking about all pregnancies. It's horrific to kill a healthy baby, don't you think?
31. '"If" a mother decides that they are not fit to be a mother, for many reasons, and the pregnancy wasn't planned, they may decide it is better to end the pregnancy.' This is the only relevant paragraph. If someone feels unfit to look after their own children, that is a serious problem. If they then think the solution is to kill their own children, it is an even more serious problem. Defending the autonomy and liberty of infanticidal parents is beyond bizarre. We don't do it with paedophiles. No-one is out here claiming they have "bodily autonomy" to hurt children. So why do it for the parents, those who should be the most protective of their children? Infanticidal people have no place in a sane world.
32. The cells are a baby and the incubators are mothers. Funny how you want to dehumanize the baby by callling it mere cells but want to humanize the mother by not calling her an incubator. Cells in an incubator or a baby in a mother. It's one or the other, be consistent.
33. Good grief. Pregnancy does not cost women one of their kidneys and half their liver. I've heard a lot of terrible and desperate pro-abortion arguments, but that is actually the most absurd. Congratulations.
34. The discussion is healthy babies conceived consensually. If you are fine with killing such babies, you don't need any excuses like medical issues or rape pregnancies.
35. No, pro-choice is about killing babies and cloaking that horror behind notions of personal freedom and liberty.
36. My point is that those statistics do not separate out babies born alive that have conditions that are not compatible with life - you asked whether I would support a bill that made a provision for that and I would, but there is no evidence that babies who would otherwise survive are being born breathing and left to die. Even in the document you linked it says: There are almost always severe circumstances leading to a small number of women who choose to terminate a pregnancy after 20 weeks gestation. Which implies there are few, if any, healthy pregnancies being terminated after 20 weeks. There is zero evidence that this is happening. I would also say that if you look up the current clinical guidelines for babies showing signs of life following a termination, they are reasonable and sensible. They include discussion with the parents beforehand what they would like to happen, ie should they perform intervention or not. Introducing a bill as suggested would mean doctors have no choice. Also it means that doctors may simply refuse to perform the termination for fear of what might happen, leaving the woman to carry an unviable pregnancy to term which would cause serious mental harm.
37. You realise its a crime to buy any restricted medication online without a prescription... right.... And even if you have a prescription, you need to inform border force of your import. As for :people can't afford it, well people sometimes steal things because they cannot afford them, the laws still apply. If they dont pay for the costs of their elective treatment, someone else has to... I will also add that you had a single example from 2010, 14 years ago... doesnt seem like its a common conviction.
38. I’m not an LNP voter… in fact I didn’t vote at all. 🤣🤣🤣. I’m just a bystander in this state watching the meltdown on these subs today by people who got absolutely sucked in by the scare tactics created by each other. Which culminated into today’s Chernobyl. It was even funnier them trying to defend themselves. It will be just as when Boomers keep thinking Dutton is doing a great job, he wins election and Aus goes through 3 PMs in the space of 12-18 months again.
39. Yikes. “Unless a large number of the world’s largest companies collapse”: so you admit there is risk of that, no matter how small. You reckon if the Chinese invaded and our banking system collapsed, they’d be like oh yeah, nah, we will pay it all back to you. Again, minute risk, still there. You brought up you don’t buy product on what it could be in the future. You open up that term deposit, it says in 12 months you’ll get 4% more… there is still a risk you lose it all. And you know I have a point here. I’m literally talking about the safest thing you can possibly do to. Everything we buy, we buy in the premise of what it could be in the future or out of pure necessity.
40. Did her job that she didn’t lose not require her to be alive?Is she a Labor minister?
41. So a foetus doesn't deserve human rights even though it is human?
42. [deleted]
43. if you think that is what they will stop at doing, you need your head read.
44. This entire thread says yes 🙌🏼
45. This is just galactic levels of bullshit. The only way to get a late term abortion is if the fetus has abnormalities not compatible with life. You think these ladies are waking up one morning, 30 weeks pregnant and deciding, actually no, I don't want this, and getting abortions? Cause it does not work like that.
46. Technically, no. But the law is never good at legislating these things because medicine is complex. Do you provide life-prolonging care to a baby that will only ever survive on life support? Is that really morally okay, to prolong a life full of pain and suffering? Technically, the law would require you to because it is 'life saving' treatment. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. Do you put a neonate on dialysis even though it won't survive long even with the treatment? Isn't it better to provide supportive care, comfort, relief and a safe place for the parents to spend a short time with their baby? Leave this to the well-establish medical practice guidelines that already account for this. No need to legislate medical procedures that are already medically and ethically sound, and if there is a question about the ethics, the decision is referred to the courts anyway so no need to legislate it with meaningless shite.
47. almost like i’m talking directly about a bill you responded to about 20+wk abortions🤯. I don’t think abortions, especially before 10weeks are killing babies at all. do you think fertilised eggs at fertility clinics are babies? do you think fertilised chicken eggs are chickens? I’m not against abortions because i know the research and the research says outlawing abortions doesn’t stop abortions it stops safe abortions and criminalises miscarriages, and non-viable births. i’m not against abortions because it is a woman’s right to choose when, where, and who with she wants to have a baby with. i’m not against abortions because i know forcing women to raise children(sometimes children born from rape)they don’t want is a nightmare reality and not one i want to live in. i’ve made my stance very clear, on early and late stage abortions for both medical and personal reasons, im not sure what else you want me to say quite honestly.
48. See this right here shows the misogyny inherent to all pro-forced-birth arguments- you are equating a tiny, non-sentient blob of cells to a living breathing adult human woman. And referring to pregnant women as 'incubators' unironically is pretty fucking disgusting!
49. No it doesn't, generally. But it forces them to grow a placenta and use that, as well as the rest of their body to keep someone else alive. Although kidney and liver failure are both known complications of pregnancy. So I used what is known as a metaphor to draw a comparison to the fact that there is no other situation where a person can be mandated by law to donate their body to someone else to keep it alive. Because God knows you don't understand empathy.
50. The point and you have been totally missed just recognise that maybe women should be able to do as they need to do whether that means they abort or not ffs and conservatives should stay the fuck out of women’s uteruses!
51. > Yikes. Ignoring what I said again. > "Unless a large number of the world's largest companies collapse": so you admit there is risk of that, no matter how small. There is a point where the risk is so unbelievably, incredibly small, that it's not even worth considering. Where we get to the point where if it did happen, we'd have much bigger problems. That's one of them. > You reckon if the Chinese invaded Here we go. > and our banking system collapsed, they'd be like oh yeah, nah, we will pay it all back to you. I mean, first off, that's not the Australian government anymore. If you're invaded by a foreign power, shockingly, they aren't going to resume business as usual. I don't know why you think this is a valid point. > Again, minute risk, still there. Minute risk of you getting shot the moment you step outside every day, too. Do you still go outside? Mhm. > You brought up you don't buy product on what it could be in the future. Yup. > You open up that term deposit, it says in 12 months you'll get 4% more... Shitty rate, but yup. > There is still a risk you lose it all. If the bank collapsed. See previous comment. > And you know I have a point here. You... Tell yourself that... > I'm literally talking about the safest thing you can possibly do to. What? > Everything we buy, we buy in the premise of what it could be in the future No. > or out of pure necessity. Sometimes, obviously. I... Don't understand what your point is. It's muddled words trying to make a point. It doesn't make sense, it's not logical.
52. She’s not dead. Just to me. I’m gonna go abort my 12 month pregnancy now
53. It’s a foetus. By law it doesn’t have rights.
54. Lmao you're pathetic.Go to school buddy, learn a thing or two.
55. Wrong https://assets.nationbuilder.com/wfa/pages/498/attachments/original/1670561421/Q_A_Fact_Sheet_Late-Term_Abortion_.pdf?1670561421
56. >I don’t think abortions, especially before 10weeks are killing babies at all. "Killing babies is fine because it isn't killing babies." >I’m not against abortions because i know the research and the research says outlawing abortions doesn’t stop abortions it stops safe abortions "Bad things should be legal because people will do them anyway. Research shows people rape and murder regardless, so let's make it legal and safe to do so." >i’m not against abortions because it is a woman’s right to choose when, where, and who with she wants to have a baby with. "I'm not against women killing their babies because they can choose to get pregnant". >i’m not against abortions because i know forcing women to raise children(sometimes children born from rape)they don’t want is a nightmare reality "Killing babies is fine for people who want to kill their babies. Also sometimes pregnancy is the result of rape but I don't care about that because I think consensual pregnancies can also be killed."
57. >misogyny No. There is nothing hateful about not wanting babies to be killed. There is everything hateful about wanting babies to be killed. It's not about the sex of the babies either, both male and female babies are precious. >pro-forced-birth No, we're talking about consensually conceived healthy babies, not rape pregnancies. >you are equating a tiny, non-sentient blob of cells to a living breathing adult human woman. No, you are equating a baby with a tiny, non-sentient blob of cells, like a mole to be removed. I am being honest. Women are not incubators and babies are not clumps of cells. Stop hiding behind dehumanising medical language.
58. I do understand empathy, that is why I am viscerally horrified by the deaths of healthy babies conceived consensually. It's also why I despise the arguments that try to justify such a nightmarish act. Your metaphor was simply a lie. We are talking about healthy pregnancies, not ones where either the baby or the mother are at risk. No good sane person thinks it is possible to kill such babies.
59. This goes for all medical treatments then?
60. Someone doesn’t like being proven wrong…. Hahahahahahhaha. Good luck out there Big Fella. Let’s hope those risks of yours don’t end up biting you in the ass, wouldn’t want to be buying something in the premise that it only may come into fruition now would we.

62. Oh another made up lie , do you want to have a rally for dead mothers now? See you’re in a battle of wits completely unarmed. I am pro abortion and in your case I think it should be compulsory
