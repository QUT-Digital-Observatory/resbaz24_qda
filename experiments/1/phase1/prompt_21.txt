Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Quite possibly, would be nice if the Quirk review actually released the mapping and more details of what they reviewed, rather than leaving the Archipelago designs as the only image that all news pieces use when referring to the Vic Park plan, when we have no idea where the stadium was meant to be sited
2. Thank you. I needed the laugh.
3. QSAC is only 3 km from the train line. It is surely possible to build something like Olympic Park line in Sydney?
4. Lane closures on vulture St, mains Rd, Wellington rd and Stanley St, for upgrades? Hasn't crr and metro been enough of a disruption?
5. I'd argue that suncorp is not compatible with pedestrian traffic from trains, most people commute to and from there by bus or rides hare.
6. For comm games on the gc, almost everything was delayed, because a lot of it was hosted in high traffic areas.
7. Hi. Building over the ICB was not put forward by Quirk in his stadium report. It was not included in the $3.4 billion. It’s an idea pushed by Archipelago Architects and others in the property sector. If you look at the park and then at Archipelago Architect pictures you will see that the placing of the stadium etc don’t even take into account the topography nor the fact that there is heritage listing in many of the area he proposed to throw a build over.
8. No net loss? Is not the same as no loss.
9. There's a million more important things to focus on than a freaking sports stadium.
10. I mean we should give this guy a shot to see how he behaves. The next election is 4 years away. Plenty of time to call him out between now and then. Love or hate him, he’s here to stay, we’re under one team now, team Queensland.
11. That’s the best cricket pitch in the country you wanna tear down and replace with a lame drop in pitch.
12. This is actually exactly what happened when Arsenal football club moved form Highbury stadium to Emirates in the early 2000s in London. But the team got a far superior stadium…
13. Why would they not just get revenue from selling land elsewhere to developers and put a world class stadium right next to the brand new CRR train station rather than gut that area of the one major economic asset that it has? Could you imagine how irrelevant woolloongabba would be without the Gabba?
14. It's already a PDA?
15. Surely social housing next to a primary school is a bad idea?
16. I've had these same questions. As a spectator, apart from the bloody sun shining right in your eyes in the late afternoon at the eastern end, there's nothing wrong with the Gabba. And I'm pretty sure everyone parroting the line that it's not fit for purpose has no clue what the real issues are because nobody ever fucking says why. So I read the government's review, and, well, now I know. From the perspective of the Gabba staff and the athletes, it's shithouse. I'm just going to plagiarise bits of the report here: \* The roof structure (especially the tensioned fabric construction) is coming to the end of its design life, noting that some of the roof failed in 2008 and required replacement and strengthening. \* There is localised degradation in sections of the steel structure which will need to be further assessed and addressed. \* Steel structure corrosion protection is at the end of its protective life with areas of surface corrosion needing repair as part of regular maintenance. \* Cooling and ventilation plant and equipment is at the end of its life and requires replacement. \* Lighting and services infrastructure needs upgrading to meet changes in sporting requirements. \* Lifts and vertical transport suffer from performance and reliability issues. \* Fire life safety systems will require upgrading to meet changes in standards following further assessment. Then there's functionality: \* An ambulance is unable to enter the field of play because the structure is too low for the height of ambulances. Due to the narrowness of back-of-house corridors, even the much smaller Medicab cannot take players all the way to medical rooms. Instead, injured players must be carried by stretcher because of the narrowness of spaces. \* AFL player facilities for the home team, including warm up spaces, fall well short of being acceptable. The facilities for visiting teams are appalling, with rooms too small for players, no air conditioning and the need for makeshift ice baths outside toilet cubicles. \* There are no female change or WC areas in the current stadium which means female athletes are required to change in men’s changing and WC/shower areas. \* Facilities for catering staff are second rate. Lack of dedicated ‘break out’ space at the venue often means that staff do not get breaks simply because it is too far for them to walk to the single staff rest area. \* Moving food and drinks to various outlets around the stadium is challenging, not in keeping with modern expectations and highly inefficient. This issue is compounded by a lack of storage spaces, which means food outlets have to be restocked several times during events. This is made worse by the fact that there is no back-of-house circular delivery system which results in staff using the general public concourse to transfer goods. \* There is generally little access to the field of play. Any large items requiring installation need to be located in advance of event operations and require the removal of part of the concourse floor, making it inaccessible for patrons and staff to move around the venue. \* The loading dock is too small and inefficient and removal of waste from the site is difficult. \* Lounges and corporate suites are ageing and are not considered in line with contemporary stadiums nationally. There's plenty more. Like u/Pearlsam said, google the review and it's all there in black and white.
17. A comments section on reddit is probably not the best place to get an answer from. Google the "Sport Venue Review" the state government put out in march. It runs through the reasons the Gabba isn't good.
18. I'd like to know what these urgent and frighteningly expensive renovations are as well. It doesn't seem like it's going to just fall down.
19. Lol nah just start rolling the middle and see what you get.
20. It’s not though. It was built before current accessibility standards and needs significant investment to brought up to code.
21. As someone who works at the stadium as event support, the plumbing is egregious and the stadium is sub-par structurally all around. Check out a comment in this thread by u/[fissionxuiptz](https://www.reddit.com/user/fissionxuiptz/) that outlines the many issues.
22. Watch a game of AFL from the general admission seats. Then get back to me. Horrid experience.
23. Except that the new LNP review, should they stay true to their word will exclude Vic Park as an option. Also, there was only one review. So "every" review is an incorrect statement.
24. That’s probably the only two things the LNP have going for them. It will probably be a depressing four years for any other transit infrastructure though
25. I thought so at first too, but, I’ve never heard someone refer to that option as “Northside” before. I’ve heard northshore thrown up as an option once or twice, plus there’s room for restaurants (whereas, I’m not sure where you’d put them without taking more of the parkland at Vic Park). Keen to understand which they meant.
26. As someone who has lived in the Gabba area for the past 12 years and has seen things like the kangaroo hotel taking 10 years for them to tear it down and to start building (which at the moment they have stopped due to the unsure nature of the Gabba). And had a 8 story complex built one side of me and a current 23 story proposal trying to go forward on the right. Then the whole Stanley street area redevelopment plan (aka where the fires were only a couple of weeks ago) which only came about when the pda was introduced. And that’s only a few of the many examples of development interest only occurring due to the promise of the new Gabba. Why do you think the appartments on Stanley street got built. Because of the view into the Gabba. Which in the past would not have been allowed due to Gabba owning all the area and they didn’t want to have buildings high enough to see into the ground. But the Gabba ran out of money and they had to start giving ownership of the land over. Developers only care about mass profits and things that spike values up. The more you look into it. The more you see it. I’m all for more housing and the push for high density but developers are still in it for themselves.
27. IOC were never paying for a stand lol.. where the fuck do you even get this shit from. QSAC was the most expensive option because it had no transport solution, delivered no legacy benefit, and left Brisbane still needing to upgrade the Gabba which will be end of life by the 2030s, meaning Taxyapers are then paying for an upgrade of something they could have done for the Olympics.
28. It wasn't the archipelago designs. They clearly outlined deleting the driving range and function centre areas to build there. Also, none of their review was costed nor any feasibility studies completed. They just pulled the idea out of their ass and said it was best.
29. Sure, but it doesn't take a review or a genius to recognise that QSAC is a legitimately terrible idea.
30. Not really - you need the land, for a start. Secondly, why would you do it, instead of just going where the infrastructure already is?
31. What? Milton station literally links onto suncorp. You walk slightly up a hill and it's there.
32. I've been to plenty of broncos games which attract large crowds and I can tell you definitively that the idea that most people Commute there by bus or rideshare is absolutely and objectively wrong. The pedestrian traffic from both Milton and Roma Street stations is excellent.
33. It's because the proposal involves increasing the total site area by building over the ICB to link Spring Hill to Victoria Park. In the current Victoria Park masterplan there's something like 56 hectares of publicly accessible green open space, in the Brisbane Bold proposal by Archipelago there is over 60 hectares of publicly accessible green open space.
34. The Gabba will cost 100m per year up to the games to keep it running vaguely safely as per the Quirk report, then another billion afterwards to stop it falling down and providing decent emergency egress and disability access. That is $1.4b according to this article and more likely $1.8- 2b that has to be spent regardless, and even then, it will need to be replaced within a decade of the games anyway because it is rather buggered. There isn't really much choice in that, because the sport needs to be played somewhere ( it employs quite a few people if you didn't realise not to mention providing significant social benefits). Patching up the gabba, which is a pretty poor stadium to begin with, is rather dumb, and definitely a waste of money. QSAC is in the same boat, especially as using it for athletics will necessitate the gabba stupidity. So it is either a rebuild of the gabba or build a new one at Victoria Park. Doing nothing is not an option
35. > I mean we should give this guy a shot to see how he behaves. We know how he behaves. We've seen how he behaved during the campaign. We saw how he behaved and voted during Newman's government. He's not some obscure dude who happened to fall into the big boy chair. We know what kind of person he is. >Love or hate him, he’s here to stay, we’re under one team now, team Queensland. I'm all for Team QLD but Team QLD has just elected a divisive, religious, right-wing party. Forgive me for not being all sunshine and rainbows to people who want me to be a second-class citizen.
36. I mean, why not just put a world class stadium in your back yard? It won't fit? There's your answer about the Gabba.
37. Because the stadium doesn't fit there. And they'd need to build a temporary home for the lions & cricket which is dead money.
38. The site is within a PDA yeah. But I mean a PDA within a PDA if that makes sense. So EDQ become the developer. Like they did with Southport Hospital site.
39. Why? Wouldn't it be good for low income households with young kids to live on the same block as a state primary school?
40. Cheers, that makes alot of sense and thats a shit load of problems. I always wondered why they used basically fancy shade sails as coverage. Good luck new Gov sorting this issue. We'll end up paying for it but looking at that list knocking it down and rebuilding it is the only option, Olympics or not.
41. Please precisely quote the ways in the Gabba doesn’t meet current accessibility standards. Bonus points if you can find any legislation requiring accessibility requirements to be retroactively applied. If it isn’t up to current standards, shouldn’t it be closed right now?
42. The Quirk review and the project validation report is at least two..
43. There was a private consortium proposing a new stadium at Hamilton North shore, I think that was kiboshed recently. There would be to many planes going over the thing for one - is directly under one of the 4 main flight paths
44. Nonsense. Newstead is the same and no stadium there. It’s a community designated area.
45. From their funding agreement, IOC pays for temporary stands
46. Yeah I have seen the photo from the private slideshow where it's in the middle of the park, I just find it funny that it is never questioned and always misrepresented in the media. And the backwards justification for how Vic Park is the best option, fear mongering that the bus infrastructure to QSAC would cost hundreds of millions and cut down acres of trees. Ignoring the significant amounts of habitat that will be lost for the Shooting, Rowing and Whitewater facilities. And ignoring that there already exists a private council road that runs pretty much from the busway to the front entrance of the QSAC stadium.
47. So any part of Vic park is fine, doesn't need to face any scrutiny at all?
48. Plus the massive overpass from the rail side of the road to the stadium side that is explicitly for those rail-commuting crowds.
49. It's a reasonable walk from Roma St as well, for those coming from other lines.
50. Oh neat. Sorry couldn’t see that on the link you provided. Just got a map. Will have another look on a desktop.
51. Plus you should do it when you have federal funds committed
52. Even the Gabba itself doesn’t fit where it is located. Have you driven down Stanely St? I don’t understand how they plan to build a bigger stadium.
53. Funny how I told you that ages ago, and you were like nuh uh I worked on it. edit: lol blocking me me cause you're wrong, pathetic edit 2: This you *[–]shakeitup2017 Anyone who suggests QSAC as a viable option seriously damages their credibility. That is the dumbest possible option of all. It's even dumber than the proposal to temporarily relocate the Lions to Springfield. The Gabba is the right spot. They just need to agree on the scope and design. [–]Deanosity Yeah so dumb to suggest a site that can actually fit the facilities required [–]shakeitup2017 It's not about the site, it's about where it is in relation to where all the people will be staying and how they're going to get there and back [–]Deanosity Of course it is about the site, it's stupid to try and fit an athletics track between Stanley and Vulture, with no warm up facilities on site* And then like not even a month later, you were gobbling up what daddy Quirk told you to think
54. Project validation report?
55. That’s false QSAC was $1.6billion funded by QLD, for a stadium with zero legacy benefit.
56. It doesn't need yet another independent review to choose Vic Park, or, as per my own preference, the Gabba.
57. Yeah, about like 15 hey - it's really easy to smash out
58. It may not be in there, I'm not too sure. But if you're interested, look for the "Roar Deal" Brisbane Lions podcast, episode 54. Fast forward to the 56 minute mark. They interview Peter and he gives a really good explanation of the proposal. Really worth a listen IMO. It basically sold me on the idea and I'm a sceptical and cynical engineer.
59. To be fair a lot of people flipped to Vic park once the full information became available. I know I did.
60. "If I could clarify, the IOC pays for the temporary seating. When there is a seating overlay, that is an expense of the IOC" - State Development Minister Grace
61. Which part of Vic park would that be?
62. Temporary seating and stadium grand stands are not the same thing. To imply that IOC was to pay for 3 of the 4 sides of QSAC is disingenuous. QSAC was estimated as $1.6billion for the demolition and construction of the new podium level; including all ammenities, concourse infrastructure and DDA compliant requirements of the stands, not just the western stand as you implied. The entirety of this $1.6billion was to be funded by QLD taxpayers; the temporary seating, a entirely seperate figure and a yet to be finalised concept was uncosted had yet to be agreed upon with IOC either.
63. frankly, I don't really care. But more so, if Victoria Park were chosen, then choosing the site within Vic Park would take place following that.
64. If you don't know, just vote 'sure whatever, I don't want to ask any critical questions'
65. At some point, though, it's basically five minutes to midnight and you can't lock down all details in yet another Independent Review.
66. One more lane, bro.
67. Elevated roadway is extremely expensive. It's not just construction - it's maintenance and safety.
68. Eww yuck, another free way. I also share you disappointment about lack of east west transport. Would love to see an east west busway (or orbital busway) please no more freeways, all they turn into is a money printing machine for transurban that doesn't reduce traffic.
69. Nah
70. Terrible idea. Next?
71. There’s literally a tunnel already doing that, or at least half of it.
72. Isnt there a train line going in somewhere there?
73. How about a tunnel?
74. Brilliant idea. You should take that to BCC. The Northside is a fkn basket case. They need forward thinkers. Well done. 👍🏼
75. Yes that is correct, but instead of one lane, we elevate these lanes into a motorway so that the car infrastructure we do have creates a grid pattern. We can then fill surrounding streets with PT. Short of pulling up the roads and entire public transport network in brisbane, what we have now will never be sufficient or serve the purpose that is needed for commuting. .
76. He didn’t say that. It’s actually a brilliantly thought out concept and you have just shit on it with your fucking pea sized brain. Good one. 👍🏼
77. Everything is expensive and you pay a cost no matter which way you go.
78. It's not an either or its a both. Cars above and PT above. Both types of infrastructure are needed to create a successful city.
79. You mean the tunnel in the city?
80. Completely agree, the north side is reliant on residential streets to transport traffic, it's an insane approach. By my reckoning cross town motorway at road road and one just past chermisde should do it. Literally from the range to the sea.
81. I can imagine transurban building the Rd, but not going to get the PT. Better yet, just invest in better busways and rails corridors or orbitals.
82. It's moronic. Road building has never led to decreased traffic congestion other than in the very short term.
83. Yeah but that's not a reason to just blow all your resources into an elevated highway.
84. Airport Link has an entrance on Stafford road/Gympie road intersection and you can get out at Sandgate Road or even after that.
85. Yep 👍🏼
86. Road building is the main way to solve increased traffic. FMD 🤦🏻‍♂️
87. Yeah I would suggest a reread of my post. The stafford road entrance is basically the city.
88. I don’t get the negative response in here, the Australian constitution doesn’t provide many rights but one it does is political communication. This is like the one thing you are constitutionally allowed to do so go out and do it.
89. I completely get this, but shouldn't a rally wait until they actually start drafting a bill? Otherwise I can see people considering this just fear mongering.
90. This is so important!! Highlighting that it will not stand is important before a bill gets tabled. The country will support QLD in getting this bill quashed. It's going to happen at some point during this term, I just hope the QLD LNP majorly stuffs up in the next 6 months. We need them to stuff up before the next Federal election, because Price has the same ideas for Australia, except she wants it banned after 12 weeks. If the LNP go well in QLD, the country will end up with Dutton. Just like we ended up with ScoMo because of QLD. Then women around the country will be stuffed. Edit: because I pressed post by accident.
91. Love this, and I will be there. What annoys me is that this took less then a week to organise and I've been hounding people to march against the cost of living and Housing crisis, and it's just crickets no one
92. I’ve never protested in my life, but I promise that for all the woman in my life I will be out there protesting every single time to stop this ❤️
93. To all the people saying “stop worrying the law won’t change” - if the law does change, will you be asking forgiveness from the people who raised warnings and concerns about it?
94. I hope this does not come across as scary as it might seem but it's highly likely that the lobbyist who was behind the 3 most recent anti-choice Bills around Australia (the Qld & Federal 'born alive' Bills and the SA's 'forced birth' Bill) will talk about this rally on her platforms and may even attend the rally to film herself harassing people. Prof. Joanna Howe from the University of Adelaide Law School is the main person behind each of these failed Bills. Howe is a expert in labour migration and does not have any experience in any medical-related field or human rights law. She started her 'Dr Joanna Howe' platform about 2/3 years ago and has been spreading healthcare and human rights disinformation aiming to (as she herself states on her website) "*make abortion unthinkable*". Howe has long worked with Women's Forum Australia and the Australian Christian Lobby and she has good friends in the media too via Gemma Jones, editor at the Advertiser, editor at The Australian and most hosts on Sky News. Howe herself is a conservative Catholic connected with the Disciplines of Jesus Covenant Community and Youth Mission Team Australia. [Here's a fact-check of some of her claims](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10cJfeDBIAYVZklthAT2blcZvcrXsP7lg/view) and I respond to some of her specific stuff [here](https://www.tiktok.com/@prgygrgy). Howe recently crashed a rally against her SA 'forced birth" Bill with her husband (also an influencer) where they filmed themselves accosting various women in the crowd, ignoring police directing them to leave, chased a Minister into the path of oncoming traffic and just some really nasty vitriol. After her Bill was defeated she has started targeting other academics and elected reps inciting violence against those (only women) who spoke against her Bill.
95. planning on going. first political rally for me since the pro-refugee rallies in the mid 1990s... you're never to old to stick up for whats right and proper...
96. Keeping the bastards honest early - I like it
97. I can’t wait for the over 70’s Nimby’s to not be the biggest voting pool by age. I bet most of them voted this lot in for the “adult time…” nonsense out of fear.
98. The irony on doing this on All Saints Day isn't lost.
99. Blame the lnp voters for this shyte
100. Abortion isn’t murder because murder is killing something sentient
101. Should have voted for … not them. Bit of a shut barn door after horse fucked off really.
102. The fact that we have to do this in 2024 is mind numbing
103. Here we Joh again...
104. Cannot believe in this country we have to do this. I'm ashamed this is even an issue. Mind your own business .leave people alone for god sake
105. Going by some of the absolute disgusting comments in here, this is why we need to protest these things all the more. Keep the bastard politicians accountable. Edit: I'm going to add in this image for the special folks in the comments who are getting super butthurt, just to make them feel extra special. 😂 This isn't directed at you OP, just you let you know. Serves as a pretty simple litmus test really, and shows just how many shitty people we have in our community who find it "offensive" that women should have autonomy over their own bodies and health. This applies just as much to women's rights. https://preview.redd.it/uyjumkdamdxd1.jpeg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c1caba081d5337f85d3d24206621c5288f01455
106. Make no mistake, LNP are only against abortion because they want you giving birth to kids so they have more workers to replace. It was never about "Christian values"
107. Thanks for sharing. What pages should I follow to keep updated?
