Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. What they tend to do is sabotage government services that compete with the private sector (often their mates that donate back to them). Like healthcare, a private system benefits when people are forced to use it when public hospitals face cuts. Look at America for how dangerous that could become if they got what they want. Since Medicare was introduced, they have tried to gut/destroy it. They always will, its in their interests and they dont have to participate in the system they ruin. They often can afford to live protected from their own damage. The other worst thing they also do, is let our state atrophy. They often lack vision and only represent existing interest groups. They thus hinder or dont bother with investments that would drastically reform the state for the future. Looking at the NBN in particular for that one.... that could have put us ahead of the digital revolution, but nah, copper was better, and then it costed far more and fucked that up. (Which also competed with their interest groups, Murdock's foxtel services for example.) They are also largely dominated by the worst kind of Christians, the kind that feel that the state should enforce some/all of their believes, because they often think they operate a higher moral standard that everyone should follow. Ever heard one say "we should be/used to be a christian nation". (And to those types. Fuck you, we shouldn't have to live by your bs rules that you hypocritically often fail to follow). Often a means to feel better than others, rather than following any true christian teachings of loving and helping your neighbor. Thus they lack action on issues that help the LGBT community, or actively try to fuck them over, and then also push insane views on abortion. Like yeah, it sounds reasonable you shouldn't abort a 8 or 9 month term baby, till you think that one through for more than 2 seconds and realize that its only done for dire medical emergency's and thus these views get people killed/fucked up majorly. Often because they just hate the idea of people having sex outside of marriage, and thus you should "suffer the consequences" (some even for procreation). On the economy, well they dont really give a shit about the state beyond their own interests. They are often carrier driven people at best, and driven by insane ideology's at worst. The economy does worse under them and they often push us into debt. Which stems from the lack of investments, loss of assets they sold to their mates (who donate back to them), and tax cuts to things like coal mining company's. Who just get to dig up our resources and sell them, with a lot of that money going overseas, when it should be fueling the growth of our state. The environment will also suffer, they tend to cut back regulations that require mines to fix a lot of their damage, and also things that prevent massive tree clearing. under the lnp their record on treee clearing can often be compared to bloody brazil.... Because there is a bit of money to be made for some today, thus the environment gets permanently destroyed. They are often also just really dumb and out of touch, they are appointed to represent interest groups that exist, not push for a better future or running a state effectively. Be nice if democracy could be a choice between more than just, a party that can run things at worst vs effectively a parasitic entity. They very rarely fix the issues they campaign on, youth crime will get worse under them, crime always does. They cut the services that help those desperate enough to turn to crime/break the cycle of poverty/abuse that leads to such crime.
2. I recommend starting by reading the policy platforms of each party. Good luck finding it for LNP. The Greens’ policy initiatives are at https://greens.org.au/qld/plan . Will there be change. Yep. Do we know what? Nope, because the LNP never actually committed to anything tangible. Labor’s 50c fares were actually a watered down Greens initiative from the previous election which they carried through to the latest election as free public transport. Thanks to the costs of administering the ticketing system and enforcement it would actually cost the state about the same each year to charge nothing as to charge 50c per fare. The LNP have not indicated a plan to toughen abortion laws - what would “toughen” even mean in this context? What they have done though is repeatedly evade reasonable questions about their government’s handling of any bill that might be tabled with intent to repeal the current law passed in 2018, prior to which abortion under any circumstances was a crime in Queensland. As their own internal party rules dictate that any change to abortion law would require a “conscience vote” Mr Crisafulli’s claim that he could guarantee no change was an outright lie. But lies are his bread and butter. Like the lie that youth crime is out of control. By any measure youth crime rates are currently at a twenty year low. On this fact every state and federal crime and criminology authority agree. Yet they claim they will fix this problem that doesn’t actually exist. What they won’t do is address any of the specific types of crime that have increased in recent years. Most concerningly family and domestic violence, alcohol fueled assault and rape are all increasing. But the LNP have no plans to improve DV support and training within the QPS or to address the housing and cost of living crises that are driving these kinds of violence. They have no plan to fix the housing supply and demand imbalance by building affordable housing or eliminating tax handouts for rich property investors that are stopping first home buyers getting into a home. Because they are the ones profiting from it. In short neither Labor nor the LNP had any credible plan to really address the issues hurting Queenslanders. Their goal was simply to win the election at any cost and worry about how to pay for it later. The millions each of those two parties receive in donations from multinational mining companies and huge corporations all but ensure nothing much will be done to benefit voters that might negatively impact those donors. So expect more coal and gas leases, more heel dragging on transition to renewable energy and cleaner industry, more putting off meeting our global emission target obligations, more homelessness, more unlimited rent increases, more grocery price gouging, higher public education costs, more medical complications due to unaffordable health care, more suicides, fewer trade apprentices, more government interference in patient-doctor affairs, more back slapping with fat rich pricks, more poor kids falling through the cracks and, ironically, more crime. It’s gonna be a pretty shit 4 years. I hope you make it.
3. Assuming they will do what they say they will, less oversight and more money flowing into the coal and gas bohemoths and less money into renewables. More kids in jails to meet and join groups of people in jails that have shown time and time again to no actually help. The cycle continues.
4. Nothing will change, the same old broken promises and bad management
5. At best, selling this state to the homegrown oligarchs At worst, selling this state to the Russian and Chinese oligarchs
6. The usual LNP thing will happen. Cuts everywhere and the savings passed on to their mining and business mates. They will back policy that is pushed by the ultra religious elements of the party as they have been getting more and more influence in the party every year. So expect the tightening on abortion laws. I fully expect a backflip on the no nuclear so they align with Dutton and his horribly ill thought out nuclear plan that doesn't even stack up to his own details let alone to reality of how it would really work. Labour might suck and only manage to help some people but at least they try where as the LNP actively work against everyone except their own rich mates.
7. Do the vote compass
8. The first thing they'll do is legislate record low mining royalties. And they'll lock them in for 20 years.
9. Politicians of all persuasions are well known for backtracking on election promises. No doubt some will be fulfilled but this will be difficult in a hung parliament if thus b isbwaht happens.
10. As a rule of thumb, vote on who or what represents you best. Not your friends or family
11. The only things Chrisafuli promised that his party is ideologically committed to are allowing mining companies to profit and pollute more, gutting ministries and departments, and allowing abortion to be re-criminalised.
12. They're going to throw all the Aboriginal kids in jail and repeal abortion.
13. You'll be old enough to vote by 2028. My best advice to you is stay engaged. Ignoring politics outside of elections is bad business, for everyone. We have to stay engaged, keep paying attention, keep speaking out if the government tries to implement bad policies. All we can do is wait and see. Crisafulli says he won't decimate the public service and healthcare system like he did last time. But I also know he has a history of going back on his word. I'm also old enough to remember the Newman government, it's why the LNP spent a decade in opposition. The optimist in me believes the Liberals won't try Newman 2.0 ... The cynic in me and my gut instinct says otherwise. So again, my best advice, stay engaged, make sure you enroll when you turn 18 and pay attention to what is happening in politics. Read as much objective information as you can when you can, so that when you do vote, you'll be able to make an informed decision based on what you want out of your government 👍
14. First quarter, nothing. ride the train blame labor for everything. 2nd 1/4. start selling assets, blame labor for the need to sell them. 3rd holiday mode, blame labor for as they continue to sell services. 4th: brag about how much money they made, how great the budget looks, blame labor the jobs crisis and cost of living issues we will be facing, premier to personally suck off the CEO of coles and woolworths (blame labor for the mess they leave on the floor)
15. Politics is absolutely important. You really don't need to be a political wizz, but it is detrimental to your future living condition to be absent minded about politics. If you don't care about politics, you are basically saying that you don't care how you're going to be living in the future. It could be that voting now, could prevent you from having to live in desperation in the future. Think of it this way, you don't need ambulance insurance in QLD, if you need an ambulance, it's free, why? Politics, and it's only the case in Queensland, the other states do not get this luxury. Medicare used to be a whole lot better, but it's stagnated over the past decade and now no longer covers the entirety of a doctor's appointment, why? Politics. If you "don't care about politics" then you are signing yourself up to sleepwalk into your worst possible future. You'll only care about politics when it's too late.
16. Watch Victoria your preference might change
17. It's going to be hard gauging a response from reddit as I have a feeling most reddit users in Australia would be leaning to the left. The amount of pro/bashing left/right side of politics I don't think is reflective of the real world as most of the noise is coming from the left who, as the results speak for themselves, are in the minority.
18. If you like labor, you’ll love the Greens. Seriously check out www.greens.org.au/qld/plan
19. I've never understood how people become so passionate about politics. Nothing ever changes. The only thing that remains consistent is lies and broken promises. The two major political parties (exactly like the US) are two sides of the same coin dressed up in different meat suits and logos and they have us fooled making us believe it's a democracy. Letting politics control your emotions and dictate your life is one of the worst ways to live. This is why I donkey vote; nothing changes or ever will change, and you're an oblivious slave to modern society if you really believe our votes and opinions matter.
20. You’ll find that Steve was appealing to a target demographic that was more likely to shift their votes towards him. Even with that huge campaign, he didn’t stay in. Queensland is a big broad state with many different people from all walks of life. More of those people believed that LNP would provide a better outcome, or rather more believed that ALP had their time. Youth crime is a very topical point. There are a wide range of views but ultimately there are good arguments for both. A lot of the offending does happen because as a minor they get a slap on the wrist, and I believe as a minor they cannot cite past offences at all (unless the minor brings it up) so they continue to get a slap on the wrist based on precedence. Personally I don’t agree with LNP anti abortion ideals, but I think that is the result of the noisy minority inside LNP. I think overall they will perform better than ALP but time will tell, I can’t say for sure. From a politics perspective, I have quite a libertarian view. Everyone is equal regardless of demographic. No favouritism or anything for gender or colour. Maintained and improved access to recreational liberties. Hunting on public land (in reasonable places; state forest, remote national park, pests in conservation reserves etc). We should all have equitable access to public land. If something is declared sacred we should look after it, but also be able to experience it in some capacity; see Lake Tali Karng. Freedom of expression and choice is important to me
21. There may be a bit less resources spent on treaty, truth-telling and reperations.. https://www.dsdsatsip.qld.gov.au/our-work/aboriginal-torres-strait-islander-partnerships/reconciliation-tracks-treaty/tracks-treaty/path-treaty
22. cheap electricity ⚡️
23. [removed]
24. "what ive heard about LNP is that there going to toughen abortion laws and make youth crime worse (putting bigger prison sentences is not changing a thing, work on the quality of life so the kids get raised better)" Are you asking a question, or making a statement? The election is over. You can stop campaigning now.
25. Yes, this Queensland thread is going to become quiet.
26. this especially the bit about football teams. The reason we have issues in our society is because about 2/3rds of voters support the same party no matter what they do. Best advice is to fact check everything if it concerns you. Also be aware a government can't instantly change things. some things might take years to fix, if they even want to fix them.
27. Thanks for the advice, you saying ill be 70 one day does sound weird tho😂
28. This is great advice!
29. That’s a great attitude to have. The days of blindly following some party should be over. We should be smarter than that!
30. At the same time has the LNP/Coalition of Liberal/National/Country parties ever not been shit? Go back 70 years through QLD politics. It’s gerrymandering, corruption and fuck the working class.
31. Yeh that's all very nice, but I've been waiting 40 years for the chance to vote LNP.... they've never given me enough reason to.
32. “If you are not a swinging voter, you are dangerous” my friend’s dad.
33. Don't forget selling assets like our generators/grid and Energy QLD
34. Don’t underestimate what changing the preferential voting system will do. It advantages the LNP. If they try and bring it in, we need to hit the streets. It’s a backwards step for democracy and it’s democracy we need to protect.
35. I don't like the bloke, but he explicitly said there will be no changes to abortion laws under his government. Is he lying? I guess we'll see.
36. You say he has officially pledged to remove coal royalties and wind back the clock on abortion rights. You then put in brackets that he has not actually said that. OP these are the exact kind of emotionally charged political comments you should ignore or at the least be wary of. There’s virtually zero chance the LNP go after abortion. It would be political suicide in Australia. Like end of the party level suicide. They have not campaigned on it. If they tried to do it, the protests would be insane and the GC would likely have to dissolve parliament and force another election at which the LNP would be annihilated. It simply will not happen and was never more than an effective Labour scare campaign. • ⁠literally watch it not happen.
37. and/or the Joh years...
38. Alright thanks i will. I do know that he was a LNP member and not liked alot but im not to sure why, Ill ask my dad. Thanks.
39. This is so grim
40. What I don't get is that "Youth Crime" was a significant part of this election, but the Police stats show that Youth Crime in QLD was falling under the ALP now so why is it an issue?
41. Anyone knows how or why they are changing political donation rules? Seems like opening of more pathways to corruption
42. Coal tax reform is gone, no more 50c fares - these will be quietly withdrawn in a few months time, coincidentally after some other issue randomly appears.
43. >but we are a democracy and the population has changed the gov so it is what it is. We are a democracy now. When he gets rid of preferential voting, we will no longer be a true democracy. Truly terrifying policy, but Queenslanders voted for it.
44. Yes! And do it a few times until you are 30, as your views change. It’s important to vote with your values!
45. He'll just sack public servants, outsource their work, and call them private sector jobs (even though the govt is still paying)
46. If parents bothered to parent their children there wouldn’t be the need for them to be pissed off about searches.
47.

48. Sounds like you are describing fascism to me.
49. It won’t be relevant to the OP, unless he is a POS and deserves to be in prison….
50. Or you could be a decent human being and vote for a better world for everyone?
51. It will change. Not one environment NGO is welcoming LNP. Not one community development org is welcoming LNP. They are environmental and social vandals
52. The artificial categories of left and right are just a pervasive nonsense to keep you thinking like a football supporter. There are simply policies that are either socially responsible, equitable and address the root causes of systemic disadvantage or that ignore those issues because they only affect someone else. The LNP are firmly in the “looking after myself, fuck everyone else” group. Labor are somewhat in both of those camps these days as they try to appeal to lifetime Liberal/National voters. And the Greens are all about everyone receiving and contributing their fair share and levelling-up everyone’s starting point so we all get a chance to achieve in a capitalist society. Don’t think based upon the election result that people desiring equity and a fair go for all are the minority. A large part of this outcome resulted from multi-million dollar media disinformation campaigns, blatant lies that were believed by the gullible and widespread apathy and ignorance of how our political system actually works. The way to effectively address the latter is through more spending on our dismally underfunded public education system but that is now pretty unlikely for another 4 years as the LNP only want education for the wealthy.
53. Electricity cheaper under LNP? You'd have to be dumber than dog shit to believe that.
54. Why’s that exactly mate? You wanna explain your point or just cry out at a 17 year old trying to understand the politics that affect him?
55. So 75% of the LNP voter base would be out because of that 2nd one
56. Oh fuck yes I love merit based voting that's such a good idea that definitely is not a major discriminator against young and low socio-economic background people
57. 17 year olds will live with our voting choices long after we’re dead. If anything it’s the people with a 50/50 chance of living out the term that shouldn’t be voting. They have less skin in the game.
58. can you help? this is just plain unkind, haha
59. I think their statement of what they've heard includes an opinion - OP seems to be wondering if what they've heard (the statement) is true, and shared a bit of their own opinion on one of the things they've heard can you help OP? did you want to say it's not true? I feel like it could be very helpful to OP and others reading to know if what a lot of people are hearing is true as we all have our own opinions! I feel like being sarcastic(?) can be seen as rude for no reason when they're asking for help. I'm sorry if the perception of this is wrong though!! just, your own last sentences don't seem very kind or informative -- also sorry I wrote a lot, unsure if your own question is genuine 😅
60. There are many things the legislative arm of govt can change rapidly, especially without a balancing bicameral parliament. Even then, there are many changes to the running of day to day govt that can be impacted.
61. What if no matter how bad one party gets, the other one is always worse?
62. To be fair, it'd help a lot of we had some credible parties that aren't just the major two. Like LNP vs KAP/ON (et al) isn't really a choice of policy or views but how much chaos & shitfuckery you can tolerate. Same thing for the Greens and APL.
63. Actually I meant 87 haha, but yeah same same. World will change an incredible lot in that time, would love to be able to time travel to the year 2094 and ask you to reflect
64. I know the feeling and I’ve just turned 70.
65. you are the person that comment OP is warning post OP not to become like lmaoo.
66. In the context of this thread your reply is not helpful, and the exact thing I’ve warned the 17yo about. FO with your propaganda
67. [deleted]
68. I suppose you missed the footy team reference too
69. He said he won't change the law. But he has not answered when asked if he will put forward a conscience vote, which would have the same result, and he's been asked it a lot.
70. It is Katter that will table the bill and the LNP do individual conscience votes. So he’s not exactly lying, HE’s not going to make a change but they will still vote to criminalise it if/when Katter puts his bill up.
71. If it changes, KAP will table the bill and he will allow a conscience vote, then he can weasel word say it wasn't him.
72. He also said he would keep the 50c bus fares.
73. Only person 100% lying is the person who posted the comment saying he refused to clarify
74. After the effect of that possibility, don't think he will think about it this term. Plus big donations are from coal companies. So I think he will do what coal companies paid him to do and then with whatever left over he will try to secure votes for next term. So I'm expecting stuff on coal, nuclear, privatisation etc. Not expecting him to bring up abortion and he will beg katter privately to shut up about abortion. If his team isn't united, then he won't last full term.
75. LNP in SA went after abortion rights. LNP in QLD will 100% go after abortion rights.
76. The LNP aren't going to table the bill, but enough of them (including Chrisafuli) are staunchly anti-abortion, so when the Katter party table it, it will get through. Chrisafuli will then say that he just promised not to introduce the bill himself.
77. > im not to sure why He sacked 12,000 public servants as soon as he got elected, brought in draconian anti-bikie laws and tried to lease state assets out for 99 years to private companies. Expect the same sort of stuff from Crisafulli over the next four years.
78. Like taking your kid to the hospital after hours cos there's no other option and being sent away because of all the staff cuts
79. Public service was/is full of a lot of useless people and many of the comments you read on reddit don’t like the fact that they actually had to go and do some real work or they lost their jobs..
80. It's not an issue, it's just a misconception drilled into the public by a mixture of media sensationalism from News Corps and Nine and the wide spread of anecdotes driven by community groups online and social media algorithms.
81. Because it’s falling in SEQ and not the rest of the state. Furthermore I understand there are more repeat offenders - which means whatever methods are being used to stop them isn’t working and they go straight back to it.
82. You answered your own question.
83. Considering the Greens refuse all corporate donations because it negatively impacts the political process, then yes, changing the laws to make the LNP richer, more powerful and corrupt is not a good development
84. I think the plan was to turn it from mandatory to voluntary. You can either choose to give your preferences or not give them..
