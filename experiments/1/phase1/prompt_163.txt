Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. What bias? In which direction? The votes are 2PP LNP 54:46 and the ABC still thinks the LNP will only get 48 seats. This is before the bulk of postal votes that typically break towards conservative parties in Australia. The math, ain‚Äôt math in‚Äô Governments lose elections more than Opposition parties win government. Party hacks just need to get over it, rightly or wrongly, blame gets assigned and most people don‚Äôt want a party to hold office perpetually. Now the coping begins. ‚Äú54% 2PP for the LNP is a W for us!‚Äù ‚ÄúThe LNP is divided!‚Äù The truest of true believers.
2. The aircraft noise stuff is the weirdest hill for them to die on. Absolutely nonsensical policy to curfew an airport in 2024 with no other alternative, aside from "just make every flight take off and land over the bay".
3. House prices still went up in covid when there was near to no demand. People need to start reading some research thats not funded by private property investors or murdoch.
4. 100% agree
5. They‚Äôre not the Palestine party. They just happen to be the only party supporting Palestine while Israel conducts its genocide and continues its apartheid.
6. üíØ
7. I think the rot started with adam bandt. Richard di natale i felt did a good job pushing the greens vision.
8. Agree
9. Examples?
10. This is so true
11. Since their literal conception, the core values have been: Peace and nonviolence Ecological sustainability Social justice Grassroots democracy Which of their policies do you think are no longer in line with their core values? Or are you a murdoch bot?
12. The LNP won because they ran a scare campaign in FNQ with "yuff crime iz guna steal ya cars!!!!!" and people believed it, despite statistics literally suggesting otherwise. The reality is, despite me not voting for Labor either, the cost of living measures the coal royalties subsidised was putting this state in the best place it could have during cost of living. I haven't paid an electricity bill in 6 months; my rego was under $250, and I have been taking advantage of the 50c fares. Crisafulli has pledged to remove coal royalties. Say goodbye to cost of living. Oh and say goodbye to health and government workers, since the LNP has traditionally sacked these workers to pay for... cost of living. It's so backwards and you'd laugh if it wasn't the reality.
13. Banning election donations just entrenches the two party system which is exactly why Labor wants it.
14. Ok but they did get idea from the Greens and from what I saw the Greens hardly ran that story? As a greens voter I wanted them to claim it more. Labor and LNP literally laughed it off in 2017, 2020 and even in the March Brisbane Council elections. Its very obviously a Greens policy and is evidence that more folks voting Greens is good for moving major parties to the left.
15. They‚Äôre also dead wrong on nuclear and with fish ramps and other mitigation methods, wrong about hydroelectricity. They‚Äôre a misinformed, anti science party of obstructionism and pointless whining.
16. The greens shit on Labor constantly. Why would Labor want to "run with them"?
17. Spot on.
18. They massivly improved the HAFF legislation and now Labor are shit scared of even talking to them in case they get more credit for actually wanting do shit to help address the cost of living crisis.
19. I'm pissed at the shit doing to Labor federally. They aren't helping to solve anything. They should be made to take Lydia Thorpe back too. /s
20. Specific examples?
21. Ya really think that ALP would have come up with 50c public transport fares, and LNP would have hitched to that wagon if the Greens hadn't been pushing it for a few years. The idiot public don't hold the government of the day to account for inaction, but somehow a minor party with 2 MPs were meant to be able to change the world and it's all there fault things are still shit. At least McMahon and Berkman asked the more difficult questions at Estimates instead of the usual cosy arrangement that the ALNP have.
22. You‚Äôre clueless. At each election since he got in the vote went up and up and up. He donated half his salary to fund community grants that Council were too broke to provide, brought in a free bus loop for South Brisbane, developed participatory budgeting (all residents had a vote in how the Ward budget was used), and locals loved him. Stop reading murdoch and chat to some locals before spreading BS
23. Their support for Hamas (because that what it is) is enough to always put them last from now on. It‚Äôs an absurd position to have.
24. > The Greens 1st preference vote grew. You're thinking of outdated numbers. The count currently stands at a 0% swing for the Greens.
25. Exactly. People on here can‚Äôt seem to fathom why on earth they lost while every normal working class individual is watching all the protests and shilling for hamas like wtf are these clowns on. Most of us are out here just trying to survive and meanwhile watch electricity prices go up and up and up while were forced into yet more terrible deals, we watch our roads fall apart in regional QLD until of course the eve of an election and magically they all get fixed in the span of a couple months, we all remember being locked up inside and forced into ridiculous mask etc rules despite clear evidence they had no effect. I think the majority of QLD is sick of being ignored while labor enjoys the ‚Äúsure thing‚Äù doing whatever they want thinking they‚Äôll never lose cause well just keep voting for them, and the greens, the greens are the ultimate hard left if labor is intolerable being the way they are why on earth would the greens get any seats at all at that point
26. Lotta buzzwords, not a lot of sense.
27. Lmaoooo this is such a low IQ comment. Tell me what Greens policies you disagree with, and what policies of the majors you agree with. Can't wait.
28. Evidence? Examples?
29. Ok grandpa, time for your nap.
30. The math ain‚Äôt mathing
31. at this point FNQ should secede and install Bob as King.
32. So why not vote 1 greens, then 2 Labor?
33. I don‚Äôt think you are the only one. From my purely anecdotal view, across the country greens seem to do even better when the liberal option doesn‚Äôt look horrendous or if labour is a great chance of winning anyway. It then drops back a bit when it‚Äôs a tight contest and greens voters want to make 100% sure a liberal doesn‚Äôt get in
34. I think there's a lot of this. Ppl know that it'll be tight and might not go to preferences so take the safe bet and put Labor first instead of second behind the greens .
35. You make a lot of very confident assertions here and the only thing you have to back it up is an election vote that is only about 70% complete... Sure the greens haven't had a great election but you're making huge generalisations about Qld voter rationale which is very different across seats. You're opinion on housing is ludicrous, the policies proposed by Labor have not been "good policies," they're been average at best. The greens have only blocked the HAFF (where they held out for more) and are currently blocking "Help to buy" which is another brain-dead policy which primarily increases demand. If Labor we're serious about fixing housing, they would remove the capital gains exemption and negative gearing (which economists all agree is a good move) but Labor refused to touch them. The way all of this is reported is more of the problem than the actual policies. The media report that the greens are "blocking housing" ignoring the fact that they're blocking in order to improve the outcomes. Labor also refuses to argue on the merits of policy and either attack Max Chandler Mather/ the greens or parrot "supply, supply, supply" and act like the demand side of the equation doesn't exist. Your assertions about our "highly educated and highly paid" voter base is really not at all true and if you had ever attended a doorknock, rally or any other greens event you might know this. I'd say that the biggest indicator of a greens voter would be empathy. This segways nicely in the war in Gaza. The greens aren't a group of Machiavellian pieces of shit. We support Palestine because it's the right thing to do. If that's unpopular with Australians, that's only because they've been brainwashed by Murdoch to think that this conflict is some ongoing drama in the middle east rather than a powerful colonisers country stealing land and running an apartheid state. I really really hate when people try and politicise our stance on Gaza. You also mention "extreme positions." The green's policies really aren't particularly extreme at all but get labelled as such by the media. Eg. Wanting to tax corporations properly, higher royalties on our minerals, fully funding schools, actually build more housing. This is all standard, reasonable policy and it's neo-liberal brain rot that seems to think we're proposing some radical communist idea.
36. The Greens have not been on a campaign to win the Muslim vote! They continue to seek justice for all, and the Palestinians are being systematically wiped out, so they stand up for what‚Äôs right.
37. Anyway, they'd vote the Animal Justice Party, which does quite well in Victoria (and has credible members of the upper house). In QLD progressive non-mainstream voters who don't like the socialist policies of the Greens went for the Legalise Cannabis party, by the looks of it.
38. We can't live without mining, I've been I mining for as long as I've been working, but we need to tax it better, it's bullshit tax at the moment
39. Simp harder
40. I find it fascinating that all these people who hate mining and want it to stop also wanted all of Miles‚Äô and the Greens‚Äô policies that were going to be funded by mining and therefore required reliance on mining in perpetuity to make them possible.
41. They literally got 3B$ through HAFF negotiations...
42. Yep, that's what you did.
43. It sounds like folks were using federal greens as a reason not to vote qld greens and yet doing the opposite for Labor (when fed labor is now clearly centre/centre-right). Minor parties held to a different standard
44. It sounds like folks were using federal greens as a reason not to vote qld greens and yet doing the opposite for Labor (when fed labor is now clearly centre/centre-right). Minor parties held to a different standard
45. Greens need to reconsider protest as their primary mechanism. I get you want to push Labor to be more progressive but it‚Äôs pushing centrists further right in the process. We lose more left votes than we gain with Greens focus on attacking Labor.
46. >But because the major parties have all the media and ideological dominance, they can trot out these lines again and again, and people will believe them. This is such a tired line. KAP and the Independent in Noosa showed that you don't need media dominance to win if the platform is truly popular with the electorate. Same with the Greens last election. If you have ideological dominance because your platform is popular, that sounds like how its supposed to be.
47. It was the Greens themselves who predicted they would win seats. They believed their policies would win votes and win seats. The mainstream media didn't invent that. You might blame a conspiracy. But then we can still ask what changed, since despite that, they are losing seats that they previously won. Has the anti-Green conspiracy become more effective, or is their a policy problem? One is more comforting than the other, but that doesn't make it the correct analysis.
48. Allah
49. Love it!
50. You can put false words in my mouth with quotations all you want. That‚Äôs not what I said and it‚Äôs not true. The question was ‚Äúwhy have voters abandoned the greens‚Äù, as a greens voter I‚Äôm telling you why I would be reluctant to vote for them again in the future and why I suspect many moderate left leaning people already have. I vote for the greens not because I think they‚Äôll get in, but because our preferential voting system means there‚Äôs a chance they have a larger sway in encouraging more considerate environmental and progressive social policies. I want my kids to see the reef, I want to see coal phased out, weed legalised and drugs decriminalised, native species and habitat protected. Instead I‚Äôm seeing performative posturing about an international conflict that has incredibly minor geopolitical implications for Australia and obstructing any new polices put forward that might help ease the housing crisis. As well as a general drift away from the core values of the party to appeal to fringe minorities. I think the polarisation of politics is a major issue at the moment and both the left and right have some soul searching to do as they continue to alienate their core voter bases. You saw what happened to the LNP in the last federal election and you‚Äôre seeing what happening to the greens now. Unfortunately I think the left has serious introspection issues as evidenced by the fact that instead of considering my opinion as a frustrated greens voter, you just resort to saying I hate minorities?
51. They raise a good point lmao. The Greens‚Äô focus should be on how they can improve Australia for Australians and its environment through policy. It sucks what‚Äôs happening in Palestine at the moment but if I‚Äôm a voter with pressures stemming from life in Australia I probably wouldn‚Äôt care‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd want to vote for the party that promises to do right by me
52. Do you listen to the ABC radio? Promotion of homosexuality, mental illness, pro immigration, and feminism take up considerable air time on left leaning media; it's very tone deaf.
53. It's not wishful thinking, it's dealing with late counted votes being much more LNP favourable. These will hurt the Greens. Due to the poor LNP campaign the early votes (the last counted confusingly) were unusually different to on the day votes. The projection algorithms are catching up. The Greens are probably done for. It's just desserts.
54. As somebody very likely in the same electorate as old mate up there‚Ä¶ the Greens throw random nobodies at every single election here. Council, State, Federal upper and lower. With one major exception, all of our greens candidates get announced last minute, have no experience or campaign to speak of, and disappear right after the elections. They‚Äôre seat fillers to ensure that there is actually a box labelled ‚ÄòGreens‚Äô at each election. In four years time it‚Äôs almost guaranteed to be a different unheard of candidate. It‚Äôs a far cry from some of the more clear greens policies and more vocal candidates we‚Äôve seen in some historical elections. I get it, they‚Äôll never win here, it‚Äôs hard to devote a million bucks to a full blown campaign, but still. I reckon it does little to grow local support, and if anything may turn a number of voters to labor first over greens, as at least labor has the pull for some of getting things done when in power.
55. 100kg bench press at the very least /s
56. > Maybe the commentariat have an inkling that the votes yet to be counted will trend towards LNP? Pre-poll votes tend to favour the LNP due to their commanding lead earlier on in the campaign, and those are among the latter votes counted since the votes at the booths are counted as soon as it hits 6pm, meanwhile pre-poll isn't really counted until the Sunday.
57. Yeah, crowbarring all this wokeness into everything is getting old
58. Imagine what housing will be like in 20years if the environment they‚Äôre built in is cooked?
59. Everyone has equal rights in Australia, ya muppet
60. Gay communism. Yeah you don't sound biased whatsoever
61. Evidence? Examples?
62. Yeah literally. MCM is a great example of how the Greens overcome a broken system with sheer selflessness. While Labor wanted a another re-election to offer much needed school meals, Max is using his own salary to fund 30,000 school brekkies and 20,000 community dinners.
63. Yeah agreed.
64. Get your facts right to start with
65. Yeah it was getting pretty hard to hold my membership there for a while. Hopefully the ALP Right don‚Äôt use this an opportunity to say they lost because of the economic reforms they were pushing this election. If anything the only thing that saved them was that they‚Äôve pretty much solidified around abortion. It‚Äôs a shame that the Federal Party is captured lock and key by Neoliberal thinking.
66. They are spot on though, if for example exactly 15% of every electorate voted for the greens you‚Äôd have a huge number of greens voters, but you‚Äôd still win 0 seats. The greens have a lot of support, but the way things shake out for each electorate matters more than the raw number of voters across the state.
67. It's pretty true though, and One Nation has a similar problem. KAP has about 1/3rd the vote of either of them, and yet they have 3 seats and are competitive in another couple, because their voters are much more concentrated in a handful of NQ seats, while the Greens and One Nation voters are spread out all over the state.
68. Actually it's quite accurate, sadly.
69. Hi, I'm a former Brisbane resident, turned Cairns resident because my rent went up so exponentially we had to move 1700kms to live with the parents. My vote still went to the Greens but it doesn't make much difference up here in Hicksville
70. Said by the astroturfer/bot
71. Funny how Sydney and Adelaide airports are still viable with a curfew. Why TF do airports need to operate 24/7? The noise affects a lot wider area than right by the airport. Hopefully the new flight routes "sharing" the noise will give you an appreciation for what a 2am A380 sounds like.
72. MCM aint dying on some hill for aircraft noise. Look at any of his media releases or social media and you‚Äôll see that he‚Äôs fighting for the exact things OC claims he‚Äôs forgotten. He‚Äôs literally the Greens spokesperson for housing and homelessness
73. Well they got your vote, shame about the rest.
74. Hahahaha, downvoted for agreeing with facts.
75. Shit started going downhill after Ludlam left.
76. Adam Bandt clearly stated he is rotten to the core with his statement after the election. The greens need to get back to their grass roots. Right now I think people only vote greens because they don't want to vote for anyone else, I'm yet to meet someone that has said they voted for greens because of X policy. The fact legalise cannabis party got more votes than greens proves how shit they are.
77. More garbage, they aren't the same, Bob Brown was grounded and the greens were a fair voice in the field. Now they talk shit about everything. Their core values have changed, like night and day.
78. By the way, the evidence that their core values have changed is their own website. It used to say: # Party & Policy ‚ÄúOur vision is for a fair, independent and sustainable Australia.‚Äù Why not educate yourself: [The Australian Greens](https://web.archive.org/web/20070522124137/http://www.greens.org.au/about/)
79. You can keep telling people of NQ and FNQ what their lived experience is but they won‚Äôt listen, we‚Äôre used to SEQ gaslighting and trying to tell us what it‚Äôs like up here without ever having been here. Crime rates in QLD overall is trending down. Crime rates in specific regions (including NQ and FNQ) have been trending up. The lived experience is that it is problematic and a ‚Äútough on crime‚Äù message resonates with the community. Keep your head buried in the sand if you like, a change in government may or may not improve crime rates in these parts of the state but after 9 years in government it was apparent ALP weren‚Äôt going to be doing anything to improve things.
80. The smartest possible move a government can make is getting rid of healthcare workers. That way, when people inevitably get sick or injured (which is practically a guarantee), there won‚Äôt be enough staff to help them, leading to poorer outcomes which will affect the economy and state as a whole for many various reasons.
81. Typical ALP members and voters with white collar jobs think: The average voter hates mining companies and wants to bleed them dry, no one they know has a job in this industry Crime rates can‚Äôt be manipulated and the media hand in hand with the ALL in hiding the racial identity of violent offenders is somehow promoting social harmony and tolerance Taxing the hell out of mining, buying a home whilst giving pittances on public transport and school lunches for incompetent parents somehow addresses the cost of living crisis Having a communist (a literal communist) like Jackie Trad shut down sand mining without a proper analysis is a valid ecological policy Maybe Plibersek shutting down a mine in NSW for no reason at all in NSW spook the electorate Albanese is so popular and economically successful it bleeds into State politics You can insult religious people and it will make them vote for you Everyone loves abortion, even to the point where we should coerce doctors to perform non-emergency abortions TL;DR: QLD Labor lost hard because they‚Äôre in a bubble and believe arrogantly that insulting those who won‚Äôt join them is endearing and charming - like good sore losers of history, they blame nefarious third parties for their failures - you know, the Je‚Ä¶I mean the damned MURDOCH PRESS!
82. There are extremely good economic reasons to be against nuclear in Australia. The business case simply doesn't stack up.
83. You keep responding with this. Google your own shit
84. Duh... the greens have become a hateful, marxist/ maoist party run by people with a very thin and nasty idea of how society MUST be run. And woe betide you if you disagree in any way. No different to the worst examples in history, such Stalin, Mao and many others.
85. I will never vote for them again
86. At the time I posted they had a + swing, but this whole post is out of date because the Greens now do have one seat. You‚Äôre going to get tired if you fact check every historical comment.
87. > we all remember being locked up inside and forced into ridiculous mask etc rules despite clear evidence they had no effect. I was with you until this part. Covid likely had *nothing* to do with this election result, considering the restrictions were actually pretty popular at the time, and the government that introduced them was re-elected *during* Covid in an election the LNP were expected to win.
88. What were their policies for south Brisbane? I couldn‚Äôt tell you apart from derailing the Gabba rebuild and stopping the school being relocated. Neither of those policies are good in my view. I found Amy to be a very underwhelming representative for the area. I‚Äôm glad we are returning to a labor MP. I previously voted green.
89. Robbie's grandfather won that federal seat, and Bob Katter represents it currently.
90. Maths*
91. I preferred the experience of the labour member we had, over the lesser experienced greens member who had only been in politics for a year. The labour member has a proven record of protecting women‚Äôs rights and doing a lot for our community.
92. That makes no sense. If you are not voting LNP then you can't influence the LNP getting to 50%.
93. Exactly. I think it is more about the fact that the LNP preferenced Labor over the Greens. In those districts where it was a battle between the Greens and LNP I bet it made a difference. And you are right on housing. The Labor policy will help a handful of "lottery winners" while driving up housing prices for everyone else. They are building supply, but at a rate that it will be a generation or two abandoned on the smouldering ruins of fair housing before this is even potentially fixed.
94. The Greens‚Äô rhetoric on the Israel‚ÄìGaza war was the reason I voted Labor. They berated Israel after the horror of Oct 7, and were constantly parroting vile pro-Hamas propaganda. Sickening behaviour ‚Äî will never vote for them again. Also, it‚Äôs spelled ‚Äòsegue‚Äô not ‚Äòsegway‚Äô.
95. While the housing policies are neither here nor there, the Greens have an optics issue. We are in the middle of a housing crisis - ‚Äúperfect is the enemy of good enough‚Äù kind of thing, so if you‚Äôre holding out for better options, you‚Äôre seen as obfuscating any immediate action. The second thing is that the Greens are seen as a radical party with extreme positions - supporting the CFMEU, even though anyone that has had anything vaguely anything g to do with them has know there were very dodgy elements to it. Polling also shows that 50% of Australians just want to stay out of the Middle East confrontation - having such a visible presence at rallies that quite frankly accomplish fuck all and just irritate people wanting to get to their jobs or homes isn‚Äôt a great image either (and fuck off with the bullshit about disrupting being the point of a protest - if I‚Äôm late getting my kid from kindy and getting a late fee on top of it, I‚Äôm blaming the idiots who stood in the road and blocked me, not penning a note to my MP). You can blame Murdoch media all you want, but if you‚Äôre going to give them such an easy target, you can only blame yourself. I‚Äôd love to support the idea of a party like the Greens, but they‚Äôve turned into a too extreme version of that vision that prioritises political grand standing other than working in cooperation with other parties to accomplish anything other than protesting, which has so far accomplished nothing.
