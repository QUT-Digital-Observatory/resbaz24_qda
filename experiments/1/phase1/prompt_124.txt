Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. People who vote for LNP because the ALP have been in too long need to be removed from the voter rolls for life. They'd be the sort of person who goes to a Michelin Star'd restaurant, claim everything on the menu is rubbish then proceed to eat dog shit off the footpath out front and give it a 5-star recommendation and the actual restaurant 1-star. I'm not surprised the LNP won. What surprises me though are some of the swing percentages to the LNP; talking 10-15% to the LNP. That is a lot of people who somehow think a party with basically nothing positive to offer this state are worth being in power over a party which as been busting it's arse (especially once Miles took over) to make significant improvements for everyone. Every time the LNP has been in power that I can remember, it's been 4 years or complete chaos. They promptly get voted out again and it takes the ALP et al at least another 8 years to fix things back to pre-LNP state, never mind actually getting stuff done they would've if they retained power in the first place.
2. You said it yourself. The Palaszczuk era did nobody any favours. The straw that broke the camel’s back for me was the behaviour of Yvette D’ath as former health minister. I watched her push back against a Royal Commission into the handling of DNA (with respect to crime scene investigation) until it was absolutely unavoidable. When you get that level of incompetence, recklessness and arrogance - it’s time to change the government. Governments are like underwear - they need to be changed regularly otherwise they begin to stink - for much the same reason.
3. I voted lnp #2 overall independent labor and greens last. I will never ever vote labor they’re a bunch of leftie cunts voting green is a luxury I can’t afford the independent will never get enough votes and the liberals are a lesser version of labor. In my mind there’s no hope with them, we’ve tried their way and it’s gotten us no where… I’d rather give someone else a go.
4. Your not gonna find the answers your looking for on reddit
5. Probably more a question for Facebook or Twitter. The vast majority on reddit saw the good work that Miles was doing and were prepared to give him a go
6. Tell your mum, she might care more.
7. This is it exactly, I didn't even vote LNP but I can understand why so many did. What Miles was doing seemed like a good start but we had a decade of Labor before under Palaszczuk where despite solid leadership during COVID, major issues in the regions were either ignored or not adequately addressed. Even now that ALP have lost the election over it people here still refuse to acknowledge there might be a good reason for our decision other than "we just felt like it." By the time this election came around the regions were already fed up with the lack of action, the attitude from the ALP supporters just alienated people and added fuel to the fire leading up to election day (in particular the behaviour from people in this sub over the election weekend has been absolutely disgusting) and this is the result. There's a much longer, more detailed comment I'd like to post when I have more time but frankly I'm not sure it's worth the effort unless people are willing to have a civil discussion about it.
8. I will admit, youth crime in Queensland does seem like a proper issue compared to other states like mine. I actually researched youth crime for my research project this year, and one of the sources I used was a 7.30 report on [QLD's youth crime.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-28/qld-youth-crime-stateline-repeat-offenders-election/103512538) The "vibes" from this article and subsequent 7.30 story was that the youth justice system needed to be reformed from a punitive system to a restorative system, something that, unfortunately, it seemed that Miles and his party weren't willing to offer at the time. Now looking back, I don't blame Crisafulli for trying to step up and tackle this issue, but he's got it all wrong. Just from his slogan alone, he wants to punish this kids even further, which I've already said in the post that this'll only lead to more crime. Yaaaay!! Also it's good to see that WA is doing something cool. I have rather mixed opinions on them, stemming from a) being so far away and b) having a friend from WA do nothing but badmouth McGowan when talking about her state's politics. But yeah, school lunches are great. As long as they've got good options. Wouldn't mind having a government-bought apple in my lunch every day and no meat pie slop.
9. This election more than ever, we have seen the rot that social.media is causing. No one can engage in a discussion, it's either my opinion or you're an idiot. There is no middle ground, understanding or agree to disagree, just batles lines drawn and start throwing spears. Division and separation is winning and it is scary to watch. Where is the calm and grace from losing/winnings parties and supporters? Why can't people just move on like they used to?
10. I like this take, very evaluative of what has come before us in terms of COVID. I know we would like to ignore the events of COVID, but sentiments do fester. It either brought out the worst traits or the best traits out of whoever was in charge. "SHUT THE BORDER!!" comes to mind.
11. Thanks, this was very insightful. I actually had a conversation with my mum and she was like "It's the demographics". \*sigh\* I'm not old, so I don't know why elderly people vote the way they do, and that makes me feel a bit defeated. Perhaps it's the NIMBY mentality. Hate the NIMBY mentality. Gets no one nowhere. Also Fuck Murdoch. I'd spam that a gazillion times but I'm sane enough to only do it once.
12. Oh, but there's a "plan".
13. If Crisafulli bans abortion, I might take a long hard look at the country. Why would a country completely reverse its decision on abortion because of the obvious anti-abortion rhetoric coming in from the States? Oh wait, I remember. "I love a plundered country, a land of corporate gains". We've already succumbed to soft Imperialism, and it seems that we're willing to succumb to it again, even if it's in its weakest form. The USA is the drink, and we are the cup...ah shit that's a meme, sorry lol
14. I'm sorry, but "leftie cunts"? What did the left ever do to you??
15. I don't have facebook or twitter, both are hellscapes.
16. I don't have facebook or twitter, both are hellscapes.
17. Not helpful
18. Alot of this...Palaszczuk didn't do much looking back at her history as premier (I literally just looked it up as I couldn't remember anything but also wanted to make sure)...in his year it felt like miles did more for the people as a whole than Palaszczuk did...
19. The Katters have actually been pushing relocation sentencing for 7 years now and the LNP is actually just taking that as their idea. The adult time adult crime shit is for edge cases like murder and the like and makes a great slogan. Like these statistics are insane: > The Government's youth crime prevention measures are manifestly inadequate and are failing. Shockingly in 2021, 76% of young offenders across Queensland were charged with another offence within a year, 95% of detainees released from the Cleveland Youth Detention Centre in Townsville reoffended within a year and 100% of juvenile offenders on strict bail orders in Toowoomba reoffended within a year. https://kap.org.au/project/relocation-sentencing/ They've done their research and even written a white paper over trialling it.
20. Hear hear
21. Agreed. It's really disturbing to see how far the brain rot and the US style of fomenting hysteria is taking over. We used to be able to have sensible discussions about these issues and win or lose with grace. Now a group doesn't get their way so they want to spew vitriol and propose crazy ideas like banning everyone from future elections who doesn't think like them? We need to do better, on all sides.
22. >inciteful Insightful? Hard to tell as I am somewhat incited by the current state of QLD politics.
23. "Plan"... he wants to do what with a dog?!
24. If abortion actually gets banned we are going to look at moving overseas, I don't want to live in Little US
25. Left me and my future kids 200billion in debt, increased power bills by 100% or more, introduced new taxes, allowed big companies to get bigger and scam us with no real recourse. I could really go on.
26. Fuck over farmers and mum and dad businesses, while protecting large corporations with bail outs. Few years ago saw them battling whether to tax the lower tax bracket more or the highest one less😂🤷‍♂️ and Steven miles the grub don’t get me started I hope he rots.
27. Yeesh those statistics are rough. But this feels like watered down Campbell Newman policy. Am I wrong for thinking this? Obviously crime is a big problem, but I don't really subscribe to an idea that seems straight out of "*Holes*".
28. \*psst\* If it ever gets banned in QLD, come to SA. Our beaches don't want to kill you, and our government doesn't want to ban your wishes to terminate a pregnancy.
29. And.. where are you getting this information from? Because this actually sounds like policies that the LNP would introduce, especially "allowing big companies to get bigger and scam us".
30. Good to see you have no idea how anything works
31. The state's gross debt is $132b and net debt is $24b (which is a much better indicator because it accounts for our financial assets - NSW has a net debt of $104b and VIC has a net debt of $163b), but that's all pretty meaningless since investment in infrastructure is how we benefit society and create economic return.
32. The state government has nothing to do with income tax or tax brackets, and the federal government was the Liberal Party a few years ago.
33. Did Newman advocate for something similar?
34. With all due respect, Australia is already remote enough as it is, and having grown up in Europe and my partner being from Canada, I don't want to remove myself or our children further from our extended families.
35. It’s not whether I have an idea or not, it’s what I see them say and do on all my sources of media, sure we have an excess of royalties but under labor’s rule they’ll shut down all coal all uranium more then likely anything that creates pollution and destroys nature(except they’re extensive solar and wind farms in some of the most beautiful and remote places in Australia) I look at my power bill and it’s increased over 100% what the fuck do you want me to say? New sun tax after they spent billions pushing for solar, they’re cutting exports on meat and putting up red tape for agriculture industry’s, bailing out companies left right and centre while leaving everyday Aussies to rot, my dad got scammed 50grand while licensed insured all the rest as a plasterer and went bankrupt lost everything, same with my uncle. You stay brainwashed because while you think you know it all reality is you know shit all.
36. I hope you don't mind me citing wikipedia, but apparently "In September 2013, Newman announced that bootcamps for convicted young people will open in Townsville and Rockhampton by September 2013, along with two other camps. These bootcamps closed in 2015 under the Labor government."
37. Ah yeah, fair enough. It was worth a shot. Although I heard that the Canadian Conservatives might ban abortion too, but idk if that information is helpful. Gosh we live in scary times. I hope you guys stay safe. <3
38. Queensland has cheaper electricity than NSW (and Queenslanders received the biggest rebates in Australia). However, all states are within a few cents per kW/h. Definitely not "over 100%". The renewables you're against are part of a plan to diversify our grid, provide energy security, and lower prices for the next century. However, a crucial part of that will be scrapped now, and we'll likely be reliant on our existing coal generators for at least 10 years which is largely why prices are what they are.
39. Ah, I see, reading an abc article on it, they funnelled the money into their mates lol. Typical LNP.
40. Not sure if we would move to Canada or not. For your understanding I've been here for around 25 years so I don't WANT to leave, but I have no interest in paying taxes to a government that doesn't put the best interests of people first One of the worst parts of Australian politics is the compulsory voting, it means that scaremongering actually can win votes from people who otherwise should not or would not vote.
41. I’m telling you it went up over 100% I was paying 800 now 1655 not to mention I’m paying monthly now because they figured if we’re gonna fuck them in the ass we better make sure they can pay it, the way forward isn’t solar and wind you mort, the money it would take to only end up being able to support some of our nation is retarded… coal natural gas, nuclear. That’s the clear path forward but the current government despite seeing the whole world develop around them has chosen a path that doesn’t work, cost more in the long run and in the end we don’t have cheap reliable power? How clueless can one be.
42. Solar and wind are to be replaced within 25 years max, that doesn’t account for hail and other damage, we’ve spent nearly 2 billion on both so far probably more, with plans to spend 30 billion or more. So expect so see that cost atleast twice in an average Aussies life if not 3 times. 🤔🤔🤔🤔 for somthing that won’t even lower prices, won’t cater to demand and will have major consequences for the Australian people.
43. I believe in diversity, I’m not against solar or wind but they can only have so big a role, nuclear, renewable gas, coal/hydro wind/solar the perfect storm of power…. I also think we should work away from fossil fuels in the long run but not without proper energy infrastructure.
44. Typical LNP.
45. Fair, but I might have to disagree with you on the compulsory voting. My knowledge of voting systems is limited, but here's what I know: UK - FPP, shit. USA - aligns with their whole freedom thing with the choice of voting or not voting, but easily gives way to voter apathy. If the election feels like voting between the lesser of two evils, people can easily opt out of voting, which might allow the unpreffered candidate to gain leadership. AUS - Yes there might be the same chance of voter apathy as the US model, and yes, there may be a higher possibility of having hung parliaments, but in my opinion, it's the best option we've got. Gives the government a better spread of scores or whatever statistics language I'm supposed to use here.
46. Can attest to this, worked at a big place like total tools, the government must have spent over $30k for stuff that was never even taken out of the box, wonder what happened to it as.
47. And they wonder why this sub is a bit angry at the “it felt like we needed a change” and “both parties are the same” crowd.
48. Except that it doesn't, you have votes from people that don't want to vote, and just pick anything that they see. That's why there are party reps at the centres, hoping to gain last minute votes. That means that someone gets a vote based on a pamphlet, so they can get elected even tho the people voting for them will be worse off for it since the advertising rules are completely different when it comes to political advertising
49. I mean, I have reason to be fearful, my wife's a public servant, there is a real chance she loses her job, working in a highly competitive field and an unstable one at that, it might be very difficult for her to actually find stable work, and if that happens there's a good chance we lose our house because my field of work does not pay enough to afford our mortgage. It's all well, and good to tell people to relax when your livelihood isn't on the line, waiting for some cunt to decide to scrap entire government departments because the government can no longer afford it after they binned the tax on mining corps because their billionaire donors needed a new yacht.
50. the last time we trusted these guys, they abused it I think we have a right to be sceptical
51. When Newman did his cuts, within 3 months, I lost 5 youth clients due to the lack of youth liaison mental health services. When Newman decided it was more important to build a phallic tunnel that only cut 5 minutes of transmute, then funding into mental health services for outside of the great SEQLD money pit, I went from having about 200 other trauma psychologists to help deal with certain aspects of the worsened mental health issues, to only 48 others. These two events were interestingly tied to the trickle-down failure of youth, who once got help but now turned to crime. I am hoping this week that the sudden changes in my clients' appointments are not related to the situation of the LNP policing uterus owners' bodies. Because if they do criminalise abortions.... I fear the results of their stupidity because in America, some states have shown an increase in violence on pregnant persons, especially the violence that has led to the death of those pregnant persons.
52. You sound like the kind of person who says "both parties are the same". There are absolutely going to be changes. The reef will see more runoff, your power bills will increase and mining companies will be taxed less. You will see less money for your resources. There are risks to abortion and LGBTIQ+ rights. Children not yet found guilty of crimes will be sent to detention camps. The concept of "Innocent before proven guilty" will be gone for youth offenders.
53. I’m nervous about a few things with a big one being how the massive hole in the state budget is going to be filled after the LNP kill the coal royalties. $4-6billion per year across the forwards isn’t a small amount.
54. I can’t. I have a mortgage and a child and I need my job.
55. You have to understand that it this election makes Queensland seem *not quite as safe as it once was* Abortion once it came up in this context should have been a death knoll for the LNP but no. Instead we saw the opposite in my area, although it’s been LNP to its detriment for years had a huge swing to LNP. Honestly, it seems like guys saw an opportunity to grab some control over women and took it. And you can’t say “it’s not the states” because in the states they never thought Roe v Wade would get overturned. And it did. And women are dying. And rape victims are being forced to have children and share custody with their rapists. And schools are demanding access to girls menstrual tracking apps, women are being criminally prosecuted for miscarriages. Now you’ve got people calling for women to lose their voting rights. Relax? Don’t be hysterical? These are all thing people say right before they fuck you over. The fact that Queenslanders saw the potential for women to be stripped of reproductive rights and collectively decided that was ok is disturbing and shows how much of America’s bullshit has seeped into our culture. This election in a way was symbolic and proved plenty are willing to throw women under the bus without second thought
56. Despite being a labor supporter Im not the slightest bit surprised by the result. Governments do get tired/stale and as OP rightly says Aus politics is very moderate.....but....my issue over the 35+ yrs of adulthood is Conservative parties tend to do very little for society. Yes they do occasionally stuff things as per Newmann but from my experience they dont tend to do much to improve things. The LNP has a huge mountain to climb in Qld and I hope they do try and improve things and dont just play it safe to try and stay in Gov.
57. Queensland has no upper house. I won't take a breath when they have the ability to carry out their election promises so rapidly. Also, fuck you and your condescension.
58. Do you not remember the last time these exact guys were in charge during the Newman years? It was disastrous for Queensland and so many Queenslanders. And they ABSOLUTELY will be stripping women of their rights as they ban abortion again.
59. People think because they personally will probably survive comfortably everyone will, no, not everyone survives
60. The US wasn’t always where it is today either…
61. Things don’t just go bad overnight. Neumann came into power about 3 years after the 2008 financial crash. I don’t recall the state of the economy but I’m guessing that the ALP got blamed for the poor state of the economy. Remember the crash was triggered in the USA and the ripple effect went throughout the world. It was caused by the big business side of politics, yet it was the ordinary workers that got hit the most. The Central banks of the most affected countries just ‘printed’ more money to pay for programs that were put in place to try and secure the economies. The wealthy became wealthier, the poor became poorer. Neumann managed to screw up big time and was kicked out about 10 years ago. I’m not an economist, but I wonder how long it took to repair the damage caused by his policies. It would have been about 6 years later that COVID hit the world. Again the banks printed money, the rich got richer and the poor got poorer. The ALP steered us through that quite well considering. However people soon forget. Yes the housing crisis has got worse, yes the hospital waiting lists are a bit longer, the juvenile crime wave in regional centres have increased/ decreased ? (depending on who you believe). Cost of living has gone up for everyone. How much of the problem was caused by bad management or bad luck we’ll probably never know. Though not everyone has been hit the same. The poor have got poorer and the rich are still rich or even richer. Big business became worried that their profit margins are not going to be as high as they would like so they start clamouring for a change. Time for a change, ‘It’s Time’, becomes the catchcry. Ok, we’ve got our change. I hope we don’t regret it. Remember Qld is the only State without a house of review. There’s no one to prevent the Government going rogue. No one except the Governor that is. There is a precedent for the dismissal of a legitimate government (Gough Whitlam by Kerr). I think we’re in for an interesting few years. I hope Crisafulli has the strength of character to keep his word and do what’s right. I hope the ALP have the stamina and intellectual acuity to fulfill their new role by supporting the government, when the legislation benefits the needy as well as those who are better off. And hold them to task, when they forget that they are our servants who have been delegated power to benefit the people. I’d hate to see one side attacking the other just because they can. Not everyone has a short memory.
62. > Nobody is going to strip you of your fundamental rights as a human. Unless you are a child https://www.unicef.org/child-rights-convention/convention-text-childrens-version (check number 37) Or a woman.
63. Spoken like someone who doesn't have a uterus.
64. They literally removed rights for LGBTIQ+ people last time they got in (and this wasn’t a platform they took to that election either), so spare us the gaslighting. https://www.crikey.com.au/2012/06/26/newman-v-gays-where-else-but-queensland/
65. Have you heard of Campbell Newman?
66. Something tells me your rights aren't on the line.. I also see you refer to yourself as a swing voter, but so far 100% of people I come across who say they're centrists/undecided/swing voters all end up on the right.. so let's see what your profile contains.. Casual racism, several pronoun jokes.. that's real classy.. and uhh, what the fuck is this? [https://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerkaustralia/comments/1fkhsxy/comment/lnvuea3/](https://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerkaustralia/comments/1fkhsxy/comment/lnvuea3/)
67. It does not matter if we are not the states if all the same tricks work…
68. OP needs a history lesson https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joh_Bjelke-Petersen
69. Searching kids at school? Then, they don't get lunches. Treating every kid like a criminal because you can't provide the services needed to support them and help change grow. What exactly is considered an Adult Crime? Wtf is that? They're desperate, their brains aren't developed, they're a product of poverty... whatever the reason, you can't charge a child as an adult. What IS an "adult crime"??? They're just crimes. They shoul be charged as is appropriate to the offenders circumstances and cognitive ability. Kids don't have adult cognition. Our 18 Year old adults don't even have adult cognition until they're 25. The idea is to take that knowledge of delayed cognition, and harness it for behaviour change. Most 'criminals' aren't inherently bad. They're just mixed up in the wrong stuff. Happens a lot. Not dissimilar to people getting done by scams. When people are under pressure they do weird things. You can't say that chuck them in jail for their life is productive to anyone. You create more anger.
70. Aside from the bodily autonomy issue, which is very important, it's the approach to renewables that concerns me the most. Failure to progress with the planned pumped hydro projects will be to the detriment of all Queenslanders, and set our journey back a decade or more.
