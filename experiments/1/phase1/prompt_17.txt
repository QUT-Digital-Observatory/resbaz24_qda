Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Hah, so has the branches of labor. The greens had zero influence on the decision, its just nice they claim to agree. The labor government does not care about what the greens want *more* than their own branch parties. They dont pull this kind of policy from nowhere. I can absolutely deny that the greens had any part in it because they simply didn't. So you sorta understand how the process work in qld only, branches agree on and propose policy to the next level of qld state gov for them to consider, more brances asking for the same policy means its more likely to be actioned by the government, branches communicate with one another to bring up the same policys so they gain more traction, its one of the most democractic process in the country. I can guarantee you they were talking about cheaper/free transport 2 years ago in the branches. The greens just say it to make their voters feel good, given the greens track record, they would have delayed it if they could.
2. Greens never clearly outlined how they would fund free/50cent fares. Also Greens want to end mining so they couldn’t propose using mining royalties to fund policies if they want to end the source of said revenue. Bit of a tricky point whereas ALP can do such funding arrangements.
3. That doesn't mean they had any influence. Many political parties align on some things that doesnt magically mean the party who mentioned it that one time had any sway in its implementation by another party.
4. Nothing. Got it.
5. yeah, i know, its a sad basis for a council where they see their job to maintain a museum of dilapidated queenslanders.
6. I expect a lot from the LNP, all of it negative sadly.
7. Yeah actually, the way Qld parliament works without an upper house means legislation can be changed overnight by a majority gov. So they can change it overnight on a wim if it's a sitting day. Katter's bring the bill - gov votes and passes it. Nothing more needed. Newman rammed stuff through late night on a few occasions iirc
8. When did I say I did? The newly elected government has said they're not going to build a new stadium for the olympics, but is open to building a new stadium at the Gabba. I know they have likely lied and/or made promises they can't keep. Knowing exactly what a party has promised is important when holding them to account. So if they cut 50 cents fares after a term, that is a broken promise.
9. >any bets a month ago would have said that they were at serious risk of being reduced to a cricket team. I really thought people would wake up and stick with S.Miles I was hoping for a minimum spend on Olympics and minimum lasting impact on the city from the Olympics. DC is going to make a bad situation much worse. I still believe refurbishing an older stadium is better that letting it rot while the DC government gives away Victoria Park to developers to build his Cristafully Stadium and sports entertainment precinct. He really should STOP and realise that he will not be the premier when the Olympics happens, so why waste public money and give away public land to developers just so some other politicians can be there for the shameful glory if it.
10. All parties committed to keeping it. The question is whether they keep their promises.
11. Idk why, but ferries have seen the greatest increase.
12. It used to be $10 for myer centre on weekends. If you found a park on the street in the evenings, it is usually less than $10 for a couple of hours or free (after 7 pm in some spots). Two people on the bus from West End was around $15.
13. $10ish
14. NORTH LAKES DOESN'T HAVE A TRAIN STATION?! the actual fuck?! No wonder the North Lakes on ramp onto the Bruce is such a nightmare. What idiot approved all those developments without putting in a train line
15. Ride a bicycle to the nearest station
16. Not sure why you're getting downvoted here, as you're correct. Making the fares cheap doesn't actually increase demand by much, however it is definitely a good cost of living relief measure. Frequency and a good overall network is what drives good patronage. Having all of the above would be wonderful!
17. The tactic of blaming the previous party. In my opinion, work more so on people who consume mainstream media. Those people, in my opinion, are of the older generations. I have found through my own efforts that the younger generation doesn't partake and has a more open approach in some circumstances. Do you agree? Thought I'd reword it to make more sense. Sorry if I confused you
18. Yes. Over 40's are the most gullible and easily manipulated people on the planet. Brains like putty.
19. From the Queensland Audit Office: *In 2022–23, net debt (financial liabilities minus financial assets) decreased, as it did last year. Favourable economic conditions, particularly higher revenue from the royalties that companies pay for mining coal, meant the government borrowed less than it budgeted for in 2022–23.* *The government has budgeted $96 billion for capital expenditure over the next 4 years to deliver a variety of infrastructure in energy, transport, health, education, and water management. So, as revenue from royalties reduces and debt is used for significant government initiatives, net debt is expected to increase.* Eta whoops this was meant for the comment you're replying to
20. The whole COVID-19 debt thing is bit of a misnomer; whilst initially revenue streams dried up by 2020-2021 they were exceeding pre-pandemic figures (from memory GST revenue went from $62B to $75B). Overall government operating costs dropped (or shifted), federal government funding increased, GST revenue increased as well as did revenue streams from the housing and building sectors. We also saw increases in the costs of registration, fines and other government services. Now whilst a surplus is great it has all come on the back of those mining royalties; if those mining companies leave (because they can and have) that revenue stream will dry up mighty quick. Something about killing the goose that laid the golden egg. At the end of the day we are in $132B of debt so a surplus of a few hundred million isn't exactly a windfall.
21. I’m so over people not understanding general economics. We have one of the highest credit ratings you can get. Our state economy has been handled just about perfectly
22. Really, we can't cover spending? Strange we wound up with a surplus 3 financial years running.
23. And will cost more than if they just had actual staff. Like they did when they fired all the parliament house cleaning staff and hired in contract workers.
24. As opposed to union mates? Lets not pretend that both sides of politics are corrupt, just to different over lords
25. Was mine before I moved. Dude booked out an entire shop front to hang his signs on the front door, right next to a pre poll booth. And if you tried to hand out how to vote cards to people whom naturally followed the footpath in front of it from the parking lot, he would throw a tantrum and threaten to film you.... Not sure the legality of that, but blokes pretty old to be acting like a darn toddler, especially given at the time, it was very clearly gonna be his win. And I was early 20s at the time. So this was quite a shocking surprise to have this manchild MP act that way. So, I would get right up to the edge of it in order to do so, and made the angry cunt seethe. Tip: If you dont want me to annoy you, dont be a cunt while setting a clear line I can push right up to before consequences. (Or in general, if you want to not be bullied by others, dont give them the ammo and tell them how to hurt you). That party bubbles up some of the worst human beings to prominence and positions of power, but then again if your smart enough to understand what the LNP do and still vote/work for them then your a malicious cunt. And if you dont understand anything, you're just a useful tool.
26. it's the only direction it works for really! saying I'm an eastie sounds dumb AF. northie and south don't really work either. westie privilege haha. I actually don't think it's a Brisbane term, it must be a Sydney one.
27. >The Labor government does not care about what the greens want more than their own branch parties. I think they very much cared that they saw their primary preference votes going that way and adopted policies to match the Greens. Without the Greens, the votes wouldn't have gone that way and there wouldn't have been a push (or certainly not as strong) towards those goals. You're fairly naive if you don't see the direct connection.
28. >Also Greens want to end mining Huh, you should probably tell the [QLD Greens](https://greens.org.au/qld/public-mining) that then... because one of their election campaign promises this time around was to *create their own mining company* (and **raise royalties**.) >Queensland Minerals will be a government owned corporation paying 100% of its profits to the people of Queensland. Also; >with an initial investment of $4 billion from the Queensland Treasury, funded by the Greens’ plan to **raise royalties on coal and gas.**
29. > Greens never clearly outlined how they would fund free/50cent fares. Same way you fund anything. > Also Greens want to end mining so the This is just dumb. Stop watching skynews.
30. >I really thought people would wake up and stick with S.Miles >I was hoping for a minimum spend on Olympics and minimum lasting impact on the city from the Olympics. I like your optimism on the first point, but the reality is that no government I can remember in Australia has ever pulled back a deficit like that. We'll have to agree to disagree on the second point.
31. committed verbal is different than on paper. on paper i only see the 6 month trial was stipulated.
32. People go for a cruise up and down the river maybe? It's nice.
33. It's currently $11 at the Myer centre on weekends
34. $15 for two from west end? It was a $1.60 one way from cannon Hill. I was paying $10 early bird parking in Myer centre and Southbznk had $120 monthly for 24/7 access which I used for a while
35. When was this?
36. Just you wait till you find out about flagstone and Ripley. They both have train stations planned. But we're going to cram 100,000 people in there first.
37. it technically does, about 1.5km away from the westfield is mango hill station, but it's an uphill walk either way and buses don't reliably service it without running the risk of missing the train. thankfully there is a major bus station about 200m walk away from the westfield across the road from the library which can get you as far as chermside without switching buses (and obviously from chermside you can get pretty much everywhere else)
38. Mango Hill does. My mum is in North Lakes, and it's a 5 min drive to that station.
39. There are two train stations in Mango Hill that you can drive to and there are buses that transfer to the Mango Hill station (not sure about Mango Hill East) but by and large the bus frequency is anaemic to the point where you feel it would be faster to walk. It's convenient if you're a uni student, USC in Petrie is a direct train link. For myself though, I work in Nudgee so driving from North Lakes to Mango Hill, taking a train to Northgate, then boarding an outbound train to Nudgee, then walking two kms to work isn't an attractive prospect vs a car, even when you factor in how bad the Gateway is.
40. Thanks. Thought i was having a stoke there 😆. I think anyone who consumes only mainstream media can be easily swayed. You have to put al little effort in to research the topics yourself, and take whatever the pollies say with a grain of salt.
41. Actually, over 60..... Some over 50.
42. Funny. I thought tik tok consumers were mainly under 40 years old.
43. you may want to refine that. Every age group and demographic can be manipulated, there's a reason churches and cults target late teens and early 20 year olds, because you think you know it all but don't know shit. That age bracket is the easiest of targets. People around 40 to around early 50's may be the most cynical and least effected on a whole. The last group to spend a childhood with out the internet, participation trophies and satellite parenting, still responsible for your own actions. On the other end, the first generation that grew up with rapid growth in technology. Thankfully, camera's didn't have phones attached at that point. GenX grew up on the back of boomers, so realised early on our opinions didn't mean much, as a voting block we are much smaller then the "Generation" before or after. Its pretty established that as you get older your views become much harder to change, for most. You stop learning and/or experiencing new things much more.
44. I'm not going to down vote you, but that generalisation is bullshit.
45. I tried to search for this and couldn't find anything easily, but which mining companies have left QLD because of the mining royalties?
46. The numbers don't lie. We may have had a budget surplus, i.e. they said they would spend x, and spent y, but as you can see, the state has not been paying down its debt. These are the Miles governments own numbers. You may not like it and believe that borrowing money to offset spending is a surplus, which is what they have told us, but the reality is the above and below. \*\*EDIT - all of the information is here to read.

47. goddamn what an asshole, good on you for doing that. makes me wanna move too lol knowing he’s my representative in state parliament
48. Without the greens huh? The party that just lost 2 seats and barely held the other? The party that blocked industrial relation bills, housing bills and development in their own electorates. My first labor meeting they brought up free transport this has been in the works far longer than the greens even know, Miles just cared more about it than his predecessor and implemented it. If the greens knew they were going to do it, they would have blocked it if they got the opportunity. Labor does not care what the greens think, they are far from a threat to them.
49. I don’t read/watch Sky News. And I don’t vote LNP. I’m just going based on what ABC has reported, that Greens want to end mining and transition to renewable energy. “In order to do so, the Greens believe Australia should completely transition out of fossil fuels, including coal, oil and natural gas and into renewable energy within the next eight years. The Greens acknowledge Australia relies heavily on fossil fuel exports to support the economy, and says it envisions kicking off a renewable export industry to replace it. ” Last paragraph says they want to replace it completely so it’s not Sky News. https://amp.abc.net.au/article/101088406
50. In front of dozens of cameras is a campaign promise.
51. Yep. I’ve done the cruise a few times in the last month with my daughter. We stop at every stop and play at the closest playground, then back on to the boat to the next stop. Great day out for a 7 year old.
52. Ok, I didn't know if it had changed or not. It was sometimes hard to find a park and all the staircases stunk of piss though. Plus we park our car on the street and so the whole drive is waiting for the air con to work haha. I much prefer the bus now, especially since the Vic bridge is closed to cars.
53. >It was a $1.60 one way from cannon Hill. Full fare? In what, 1999?
54. I'm talking about two years ago. 2x adult fairs return was around $15 from memory. It varies if you go off peak etc
55. Kid was still in a pram so have to be 5-6 years ago.
56. I've been pissed about Ripley for a while, legislation needs changing. Developers stage releases like they do to avoid footing the bill for infrastructure works as basic as dual lane roads. Ripley being a current example, and Springfield being one before that.
57. There's no frequent shuttle bus service to and from the trains around North Lakes and quite often the bus arrives after the train leaves. At peak hour there should be enough buses to service connection with the train service IMO as the reliability would increase overall public transit usage
58. Anyone that doesn't know how to critically think.
59. Thats my bad. I had a workplace accident and sometimes forget how to write. Comes out all fucky sometimes
60. I'm not sure what the statement on borrowings means in that image, can you explain it?
61. Going from naive to wilfully ignorant then
62. A party that still managed to get 10% of primary votes that use to go directly to Labor, yes. It's also why LNP has gone a little right to chase the ~8% the racists over at PHON and ~2.5% that Homophobic and misogynistic KAP parties get.
63. Nothing in there talks about mining. It talks about reliance on fossil fuels for QLD electricity generation. It also talks about future goals. Envisions being a key word there, thats not stopping mining, its supporting other industries so that in the future Coal/Gas/Oil mining is redundant and stops itself.
64. But we all know, a promise is never a guarantee with any politician persuasion. remember the following statements... "there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead - Julia Gillard"...... " There will be no child living in poverty - Bob Hawk"...... and more recently its been proven by senate inquiry ... '(amec) **The national energy regulator says it cannot guarantee the Albanese government's renewable energy plan will lower prices**. Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) chief executive Daniel Westerman made the admission while fronting a senate inquiry on LAST Wednesday". And that's after Labor telling everyone for years Green energy will guarantee cheaper consumer electricity prices. and also AEMO stated they never even factored the cost of upgrading the gird etc. i HOPE FOR qld it stays, but if it doesn't it still wouldn't surprise me not because Liberal got in, but because there was never any guarantee Labor would have kept it running once the trial has finished. At the end of the day funding will be the determinating factor.
65. Yep about that timeframe exactly lol paper tickets punched by driver and all.
66. $15 fro. West end. It's just across the bridge. Bloody rort!
67. They said completely transition out of? What does that mean? We currently get a lot of royalties from coal mining and Greens want to completely transition out of mining, I mean it’s right there written in plain English. That’s what I was saying is we get a lot of mining royalties from coal and if they end it, we won’t get such royalties to pay for other things. It would have to come down to other taxation revenue.
68. I never said guarantee either. Promises and commitments in electoral cycles are the same thing. As the party in opposition, they can't guarantee anything until they're elected. AEMO is raising prices despite Labor efforts in Qld, because other states aren't making the same transformation as they're businesses not government entities. So the price goes up because other governments sold their infrastructure to the private sector. Labor in Qld has lowered prices overall, by rebates because they can't control the warehousing price.
69. It was the minimum fare. Yeah 50c fares are great.
70. I see you completely ignored my other comment that links to the current Greens policy about creating a mining company and increasing royalties on mining which utterly disproves your very incorrect interpretation of the "plain English" there. So I'll stop here. Have a good day.
71. You initially said "end mining" which was correctly pointed out as wrong and foolish. Now you've posted a statement about transitioning out of fossil fuels, which in no way means the end of mining. Put down the goalposts sir.

73. Unless they incorporate shopping to replace the old centre, which nundah is struggling without, and include a couple residential towers, I don't see it happening.
74. Can't see it, the flooding is too significant there for that kind of infrastructure.
75. Gets regularly irrigated every summer, will save thousands on annual water bills /s
76. Simply won’t happen due to the height restrictions in place there due to the airport.
77. Cool but how about we sort out some commercial space to replace Toombul first? The Woolworths carpark is a shit show, traffic backs up so far on Buckland and Melton Road with several accidents on Melton Road a year. We desperately need another grocery store, since we’ve lost a Coles, Aldi, produce shop and butcher. Not only that but we don’t have a Kmart, and we lost several other services like doctors and bank branches. Nundah Village can’t adequately maintain the growing density of the area. Fuck off with a stadium, it doesn’t help us at all. Ask literally any Nundah resident what they want done with Toombul and they’ll say to bring back some of the shops.
78. Where did you see/ hear this rumour? From an actual source or just some neighbour who thinks it’s a good idea
79. London, Paris, Rio … Toombul
80. Nah. Not gonna happen. The land is in the hands of private developers and is valuable. It would be a decent idea though. Good access. Good location for it, requires expensive flood mitigation but doable.
81. They can flood it like the coliseum for rowing
82. You *might* be able to protect the stadium but the introduction of something so massive would change water flows so significantly that it would create a huge issue for all other properties
83. Olympic Swimming Pool would be a great choice. The treated water can be released to nearby creek. Games can continue in the event of flood.
84. Better hope it doesn’t rain during the olympics 💀
85. The torrent of water that flows down the kedron brook might disagree with this idea.
86. Would have to pry it out of Mirvacs cold dead hands. Probably be closer to Newstead and Gasworks scale.
87. An immediate family member of mine is the head accounting person for the Olympics, incl. infrastructure. I'm gonna msg them now & suss it out..
88. Looking forward to the panic when it floods 6 months before the games.
89. Long thought it was the ideal location. Flood proofing it would be trivial by raising the floor plate height to the same as toombul station. Pedestrian flyover to the station. Redevelop kedron brook into nice parkland. Make it an entire sporting complex from mercer Park to the norths devils leagues club. You could make an amazing mixed use entertainment district all through there. Airport link, rail to airport, rail to the city, east west arterial to the gateway. Giving amazing transport links. Brisbane needs to stop trying to stick everything in the center. Create a separate area people want to go to.
90. I’m sure the locals would love the extra noise, lights and traffic. It would really boost the area
91. I am not sure what being close to the Airport and Tunnel has to do with it being a good place for a venue. The most common arrival at stadiums is by bus, train and walking. The Gabba is the superior option as we are just about to complete works on CRR which was built in part to facilitate great game day access
92. I love a good venue flood
93. That will go swimmingly
94. RemindMe! 6 months
95. The community needs a new shopping centre there, it shouldnt be anything else, there’s a massive and inconvenient black hole.
96. Random thought. How about the site of Albion Park Paceway? Lots of space taken up by the Paceway for a rather obscure sport. Surrounded by industrial units which few people would miss if they got redeveloped. They could redevelop the areas around the stadium to provide complementary uses, and restore that part of the creek. Build a pedestrian over the creek to a new train station adjacent to the train holding yards. In terms of synergy, it's next door to Allan Border Field. Given it's location next to the river, it'll show off Brisbane in a positive light.
97. Dear god I hope not
98. Excellent idea that will save money especially during the summer periods...... A natural swimming pool already exists during the annual flooding event.
99. Nundah and toombul couldn’t handle 10,000+
100. It also floods like crazy which is why the shopping centre was torn down. Anyone who considers building any expensive infrastructures here is a fool.
