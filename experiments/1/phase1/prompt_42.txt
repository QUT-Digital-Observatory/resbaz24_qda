Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. unfortunately they will do nothing its such a tough one while its only a tiny fragment of the population who are committing the serious crimes they are being set out on bail. understandably bail laws should be soft for the boy caught selling grams of weed at school or the girl who gets popped w a bag full of unpaid cosmetic stuff. but violence and serious theft such as house breaking, car theft, weapon possession ect fuck em I was a shit of a kid, I grew up alright but had a heap of issues. I fucking get it. I had a stable home , good suburb all of that and still was a teenage addict. kids def need compassion. but the real shits. like the violent ones. the ram raid ones. the home invasion ones. the ones w blades. fuck them.
2. Actually having a plan to address it wouldn't have done anything. Unfortunately a huge chunk of people don't want to see the issues solved, they want to see punishment, whether it works or not
3. ALP needed you
4. They did
5. This!
6. I agree with you, and I think a proactive and progressive approach is far better than something reactive like jailing kids. Unfortunately the people who have to deal with youth crime in places like Townsville don’t want to wait around, they just want the problem solved. Throwing a kid in jail does exactly that. The reality too is that a lot of these offenders have trauma or are victims of some kind of abuse, so they may go on to perpetuate the cycle in their own kids without any intervention or help. So any progressive solutions can take a very long time to be realised in society.
7. The ridiculous thing is, I live on the Fraser Coast and as of 2023 we were getting a major upgrade to our police station in addition to more personnel. Didn’t hear any of that from Labor or the media though.
8. crime going down statistics is weird set of cherry picking. The actual stats are all over the place and it hard to make a story up one way or the other. There is same physical number of youth committing crime (less per capita then 10 years ago) but they are committing more crime 3.9 vs 2.7 offences and on alot more unique victums. Crime rates in regionals towns have increased and not just the ones related to DV. I grew up in logan in the 90's I would say there was more crime than now, but the type of crimes and victums were different. They weren't as random, and alot less people carried knifes. I won't say the police aren't doing anything, all of last term police were at the major trains and bus stations in my area from 3-4. Wanding all non-uniform teens(still not sure how that legal) and they had quite a collection of knifes the first few times. After that the teens stop showing up.
9. Miles openly stated, "Abortion is health care"
10. Miles openly stated, "Abortion is health care"
11. > It’s certainly a problem and It’s a regular topic of discussion with the locals. It's a discussion in plenty of places, that doesn't mean it's an actual legitimate problem however, were you to read the average suburbs facebook group you'd think we live in a war torn hellhole, whereas in reality there's absolutely crime but it's not even remotely close to some epidemic and voting for those who plan to do the very thing that has always been shown to make crime worse is just fucking daft.
12. Not if you dont let it.. keep them honest..
13. You needed to look at more stories. Lots of the stuff from NQ was pretty shocking. I don’t care if it had just been one cop car stolen and taken for a joy ride (it was more), things have to be pretty bad already to become that lawless.
14. Not for the people in Nth Queensland. Stealing cars is really bad up there to the point where a family member put cameras up and has seen 3 kids trying to to get into the house while they are at work, during the day, this year. I think people in SEQ don’t realise how bad it is up there. Is LNP the answer, of course not but people up there haven’t seem any change and are looking for a quick fix, which I doubt they will get but it didn’t stop them voting against labour because of it.
15. As someone who is born and raised in Mount Isa and now lives in Brisbane, let me assure you of something. Youth crime is a rare and isolated thing in Brisbane. It is a regular near daily occurrence in Mount Isa. Do yourself a Favour and actually spend time talking to people living in the regions before you go dismissing there lived realities.
16. Thee was also the factor that Crisafulli turned victims of Youth Crime into his political props. Once he started bringing victims to tell their stories to his press conferences, the Labor Government couldn't regain control of the narrative, emotion had taken over. No amount of stat waving or Police Commissioners stating otherwise was going to shift the topic out the emotional perspective. It's not the victims families fault, what happened to them was a tragedy and I completely understand that they want justice for what was done to them. But, going on Prime time television with the opposition leader to attack a government which doesn't have control over people in the way voters think it does was just pure exploitation. It just shows how morally bankrupt the Queensland media landscape is when they continually allowed it to happen again and again. If you're from a southern state, expect this tactic to be used in your neck of the woods soon enough because honestly it's pretty effective.
17. You can quote whatever stats you want, but it doesn’t hit hard till it’s your house or in my case right next door.
18. The rise in the affordability of those doorbell cameras means the news always has footage to run with. That perpetuates the purchase of the cameras.
19. The media will always sensationalise heated topics, unfortunately. A good political team will know best how to address and navigate the issue. A good voter should do their due diligence and become more informed.
20. Albo & Swan definitely need to adapt their plans for next year. They need to make people forget Albo is PM, while having a new public face doing most of the campaigning imo.
21. Everyone hates Morrison, even Libs
22. I agree, but I also don't believe the LNP will fix anything anyone can say buzz words Adult Crime, Adult Time. Putting kids / youth into prison won't fix anything it, In fact jailing kids often makes them worse and serial offenders. But I guess we just have to see what happens.
23. Unfortunately, regional Qld has lots of young people doing dodgy crap, maybe it is recency bias, but it feels like there is more serious crime from young people with reports that they are out on bail or behaviour deals before more significant events. I think in the city it is easier to let the numbers be part of the very small crime crowd, but in small towns each incident has weight and significance to the broader community as everyone is a little more connected. I don't know the answer, but I don't think LNP is it. Just starting to see why this is weighing on a lot of communities in Qld in spite of all the other policy issues around
24. >Until there are true consequences imposed by judges, not a lot is going to change. Until there are consequences imposed ON judges ...... Police arrest them, Judges go easy on them.... the Premier tries to walk a middle ground between Judges interpretation of appropriate sentencing and Public and victim expectations.... but gets blamed.
25. It isn't a case of "waking up". The people who voted LNP because of this issue want "out of sight, out of mind". Locking kids up isn't a problem as long as it's not *their* kids, and the problem is invisible. Harm reduction or solving root causes isn't what they think they're getting from the LNP. "Just make it go away, don't care how as long as it doesn't affect me".
26. Oh it will have changed. It won't have gone *down* but it will have *changed*.
27. This is not to downplay regional crime issues but in this scenario of a grey nomad is it more or less; stereotypically boomers tend to have lived a fairly sheltered life, they then venture out expecting a romanticised version of aus, whilst grey nomading and get hit with reality of how people actually live out in communities? These are the same people that cross the street when they see a black fella and we’re supposed to absorb their fear? When they’ve come from mostly white towns they tend to have a culture shock. Just surmising and what not.
28. Show me region data that's says NQ is down. It's not for general crime rates, verifiable via the QPS statistics site, even though the media and reddit tried gaslighting me because 'statewide' it's down.
29. There are bright sides on Labor's campaign but it wasn't just enough. The greens campaign was a shitshow disaster on the other hand
30. But it’s not about just the campaign. This has been an issue for years. The ALP could have done something ages ago and neutralised the issue all together.
31. Unfortunately trauma informed care isn't as exciting to them as publicly whipping an 11 year old.
32. Absolutely, if folks actually cared about seeing the issue solved, they'd have voted for the Greens who actually had a set of policy that would address the issue properly - https://greens.org.au/qld/policies/youth-justice Trouble is that doesn't feel good to the average voter who just want to see others suffer because they've been conditioned to strip the humanity from anyone they don't like.
33. The thing is if things get stolen from you, yes, you want the offender get punished but the main thing is something got stolen, if the government gives a bit of assistance to financially recover from crime, they might be less out for blood and more open to those kind of approach
34. Also for those area once is enough for home invasions, you can't expect people to lie around have their home invaded constantly while waiting for the program to take hold, there has to be a system to separate the repeat offenders away
35. Wanding powers come from "Jack's Law", which was introduced in 2023 after a fatal stabbing of a 17 years old. It warrants police to use metal detector wands on all public transport, including stations, and any area declared a "safe night" precinct. In August it was expanded to also include shopping centers, licensed premises, retail outlets and public events. The law was in response to the stabbing death of Jack Beasley at Surfers in 2019.
36. Crime is increasing as population is increasing faster, so that's technically crime going down (youth crime anyway), the only argument I didn't have the answers to was what are the actual crimes and at what point at the crimes added to the stats. Cause crime can go down, but if the crimes are worse then it's not really going down is it. So just hard to get all the correct info.
37. As did Crusifelli, your point? Edit: Obviously C--- is full of shit about it. I'm just pointing out to LNP fans criticising Miles that their own leader said this too.
38. They never were
39. The police beat in Mount Isa was burned down many years ago and to this day they operate out of a donga. There has been more then once instance of a cop car being stolen and taken on a joyride. Its entertaining to say the least.
40. We always hear about how close knit and supportive these communities are. So what’s going wrong in the communities themselves? Why aren’t they stepping in, why are kids going off the rails and where are the parents?
41. I’m not sure I’d call Russell Field a prop. He was obviously so affected by losing his son, his son’s partner and his unborn grandchild when they were hit by an 17 year old who was drunk, high and in a stolen vehicle, he’s decided to do something about it.
42. Yeah of course for people directly impacted it’s going to seem like it’s everywhere (because it happened to you!). That doesn’t mean that it actually is everywhere, it’s literally the definition of anecdotal. If we do want to lower youth crime, we know from studies and other countries that harsher sentences doesn’t work. A 13 year old about to steal a car isn’t going to stop because they are going to get 2 years in jail instead of 6 months - there brains aren’t developed enough to comprehend the consequences. Things that do work are early intervention and school lunches, but the LNP platform isn’t going to make the situation better - if anything will likely exacerbate the situation.
43. The facts Big Doorbell doesn't want you to know.
44. Half the population is below average intelligence. Everyone is overworked and stressed with the cost of living crisis. It’s the media’s job to report the truth and framed in a way to help people understand the truth. It’s not the media’s job to create fear in the community. Is youth crime in Queensland at a record low? Yes. Are there pockets of regional Queensland that has high youth crime? Yes. Will harsher sentencing have any tangible effect? No. Will early intervention and more community support help? Yes. What solutions are the major parties proposing and do experts agree?
45. Locking ppl up isn’t a complete fix but it’s a deterrence just like police alcohol testing or speed cameras. If there are no consequences imagine how bad the roads would get. It’s ridiculous to think harsher penalty would have no effect on youth crime (or any crime really).
46. Pretty much, at work theres an exective who went to NT in june, where a bunch of kids came up to the car asking for booze and cigaretts. He's brought it up everyday since he got back
47. [deleted]
48. I heard they’d dine their dough on trying to get Jonathan Sriranganathan in as Lord Mayor.
49. Did the greens even have a campaign lol ![gif](giphy|x9cDy0c3bOxxwDZmJm)
50. The outgoing police commissioner even said it was an issue and the new commissioner had a task force on it. Yet the ALP tried to run on a campaign of, “even though you’re telling us it’s a concern to you, you’re wrong and it’s not a problem.” Overall crime is down. Youths stealing cars in regional towns is up and a a genuine problem we need to solve.
51. Any idea why they didn’t? They had the facts instead of focusing on TikTok
52. Paragraph 11 He does support a woman’s right to choose. You were correct. https://amp.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/22/queensland-election-2024-lnp-abortion-policy-david-crisafulli
53. Its obviously a very complicated problem, and there's no singular cause or solution. Oftentimes the parents of these kids are absentee. Alot of them don't work, are on the dole and have substance abuse issues (alcoholics, mostly) and simply do not care where their kids are or what they are doing. Once when I was a teenager, I had a house party where a 14 year old kid stole hundreds of dollars out of my fathers wallet from his bed side table while he was sleeping. When we confronted the mother about this she told me the issue was between us and her son, she had nothing to do with it and she also had no idea where he currently was. Thats the reality for a lot of kids out that way. As for the community. What exactly is the community supposed to do? These kids are untouchable. One guy detained a child who broke into his home for the police to apprehend. Instead he was apprehended for illegally detaining a child (kidnapping essentially). My friends a high school teacher and she can not physically touch a student, even if that student is physically assaulting another student (which happens regularly). The biggest issue people out this way want addressed is the magistrates. The police do a fantastic job and have a high presence. However, all they can do is arrest these kids, put them Infront of a magistrate who lets them off with a slap on the wrist time and time again. These kids are emboldened to do crime, not even because they have to. But because its fun. And they 100% are guaranteed to get away with it. I don't know if you have ever spent any time in a small rural town, but when there's not a lot of stuff to do, taking a car for a joyride is an alluring prospect. Especially when there is no repercussions for doing so. Not from your family unit. And not from the state. Yes obviously addressing the underlying reasons of poverty and poor parenting is part of the solution. But introducing boundaries and enforcing those boundaries is important for any child's development. The current situation of allowing kids to commit crimes with impunity is part of the problem that needs to be addressed. A child should be scared of breaking into peoples homes and stealing there cars. They should face consequences for doing so. Currently they do not. Which is why they do what they do.
54. Isn’t this just a culture issue where parents should be responsible? If you can’t afford school lunches in the first place you really shouldn’t be pumping out kids. I know there are “exceptions” but it isn’t up to society to pay and feed for your kid just so he won’t go rob someone’s house, or worse violence even. And this is coming from someone who has a kid.
55. It's not a deterrent for underage kids who have no concept of losing the most formative years of their life to a concrete cell. It's not a fix at all *for them*. Every study around the world has concluded it's the worst option in lieu of dozens of other methods, and it's not going to make people find a bag of money under their bed. The problem is poverty, not short sighted thinking. Harsher punishments are a political strategy and a *sweep the problem under the rug* solution.
56. Campaigning on Gaza?
57. Being Hamas adjacent
58. https://greens.org.au/qld/policies/youth-justice Yes, perhaps try reading their policies?
59. > genuine problem we need to solve. Except the LNP didn't offer anything even close to a solution, the methods and things that they put forward are the equivalent to dumping a few 44 gallon barrels of petrol on a fairly tame fire. "Tough on crime" has literally -never- shown to work or have a positive outcome.
60. "I support a woman's right to choose" Is completely incompatible with A) voting against it in 2018, and B) allowing a conscience vote, something he has refused to deny. How is it anything but lip service?
61. Yep. There isn't an easy way around any of it, I think the last thing people really want to see is literal kids doing hard time with real criminals. I suppose getting them in front of better role models would be a start, maybe get them into apprenticeships early, or find real work for them to do that has some kind of rewards and makes mucking up less appealing. Basically distract them from being shitheads, put them in a box with other shitheads and they'll just learn from each other.
62. The experts and other countries have shown harsher sentencing does not have any noticeable effect on youth committing crime. It’s not like they are going to break into a house because there is 3 months in jail, but we increase it to two years then they won’t? Their brains can’t fully understand the consequences of their actions (it grows until 25) and then you add malnutrition, drugs, trauma etc and of course they are going to make bad decisions. We should be trying to help them, not give cruel and unnecessary punishment by sending them off to re-education camps.
63. We should punish the child and let them go hungry because their parents made a bad decision? How heartless are you. To me as an Aussie “mateship” is a core part of that, but you are basically f*ck starving kids - not my problem. It is 100% up to society to make sure every child is cared for. If you die suddenly and your kid ended up in care, I would want them to be fed, educated cared for and loved. How do you not want that for other children?
64. Opposing genocide
65. Missing key details on repeat offenders and hardened criminals, prevention of reoccurrence till after deemed safe to reintegrate and assistance to victims of crime both financially and psychologically. It feels like lacking detail and depth, hard to pin it but it looks like an approach paper that will just get a C+ in uni.
66. Pfffttt.. I was elected to lead... not to read. (Most people - judging by your downvotes)
67. Saying you’ll be tough on crime and over correcting is still going to poll better than trying to tell voters that what they care about isn’t a real problem. I don’t agree with the LNP option, but I had people in this very subreddit shilling hard for ALP trying to tell me car theft isn’t a real issue, when I’ve lived in the same street for 20 years with no car theft for ~17 of them, multiple car thefts per year now. Have had cameras since 2011. 2011 - 2018, nothing. 2019 - now, multiple times per year I get indigenous kids checking our windows and doors in the early hours of the morning. They are not violent, they don’t smash in windows, they don’t steal valuable stuff like tools I’ve left out. They seem exclusively interested in cars, presumably for the purposes of hooning them. They even dumped one of my neighbours cars a block away from where they stole it, with some serious panel damage. I assume it’s for social media clout, but it’s a genuine problem and I have nil sympathy for the ALP losing. Telling the voters they are wrong in a representative democracy shows a stunning level of arrogance.
68. Hey man. Early term and late term are very different. 24 weeks is too late for an abortion under mine and my partners conscience. Which is our opinion. I respect yours even if it’s different than mine, A lot of children that are born at 24 weeks quite often survive. It’s worth checking out images and stats/studies of these children. Late term abortion is very different to banning it blanket. Women have a right to choose but at 24 weeks it’s an actual conscious human child and therefore also deserves a right to live. Before you write your next comment please explore some images of these children. They aren’t an undeveloped foetus they are children with a good chance of living outside of the womb and a lot of them do, wilful ignorance doesn’t help. Edited some mistakes my first language isn’t English sorry
69. Well considering that the current situation is youth offenders face no consequences for their actions, then respectably I have to disagree. The current situation is stealing a car and going for a joyride is done with no consequence. So kids do it because its a bit of fun. I argue that fewer kids would be willing to steal cars and go for joyrides if doing so would garner a 3month to 2 year jail sentence yes. I call bullshit on this harsher sentencing does not have any noticeable effect on youth committing crime rhetoric I keep hearing on this sub. I'm sure there is diminishing returns sure. But holding youth criminals accountable for their behavior each and every time forces intervention, and forces both the youth criminal to reconsider there actions, and there peers to. Also add on the fact that they simply cannot commit further crimes while detained, so at least rest of society is protected from there actions for some period of time. The current system of giving youth criminals a slap on the wrist and being sent on there merry way to reoffend with impunity IS the problem. Edit: I also call bullshit on this "there brain is still developing they cant make rational decisions rhetoric". Yes there brains are still developing. But a teenager is plenty old enough to know that breaking into a house and stealing cars is wrong. We don't give a 21year old a free pass to commit crimes because there brain is still developing. I don't see why we should give a 16year old a free pass.
70. Wouldn’t it be amazing if every child born on earth is happy and has all their needs met and we all just shit rainbows. All we talk about is more handouts to fix every problem. I’m just being realistic here and there’s a difference between tax payers funding every single state school kid food for eternity and targeting those who are in “need”.
71. I have worked, day in and day out, for YEARS with children born 24-26 weeks. Don't think for a second I'm underinformed here, I have a hell of a lot of first hand experience than you. I've bounced a kid on my lap while seeing pics of them in their first days, and seen the pride and joy in their parents faces, and seen how loved and valued they are. I would never, ever wish an unwanted child upon another person. I would never believe a woman's body should be forcibly used to gestate a fetus, much like I don't believe in forced live organ donation.
72. So if a woman is hemorrhaging at 37 weeks, what is the choice? Not every late termination is a wilful abortion
