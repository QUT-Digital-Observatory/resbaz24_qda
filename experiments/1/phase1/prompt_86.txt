Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. I work in IT, my wife in Banking, we're Christians... Both quite conservative people. But we've never even entertained the LNP. It seems they're only trying to make themselves rich and look out for the likes of Gina & Clive, and stuff everyone else. They've run on the fiction of youth crime (my wife volunteer's at a youth detention centre), and the fact of the matter is, it's basically a lie. Then when confronted with an actual partial fix in school lunches, they just try to shit on it.
2. Its quite stupid to scrap them especially given the context surrounding coal plants running up on EOL. I hope that they come to there senses and go through it fully otherwise there will be major issues but I don't think they plan that far ahead.
3. Agree . . the missed opportunity on hydro storage will bite us all in the ass.
4. The LNP aren't the Liberals. They are basically the nationals that rebranded after the name became a bit too dirty in Queensland after Joh.
5. > Oh, you meant the cold-blooded reptile. Could still be talking about Murdoch...
6. Sorry this is wrong. Newspoll has been the most accurate poll for 6 of the last 7 elections
7. >~~Most~~ Murdochs ~~polls~~ are crooks. FTFY
8. It's polling that parties do themselves. Other polling is from independent sources like news and think tanks
9. Their plans to scrap mining royalties, and a few hydro-electric dams should be enough (seriously why the fuck are they making energy diversity and water security partisan positions). But otherwise - their plan to make youth crime worse, and gut state assets and the public sector.
10. To put it simply, The LNPs plans are to put Queensland back twenty years in terms of progress again similar to what they did in 2012-2015 where they gutted the Health department and more, Especially when you consider they are likely to also vote in favour of removing basic health rights like Abortion from being accessed.
11. >Honest question Because the LNP are christian nationalists that want to impose medieval restrictions on woman's health. They believe an omnipotent alien creature that looks like an old European bloke with long white hair and a beard will allow them to come and live with him when they die if they are cruel to woman. Heaven is a place where you get to spend eternity basking in that old man smell. And, anyone that believes that superstitious nonsense should never be in any position of power.
12. Don't you remember how much of a fuck up the last LNP government was between can do cambell terminating front line health care staff and scom fucking off during the bushfires have the LNP actually done anything good for the people
13. But other people will. And it will benefit everyone. Sunshine Coast is in desperate need of decent public transport
14. If by working class you mean people who don't know anything except what Murdoch tells them on his media monopoly, then ok. You are pretty much ass backwards on that though - LNP exist only to enrich the top 0.1%
15. That's why Matt Canavan met Gina Rheinhardts private jet recently and handed her flowers. That sort of working class?
16. I was watching 4 Corners tonight about black voters who vote for Trump. What an eye opener as to how stupid people can be when voting, and their irrational thinking when doing so.
17. Yep. My parents are usually incredibly well-informed when it comes to politics, but I think they’ve been so focussed on the craziness of the US election that they may have actually fallen from the Newscorp/ LMP schtick. Today I might mention their links to the GOP, because when I was talking to my dad, he’s been saying ‘the LNP are matching every Labor policy, and youth crime is bad, and the preventative measures from the camps should work’.
18. Sadly, there will be people who are voting that don’t remember Campbell Newman and what he did with the very team who are running for government now. Additionally, a lot of those people who are considering voting lnp for the ‘ change’ are in opportunities provided for them by labour that the LNP previously slashed .
19. And to send Albanese a clear message: don’t govern this country try just for real estate buyers agents only!
20. Having worked the polls, it's only really reflective of the people who: (1) Pick up a call from a random phone number—especially in the arvo/evening; (2) Do not hang up immediately; (3) Do not hang up when they're asked what age group they fall into; (4) Are older than 40—see all the above; (5) Usually have strong opinions about that election campaign or politics in general. For the information at the end, data is plagued with response bias: e.g., extreme answers, idk answers—*both of these is often related to not caring, or wanting to finish a survey after having a whinge*—and non-response (i.e., those who do not answer tended to vote differently). Accuracy has arguably gotten worse since the death of the landline.
21. I agree the LNP have been going very small target apart from their own stuff ups (i.e. abortion), I've got plenty of criticisms of the ALP too but I really want to be wrong about my initial comment while watching the count on Saturday night.
22. No, they don't deserve it. But in a unicameral system I believe that a strong third and fourth party is the only way that the government could realistically be kept in check. Naturally I think we are moving toward four major parties anyway, due to how divided society is, whether LNP and Labor like it or not. Australians are just notoriously loyal to a brand, so it will take time.

24. Or when Sportsbet paid out an early one million labor victory in 2019... that Labor lost.
25. Well if the corporate LNP-sympathising newspapers say that the LNP is going to win .. who are we to disagree? I for one welcome our LNP propagandist overlords.
26. is part of the reason why they want to get rid of mandatory preferential voting, and just go to optional (where you only have to number one box instead of all of them) because the flow of preferences favours other parties
27. I can see him getting axed over the KAP bill once it gets through as a sort of 'look, the bad guy is gone, we're different now, promise' while continuing to fuck the state exactly the same as they always were.
28. I think he did say that he would resign rather than break his word. 😂😂😂😂😂sorry, I can’t see that happening.
29. https://preview.redd.it/kcge0ribpswd1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca770b353c184368269177c00d43f39fe1b96d72 How Crisafulli views the state of Queensland
30. Tell the people of Townsville that youth crime is a fiction.
31. >don't think they plan that far ahead. They do bit they are just hoping they can continue posturing for their base while waiting for a Labor government to actually do the work.
32. They did the same thing in SA. Labor planned a $600m state owned power plant (was gas and renewable iirc), and the libs wanted to revamp a closed uni building for another aboriginal art museum. Libs won 🤦 but yea I agree that alone should be enough for people to not be dickheads and vote for these clowns. And they are just 2 blimps out of thousands... but fucking gullible sheeple
33. Personally Mining Royalties need to be put back into public health and infrastructure development. Apart from that the less bureaucrats we have in any government. The better it will be.
34. Reproductive Rights are a subject that requires a lot of nuance to understand. What I care about are Nuclear Power Generation, a carbon copy of the US Second Amendment at the top of the state constitution (and tell Canberra to go and get fucked), and vapes being freely available (any shop I go to won't sell to under 18). I also believe in small, limited governance. Which is completely antithetical to what the ALP/Greens represent.
35. Did you see who flew with Albanese on that “skills” summit 2 years ago?
36. That's where you turn around and say 'what policies..? What budget..?'. And his source for the youth crime? One that's not a part of the LNP bullshit dribble that's absolutely everywhere...
37. Well your parents need to become well informed again before voting because the LNP are about to set Qld back a long way.
38. [deleted]
39. KAP or PHON aren't strong third and fourth parties. If ALP get a minority government, they'll just deal with the greens in the crossbench and ignore the nutters. If LNP get in, it'll be the opposite and you really don't want to give the balance of power to PHON or KAP.
40. Thanks the thing is I didn't have to do this and I probably shouldn't have because it's been regressive to me personally. I could and probably should have been be trying to advance myself in other ways but physical pain though not an excuse does alter your mindset. Still it's personal cop out and I should have been trying to make the best with what I have instead of carrying this eternal grudge. As the saying goes "Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves".. Of course there are many other reasons that have already been thrashed out here and I'm glad we were given the opportunity to discus them. I don't know about everyone else but I cant wait to give the internet away for a good few months , be present to the world to focus on the simple things and reconnect with my community. Thanks again and good luck to you
41. Well that is true! Yes, it could happen again.
42. > Well if the corporate LNP-sympathising newspapers say that the LNP is going to win No, we're able to predict a slim LNP majority from the polling data collected by Pyxis Polling & Insights.
43. Pretty much yeah.
44. Yeah I was trying to explain this to my partner. It's so stupid why would I even want to put a number in a party I'd never in a million years agree with. It feels dirty even knowing they used your vote.
45. Props for the use of persona pic in the wild
46. Statically, Youth Crime, even in the Regions, are lower then they've been in years, if not decades. Yes they're are more extreme, although the way they're reported has changed significantly too.
47. What exactly do you think locking up disadvantaged kids is going to do other than create a delayed crime wave for LNP to blame on labour in 8 years? Why not vote for the party trying to fix the root causes instead of the ones slapping a bandaid on a laceration?
48. Please google confirmation bias. Voting should be considered on the greater good, not me,me,me. The best thing we can do is to vote for a party that will cut programs and resources for kids in abusive, addicted and neglectful households. /s
49. Mining royalties are being spent on cost of living and infrastructure initiatives, so that's already being done. And keep in mind the public sector isn't just beureaucrats. It's police officers, fire fighters, paramedics, doctors, nurses, main roads, public transport operators, and so much more than just people sitting behind a desk (though that's not to say they aren't important too). All of which were heavily impacted the last time LNP got into gov, and will almost certainly be back in the firing line this time. I wouldn't put it past them to try and privatise the service provided by Queensland ambulance for instance.
50. People always complain about "bureaucrats" until the public service gets slashed, and then suddenly everyone is whingeing because it turns out that you can't actually run public servives without public servants. When public service cuts hit, you can rest assured that the high-level bureaucrats will keep their fat paychecks. But they'll be more than happy to get rid of the ordinary people on the ground doing actual work to keep the state running.
51. I'd prefer public servants paid 80k a year, over outsourcing those jobs to private firms which cost much more and have less oversight.
52. What the fuck, how old are you? You prioritise policy like an edgy teenage boy from America
53. > Reproductive Rights are a subject that requires a lot of nuance to understand. Not really. Women and girls deserve reproductive rights and access to healthcare. What’s so difficult to understand about that?
54. Sounds like you should be living somewhere that meets those needs, like the US. You'll never get a US style 2nd amendment here. It is simply not a part of our culture like it has been in the US for over 200 years.
55. You want vapes to be sold to u18s? Limited governance is exactly why Australia is a shitshow now. Have you been overseas and seen what first world countries like Singapore do to get that rich. They made sure rule of law is in place and the people get the basics like housing at an affordable price. That takes a lot of government over reach to make sure a country remains affordable for the masses. Neoliberal policies don't make a country better. I wish you westerners wake up to this.
56. Then move to America as No one else wants that.
57. 'i believe in small, limited governance' What u reeeeallllly think u gonna get that under an LNP government? Whos only sole interest is to control control and control. And of course, profit of the backs of the common people. Most laughable shit on this thread
58. reproductive rights the nuance is simple - its only the person who needs to go thru that nightmare of least bad choices who is qualified to make a choice so the law as it is is good, gotta remember the old saying there but for the grace of god go i LNP isnt gonna give us nuclear power either state or fed level sadly and tbh our need for nuclear power in order to enable large scale desalination, indoor agriculture and ecological restoration efforts on any meaningful scale without "culling the masses" is kinda exactly why we need to nationalise the grid cos we dont rlly wanna get plant operators cheaping out on maintenance and shit and we're sick of being rorted by power companies, unluckily (or luckily depending on your perspective) something as controversial as a nuclear power program wont be accepted without such a massive compromise as nationalisation in exchange uhh and if youre concerned with the unsustainable monopoly of violence then plz keep in mind that it was Howard the Coward and his LNP responsible for civilian disarmament in the 1990s and plz do yourself a favour and check out Paul Birch's essays on the right to bear arms and mutual defence, suffice it to say i dont want a carbon copy of the 2nd amendment but i do want a proper bill of rights *with* an accompanying bill of responsibilities like yea we definitely need the right to self defence back but its gotta come with social responsibility (which honestly i dont even trust from most cops) also youre too young to vape dummy but low key agree Greg cHunt rlly screwed the pooch when LNP imposed the first round of vape restrictions way back when which caused the flood of cheap dispos like iGets in the first place do yourself a favour ask your mum to get a script and stick to like a Caliburn or an Xros there are online pharmacies its safer than trusting the dodgy dispos dude plz anyways idk i probs cant convince you to put LNP last but like trust me they wont make life any better for you in the long run and probs not in the short run either
59. So your reason to vote LNP is because you want guns, nuclear energy and nicotine sold to minors? And small limited government? I mean shit at this stage, just vote One Nation, go in the green card lottery and be done with it.
60. If you wanna live in America so bad then go move mate. What's the old saying - "if you don't love it, leave it".
61. Small government/reducing "red tape" is a complete fallacy, as privatisation just shifts this beauracracy into private business, but with more corner cutting and less profits flowing back into the public. Businesses often have some of the worst beauracracy around, especially those taking over public sectors. The results of shifting to 'small governance' can be seen in the US and other countries where they have forced this economic system by force - the results are great for fat cats on company boards and their politician friends, but absolutely abysmal for the functioning of society and those trying to navigate the private sector hell. It doesn't require nuance to see that the LNP (qld resources council) are the worst people to put in charge of reproductive rights, and anything else for that matter. What they want to achieve is better returns for them and their mining sector friends while cutting the services many Queenslanders rely on, because apparently we should not be adequately reimbursed for all the rocks they dig up and immediately flog off to Japan/China/India while destroying large swathes of our environment. Also the freedom for you to suck on a Chinese-made, blueberry flavoured formaldehyde rip stick is not something too high up on my priority list given the aforementioned points.
62. I told them that the only new policy is the abolition of the coal royalties, and how they are the reason Labor can afford such COL relief. Annoyingly, one of their gripes has to do with the Gabba, as they are pro-rebuild and they feel that Labor’s Olympic plan is sub- par.
63. I am so confused as this is incredibly uncharacteristic of them. They have said that they don’t like Crisafooli, yet for some reason they seem to be in the ‘we need to change government to make Labor feel motivated’ camp.
64. Long story short is that it's a guess. The take a very small sample and extrapolate it to fit the nation. E.g. 60 out of 100 said LNP so they assume 60% of Australia will do the same
65. To answer your question: At least with phone sampling it is considered a type of random sampling. That is, the phone numbers are from a massive list and randomly pulled until rejection or completion, so there is less sample bias. Although, it is usually stratified by demographics (I.e., will randomly sampled from within a certain electorate and age group until quotas are filled). However, with the news poll in question, from what I can tell they used a sample of convenience. They sent out surveys to their own mailing list (email) until quotas were filled. The people on the list were thus convenient because they already had easy access (mailing list), and more problematically they had previous contact with the group of people. The problem with this—the issue of sampling choice impacting results, as illustrated in my other comment—is more problematic with this sampling method. You can imagine how someone who has participated in previous paid research or has hopes to be part of paid research again may influence their choice to participate. Moreover, the kinds of people on the mailing list may not be reflective of the general population. Most people do not participate in market research, so people who do may be more knowledgeable and engaged with the process. Thus, the results are only reflective of their own mailing list—people who have participated in market research before. The company obviously tries to weight data by certain features, but they cannot weight it based on response bias due to not being eligible to be sampled. I could go on, but I think the point is salient here. Point is, take it with a grain of salt. Politics is divisive, and most people do not engage with politics. For instance, some people always vote a certain party because that's what they have always done, or their partner/family has done. Others vote based on what is going on for them that year. I think quite a decent proportion of the population who are more iffy or will swing aren't as well captured in these surveys anyways.
66. I agree, and ideally you'd want a party more in the mould of what the Australian Democrats used to be. And ironically it's the Australian Democrats that show that these smaller right wing parties in Queensland may not survive on their own politically after their founders have passed away.
67. Because the vote isn't like that. It's more like a 'top ten' list you see online. You might not have much splitting the anti-nonwhite party and the pro-hit-kids-with-katanas party (sad that both of these exist this election), but they have to sit somewhere on the list relative to each other, even if both are solidly "hell no", and not winning your electorate. It's important more where the "bankrupt the state to build stuff", "shh, trust us, we won't be corrupt" and "shhh, we weren't corrupt, trust us" parties are all similarly popular, and how you sort the "build all the things", "not corrupt, promise" and "learned our lesson, promise" parties affects which one is least hated. (In other parts of the state, it might be a race between the "not corrupts" and "hit your kid with stuff" party, and the votes from one not corrupt, promise party get the kid hitters in, because the two promise parties hate each other.) Otherwise, if you vote for someone you don't think will win, and fail to preference someone who does, your vote can't be allocated in the final run-off (for better or worse).
68. Its ironic that you're calling it stupid when you choose what numbers you write, just put one number.
69. Yea that dungeon is how I think Crisafulli views this state. So i found an image of it online to put here
70. Can't tell that to the boomers on Facebook. Those idiots can't see the forest for the trees.
71. If it was your home being broken in to you may have a different opinion.
72. You can, but even the LNP thinks they went too far down the multinational consultancy accounting route, to the point the government doesn't know things and has to trust KPMG or EY to tell them if KPMG or EY did a good job. Weirdly, KPMG says yes, even if they didn't actually do anything (and bills hundreds of millions of dollars for not doing it). Who woulda thought?
73. A child, they want vapes to be available to everyone and complain that they aren't available to under 18s, only reason that would be a problem for them is if they are under 18. Probably some CoD playing kid with a nicotine addiction with no understanding of politics. No understanding why firearms are restricted or that you can actually own firearms if you pass the requirements. And no understanding why nicotine products are not available to children and why they shouldn't.
74. Check out their active communities. More than 50% have the word “Christian”. That explains enough to me.
75. How exactly do they think that rebuild will be funded? U just told them everything they are scrapping are key incomes for the state already 🤦 Then bring in the other 'policies' and fill in the gaps. Connect it to them personally in some way. I know that can be hard I don't know ur fams personal circumstances. Unfortunately, it also is a generational thing 🤷
76. That's incredibly frustrating and I hope they see what Miles has done and that the cost of living will absolutely go up under Crisafuckwit

79. Crime happens everywhere mate. I got robbed, was uninsured for contents and had thousands of dollars worth of musical instruments and equipment taken. One thing I didn’t do was blame the state government or local children. I copped it on the chin, such is life
80. Kids broke into my house and stole my cars. The LNP doesn’t give a shit any more than Labor did
81. Yeah, I mean.. this entire paragraph was implied in my rhetorical question, but thank you anyway for genuinely trying to give an answer.
82. My parents were born in the 70s, and my dad didn’t move to QLD until the late 90s, otherwise I’d reference Joh, but they don’t really remember much of how he ruined our state.
83. I used those numbers for an example, I know it's larger than that but it's not 24 million, might be a few thousand. And it's not hard to maintain some sort of accuracy when you have a 50/50 chance of getting it right. LNP have been favourites since the start of year so ofcourse the news would say they would win....however it you believe the same news articles, labour is now favourite as of last night. 🤷‍♂️ who is right?
84. > Most pollsters don't call landlines. Last I checked, phone polls included mobiles and landlines (mobiles being more heavily weighted). Bigger polls conducted maybe once or twice an election cycle might use phones. > That's not how majority of the current polling firms... > Most polls are online using market research panels... These are contradictory statements. I read the YouGov methodology for the Australian's newspoll. So this last statement is exactly what I'm referring to, when I say it's a sample of convienence (using mailing lists), and mainly reflective of those who participate in market research with the relevant company conducting the poll.
85. Yeah, but your not letting feelings get in the way of facts, duh
86. Anytime. I'm nothing if not known for occasionally missing rhetorical questions.
87. [deleted]
88. Hey man, we all do, that's why I tried not to be rude. I missed one last night and I've still got a Real Smart Guy™ trying to convince me I'm a dumbass 🤷
