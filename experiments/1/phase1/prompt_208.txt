Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. they have. whats your point. also LNP is way worse. Crisafuckwit's trying to gut the healthcare system.
2. Another escapee from the gene pool. Don’t breed
3. It's not about persuading opponents. It's about reminding the undecided that voting on the basis of it just being "TiMe fOr a ChAnGe" is foolish. It's a form of theatre because most voters aren't interested in logic or reason. There's different strategies for communicating with different voters.
4. Steven’s been called every insult under the sun for the past 10 months but some random guy on reddit can’t make a joke about David?
5. What? Are you saying conservatives can't take a joke?
6. Nothing more impartial then giving equal time to climate science and some random person who 'has some concerns (and works for Chevron)'
7. Both parties have corrupting influences. Do you want to vote for the party controlled by workers collectives or the party corrupted by corporate interests?
8. Better vote for the corrupt thugs instead then
9. You can't support the LNP and still claim to be a good person though.. Labor is focused on investing in public housing, affordable transportation, reduced energy bills, free school lunches, increased regional hospital access, and more bulk billing doctors. These policies not only support communities but also contribute to lower crime rates. In contrast, the LNP is proposing to send children to (privately owned) prisons and re-education camps—approaches(Newman already did this) that have proven ineffective for long-term crime reduction and offer no real chance for recovery, all while neglecting those who are struggling. We have the best-run state in the country, led by a premier who is willing to tackle problems strategically. We’re witnessing the strongest leadership we’ve ever had, especially in contrast to the LNP's weak alternatives. Moreover, they’re threatening to criminalize abortion, and while Chrisafulli has promised to resign if crime rates drop, he hasn’t made a similar commitment regarding abortion. He knows he can't control that issue.
10. The mining industry is 60% of our exports. The LNP practically gave away the rights to our natural resources and locked it in place for 10 years. That's billions taken from you and given to overseas investors. We finally have that freeze stopped and are finally able to contribute back to our state for our state's resources. They still make BILLIONS a year but are not happy about having to pay their fair share like the rest of us so they've thrown money behind the campaign against Labor. So the LNP will definitely give away free stuff just not to the people of Queensland.
11. Wait, you think state govt control inflation?
12. "Switch it up from time to time" lol. Unless they're gonna benefit the people, which the LNP have clearly said they won't do, change for the sake of change isn't helpful.
13. Not when one party is as useless and morally bankrupt as the LNP
14. Do you say that for Japan?
15. guys i think we found our king
16. Yes but it's equally as valid to call out stupidity. We honestly have a pretty sweet setup.
17. I vote for the party that’s nice to me on the way into the polling place
18. Do you really think an LNP government would reform zoning and development laws?? I agree Labor should have done that but the LNP would be far worse.
19. Comparing Labour’s inaction to LNP’s complete lack of morality, destructive self-interest and outright harmful policies is an interesting take…
20. So what land or business do you own that is going to benefit from the LNP government? Declare your conflict of interest now.
21. See that's the thing. It's a wedge, when you point out it's technically overblown as a state issue it comes across as dismissing it. To those who experience and see it, it's more real than anything else. But to me, it's not an issue I would justify throwing everything else out for to fix, and I know the LNP won't even fix it either These crimes do occur. But Labor at least provides social services that help prevent crime and reduce repeated offenders. Throwing people in jail alone, already pretty full, is not a solution by itself. But it sounds tough, quick and easy to do. The lnp will also cut those services and also police officers, which was two things they did last time. But that's the point. Every election cycle media and lnp do the same thing. They pick a targeted issue to attack, and run endlessly on it. Will they solve it, no. But they will talk a big game and make a big show of it. And then we can't even have a discussion on any actual issue, or others, because its become poisoned
22. There's been a youth crime issue for all of my 51 years, what makes it different now? I'll answer that for you, it's media, they blow up the issue of the day and create panic because they make money from it. The fact is there has been a reduction in youth crime of 18 percent since 2012.........seems like it's a big nothing burger, except of course to the victims, but as I said, they have been there forever.
23. Labor doesn't have a u in it and people will disregard your opinion if it does fyi
24. Child crime is down but hey let’s not let the truth get in the way of the msm and lnp lies! It would be good if there were trustworthy independents standing with labor and lnp so voters can vote for someone without party interests but the community interests.
25. If you think the stolen cars will stop with LNP you are dreaming.
26. Being somewhere that isn't actively abusing them, with food, out of the elements, and with people who have to pay attention to you, if not actually care? Of course for some it's gonna be better. Hell, you might even pick up a trade cert or the ability to read. And only get lightly assaulted. Still a trade some of em will make because their home life is that bad. The solution isn't abusing them more in juvi than they cop at home. It won't fix their victims to rehabilitate them, but it is much better at prevention than further abuse.
27. This sub and most Australian subs are pandering towards certain agendas. Having reasonable concerns about public safety and crime rates does not suit the agenda. I welcome the downvotes i will be recieving
28. From what I know, LNP policies are predicted to increase crime, so idk
29. Media =/= Rudd Thanks for your imput
30. I remember it as "New Leadership". But that federal government destroyed itself from the Work Choices fiasco. Ronald McDonald would have won against John Howard.
31. This is the dumbest thing I’ve read all day. Rudd got us through the entire GFC not only unscathed but we’re only one of few countries that had any market growth at all. Now id rather leverage debt to avoid an Australian market shakedown then whatever the fuck the LNP did to quadruple our overall debt over their ten years https://independentaustralia.net/politics/politics-display/coalition-adds-more-debt-in-nine-months-than-labor-did-in-under-six-years,14261
32. Yeah, there was nothing that happened in 2007-2008 that justified a lot of government stimulus spending!
33. Yeah not like there was a worldwide recession or an anything but no blame Rudd. Good one.
34. Not to the extent you think, it’s quite polarising how Rudd now sits with Rupert today and how one man can influence democracy. https://amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/02/rupert-murdoch-australia It’s also quite funny how you didn’t actually read my sentence as it was located within the decade of federal LNP and not Rudd at all…get some glasses
35. What’s the bet they’ll also vote crisafullashit?
36. Yeah same I miss Jenny
37. Thats debatable. Jenny was all kinds of shit. I swear she was high on cocaine most days. Troy has his problems, but arguably he hasn't done any worse than Jenny. If anything, he actually did argue on behalf of the rate payer.
38. Wish this subreddit supported gifs, nothing more appropriate that Walter White saying "Fuck you and your eyebrows"
39. Any particular reason why or are you just an angry reditor looking to be angry.
40. I always like to point out that every kid that's committing crimes is a descendant of a boomer
41. should RBA make a case and present to the parliament and then get decide if the rate should move? i really dont know if that will make any better or worse. Essentially economist working at RBA digs down the stats and figures and decide the rate. If that function moves to parliament, MPs would need to vote based on the information presented to them. (by similar background economists) Cash rate is such a brutal instrument and difficult to measure the immediate outcome, we can blame RBA for making change, but if it goes to the parliament, people will blame the parliament too. Cant win.
42. I mean maybe we should? [https://futurework.org.au/post/chalmers-is-right-the-rba-has-smashed-the-economy/](https://futurework.org.au/post/chalmers-is-right-the-rba-has-smashed-the-economy/)
43. Interest rates should be outside of the RBA and Parliament. A third party should be doing it.
44. >no country has ever taxed its way to prosperity And no country has been prosperous without taxation.
45. “No country has ever taxed its way to prosperity” actually damn near every prosperous nation did *exactly* that.
46. For everyone who does not own home more social housing means better living conditions. No more horrible rentals with abusive landlords and real estate agents. However to get there we need to tax those stinky landlords and their agents and use this money to build more government owned homes for us. That is Greens policy. We have around 30% renters, its a mystery why Green vote less than that number.
47. oh i am absolutely not trying to change minds, its a meme.
48. I'd say it's not overly common for people to vote on this logic alone. If people are voting *against* Labor instead of *for* the LNP it's useful to acknowledge why this might be the case instead of throwing names around. For starters, it's pretty hard to convince people to disregard the biggest housing and cost of living crisis in living memory that, whether you like it or not, happened under Labor's watch.
49. a lot of ppl wont even read policies or research who they're voting for. so many ppl just vote for the colour and feeling. How often you hear LNP is a better economical managers, and support business, etc, when in fact opposite is true? I know few ppl vote because of this, and usually surprised to hear LNP policy is not what they want to support.
50. [deleted]
51. The only LNP policy I can see is that they’ll still tax the mining companies? The mining companies were taxed before Labor as well.
52. People have spoken
53. Both are bad, whataboutisms are bad. Why is this so hard to understand?
54. No, he's calling them dirty bogans.
55. Huh, bankers are workers collectives now? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Banking_Association What's that? Thuggery? https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/sep/17/cfmeu-faces-fresh-investigations-into-alleged-corruption-in-queensland-nsw-and-sa-branches So why are they not following their promise? https://amp.abc.net.au/article/104102408#amp_ct=1729743572447&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&aoh=17297435434472&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com
56. union thugs helping people? or the corrupt thugs helping the big business? what a tough question.
57. Late term abortions of healthy pregnancies should be restricted, and that is a popular sentiment. That the uninformed are being misled by a Labor disinformation campaign is disappointing but not surprising. Only the truly sick minded believe that healthy pregnancies past the point of viability should be able to be aborted. Regarding crime, Labor have been dismissive of the issue for some time now, and with rates increasing outside of SEQ it is clear that their current approach is not working. Regarding 50c transportation, again outside SEQ there is limited benefit. Regarding public housing, how many public housing projects has Labor delivered outside SEQ, relative to population? Regarding hospitals and health, how many birthing services have closed in the last 30 years under majority Labor, and how much has hospital ramping increased? Regarding GPs, why has it gotten to the point it is at now with only a promise to fix it? Regarding school lunches, why has Labor been ignoring these neglected children until now, and why has there not been an investigation into child services ignoring mass cases of neglect? The Labor party, but Miles in particular, are ghoulish thugs. >You can't support the LNP and still claim to be a good person though. You're not a bad person for falling for Labor's lies, just ignorant. The evil would be if you still supported them after looking into the above. I don't support the LNP, I just support Labor and the Greens less. My vote went to Margie, who Labor abused and defamed after she dared to run against them. Labor are thugs.
58. Ya, in my magical fairy world both parties have good but diffrencing opinions.
59. Hard agree, it's just a fantasy world where both parties have policies that benifit the people, just with different strategies. Too much to ask for.
60. I only keep up with highlights in Japan, but haven't they had the same party for like 80% of their democracy? And they do have some severe political issues that need to be worked on. Look all I want is for 2 parties to compete with each other with policies that benifit the people, is that too much to ask? Also why would you even bring up specifically Japan?
61. stupid people can vote too, it’s part of democracy. doesn’t matter whether the current setup works or not.
62. that will totally work
63. Ah yes there is no excuse for not voting labour unless you are a rich capitalist pig?
64. Yeah I agree. I'll concede that as someone living in Brisbane, the youth crime issue might be a big reality for people living elsewhere that I just don't see. So I would understand the temptation to vote for the party who is emphasising that issue. But just using common sense, the policies the LNP are proposing to fix the issue are terrible... authoritarian punishment does not help. Some of Labor's policies e.g. free school lunches would legitimately help the issue far more.
65. It's not about abusing people, it's about making the deterrent to the crime an actual deterrent. If there is incentive to go into juvi because it's better, then they will actively continue to do the crime to get there. Hence broad daylight robberies, or breaking in while people are sleep. I don't want to ruin some kids life either, and I believe in rehabilitation, but wrong is wrong and that needs to be understood. Like I say, the real issue is the upbringing and home situation, but that doens't mean you make committing crime and it's deterrent an escape for them either. If your kid stole some shit do you reward them? I don't get it, man. I want these lost teens to figure their stuff out, but you can't essentially get rewarded for doing heinous crimes. Come on, now. Whatever we are doing now is not working, QLD Youth is up 6-7% in the last year for example. It aint working.
66. He was definitely a media darling going in
67. Murdoch papers supported Rudd for PM.
68. Such as pink bats? That was a winner.... There was way too much stimulus spent then and on dumb shit, just as there was over spending for Covid stimulus. All of that needs to be paid back at some point. Ahh, my grandkids problem hey. Keep the free shit rolling out/s.
69. Not everyone thinks Keynesian economics are a great approach
70. Not to the extent I think? Some of the papers literally came out and endorsed Rudd and said it was time for a change. How is it any less extent than that? And yes, the papers endorsed Labor while the LNP were still in power.
71. You miss rising rates and Townsville stagnation?
72. Think it might be the hundreds of Australians dead as Howard followed the US in the name of his racially charged ‘Anglosphere’ across the Middle East
73. >Any particular reason why If you are asking that you are either pretty young or a rusted on conservative.
74. Turkey tried that and they went into hyper inflation. Interest rates are used mainly to control the value of the currency and everyy little change moves billions of dollars. Just earlier this year, Japan increased its interest for the first time in a decade and it caused $3 trillion dollars to return from global assets back to Japan. Central banking is pretty much black magic ran by math nerds who have to take everything into account.
75. Made no mention of removing taxes, Middle class already gets hit hard with the taxes we already have in place.
76. Right, Argentina is a great example of a country for such answer of a country not taxing itself into prosperity, before Javier took over, shows what adding more taxes when not needed looks like and the damage it does with the domino effect it takes.
77. `However to get there we need to tax those stinky landlords and their agents and use this money to build more government owned homes for us.` Yes, lets tax those who own more than just 1 home and not think of what will happen from that, like owners pulling out of the rental market all together, reducing the supply of rental properties increasing the demand even further for housing or jacking up rents to increase profit off-sett , it's not a well-thought-out policy it certainly sounds nice on paper, but it's not the answer.
78. Sure but it doesn’t take much logic to realise that cutting the coal royalties completely will put cost of living relief measures such as electricity rebates in jeopardy. Additionally cutting royalties could also jeopardise road upgrades too.
79. And can you therefore point out which QLD Labor policies directly caused said housing and cost of living crisis which affects not just QLD but the entire country?
80. They weren’t to blame for the Cost of Living crisis and have directed us through it better than the LNP could ever hope to
81.

83. Standards for thee but not for me...
84. Both major parties are funded by the banks. I conceded that unions can be a corrupting influence. A vote for the LNP is a vote to give away our states resources to foreign companies - Labor will tax these companies and spend that money on Qlders
85. This isn’t just about late-term abortions, is it? It includes all abortions, and suggesting that women seek late-term procedures in viable pregnancies is deeply insulting to all women. My friend needed an abortion when she was fighting for her life against sepsis; without that option, she would have left two young children behind. It's frustrating to see that reality being reframed to fit a narrative you can swallow. [https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/97218](https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/97218) Do you actually find Labors statements on what they're doing for youth crime dismissive? Regarding the claims about the 50 cents, why would you include a policy both are keeping like it's a point against them? I’m not sure why that’s relevant to your framing of Labor as evil. Are you seriously going to ignore the LNP eliminated 14,000 healthcare jobs as if that's not part of the reason? I know you can look up that it's due to a workforce shortage & declining birth rates and there's still no LNP plan to address that either especially when birth rates will continue to fall if women have no access to safe healthcare if abortion is abolished and the LNP does not expand healthcare like Labor will. The rest is just policies that genuinely benefit the state, yet you seem to downplay their importance while ignoring the fact that the LNP has no viable alternatives. This approach seems disingenuous, and it’s disappointing to see such bad faith. You know historically the LNP absolutely wreck our state. Most people's best interest is not voting LNP unless you are a corporation and the mining companies are upset their tax freeze is no longer in place. *The opposition really shouldn't stand a chance and it's frustrating to see the reasoning people are giving.* The last time they were in charge they lost 36 seats. They sold schools, stopped infrastructure, gave mines tax cuts, cut essential healthcare workers with severance just to have to rehire them months if not weeks later, tried to sell off QLD Rail, tried to sell off breast cancer screening, businesses started failing just 2 years in & their new leader is a level of corrupt having to pay 200k for stealing government money. The last time the LNP were in for more than one term we got Inquiry into Allegations of Misconduct in the Investigation of Paedophilia in Queensland from the crime and corruption commission where their leader under oath admitted to it and you voted for *that* and *against* energy rebates, publicly owned fuel stations, price caps on fuel, 10 new police beats, 900 more police, 3 new hospitals, 11 expansions on hospitals, 7 satelite hospitals, 22 more hospital beds, 16k healthcare workers, 2k ambos, 1.9b mental health plan, 50 bulk billion gov owned clinics, school based gps, manufacturing in maryborough, 37b infrastructure, bruce hwy upgrade, inland freight route, bremer river bridge, barron river bridge, bribie island bridge, cross river rail, sunshine coast direct rail, logan + GC rail expansion, fee free tafe, free tools for apprenticeships, 26b energy infrastructure, 288M at risk student support, 6 pathway colleges, 140k laptops for students, 2kstuden support staff, protecting taxation of coal & protecting human rights.
86. This! One day I hope for this fairy. But I doubt it haha
87. Pretty sure its over 90%, and my point is how good a country runs isn't determined by how often it changes, it's on the policy and how represented the public is, and Cris is no mining royalties, children in jail, and saying "I'll explain how my policy works after I am elected". What good representation.
88. You summoned it up perfectly.
89. You need to change the lives they currently live. And it's a bigger project than just whatever hit the headlines recently. I work with stats so there's a lot to be said about the ones on youth crime, but I also work with folk who do active research and outreach. There's a point at which unless you're going for torture and murder then detention is not a deterrent - it's safer than home AND an opportunity to learn more criminal skills. You make crime the trigger for diversion. Which works and keeps on working at much higher rates than detention. It doesn't work on everyone all the time - just like there are kids with good situations who commit crime - but overall? Diversion, outreach, proper community support and education do far more for crime prevention than increased detention rates or worse prisons.
90. It should work like that except youth don't think they'll be caught and their brains prefrontal cortex aren't developed yet to think about long term consequences. We have guns out here and you'd think that'd be the biggest deterrent and they still stole BMX bikes from our property. I watched some of the debates and the only things I saw David bring up was 3&6 month check ins & rehabilitation camps (that have already been tried and closed by Newman because they didn't work iirc) so I don't think he'll do much of anything to help. I read this though [https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/97218](https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/97218) apparently they can get 10 years for having your car so maybe it's the courts not willing to sentence them?
91. then he tried to change the terrible system made by LNP's and actually did things that a PM should do. then they changed their tune.
92. Well if we’d owned or taxed our resources like Qatar and Norway it wouldn’t be a problem would it? We’d pay it back in a minute, but nooo libs wanna sell everything off to their mates for a song.
93. That's where mining taxes comes in.
94. Yeah Kevin shouldn’t have spent so much just because some silly GFC was ruining lives globally.
95. Your grandkids actually blame you for voting in a government that squandered the wealth of the early 2000s resources boom. Don't pretend like your concern is for their wellbeing.
96. >Such as pink bats? That was a winner Would have been if we didn't let private enterprise get involved. Also, what was the debt increase between 2013 & 2022?
97. Did the GFC really pass by without you noticing?😂
98. You mean the Keynesian approach that rescued Australia from any major economic impact from the GFC? Or the Keynesian approaches that rebuilt the world following WWII? Those people can disagree all they want but the results speak for themselves.
99. So a paper endorses labor once and suddenly the world is collapsing. But when more then 50 collective Murdoch newspapers consistently endorse the LNP like they have over years and years it’s “eh who cares” (the herald sun has endorses the last 5 lnp elections for example) what fair and great media wowee
100. At least she was allowed in the building, not banned for being a lying nut job
101. That's a reason, but not the only reason.
102. Or... and just bear with me a second... I am interested. Because I am neither of those things you mention.
103. Then we put in taxes that hit high income earners and high corporate profits.
104. Yeah, because Argentina is *obviously* top of mind when you think of prosperous countries. You’re pretty obviously going to argue bad faith shite, so have a good one I’ve got better things to do.
105. >like owners pulling out of the rental market all together, The houses still exist dude, there is no net loss of housing if an investment property owner sells up.
106. oh well, how will you solve the problem then? Do nothing and let landlords take increasing advantage from the current situation?
