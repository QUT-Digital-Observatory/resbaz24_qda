Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. This maybe your opinion that close to the strand is the only place here worth living but I like living in bushland beach never had a problem here a lot of my friends live at Yarrawonga and northward garbutt and railway estate and they and their neighbours are constantly having break ins stolen cars and home intrusions in board daylight. People living in yarrawonga can barely feel safe washing their car!
2. I found cost of living lower there, food, power, insurances were all lower. Cost of housing is now higher but wasnt *that* much higher at the time. When my car insurance came up for renewal it was by chance that I updated my new living address and literally the price halved, and the person from the insurance company said to me it was due to crime and weather of North Queensland. Which I found puzzling since Brisbane is known to hail somewhat regularly.
3. Police are public servants though… and for sure, I would have written police.
4. The council can request the extra resources from the government. Thats one of the ways to get the resources. Cops are paid to relocate all the time. Especially newer ones to get their first big posts.
5. Easy, you just get them from NZ. 300 NZ police applied to join the qld force in July.
6. Theres nothing really I can do. We moved into a rental to suss out Townsville for a year. So we cant make any modifications to the property. Cant get a dog. I feel helpless and not supported by the council and government and police. I fear for my family.
7. The Anglos haven't called me a white c%%t, hounding me for money or anything like that.
8. [deleted]
9. Bit of nothing that suburb.
10. Bushy Beach and North Ward/Castle Hill are pretty similar. [https://qps-ocm.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/index.html](https://qps-ocm.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/index.html)
11. Agree, it just reads weird and suggests to me they are capturing more than just police.
12. More police wouldn't solve the issue anyway. The problem is the magistrates not doing anything with the ones that get caught. There is no deterrent to youth crime, I takes literally hundreds of offenses before there is a consequence outside of saying sorry or a curfew that has no punishment when it is broken.
13. you clearly don’t know what ur talking about. Plus there is a new Kirwan Police Facility being built with more coppers..
14. Well, you can choose how to respond to this.. you can’t make modifications but you can request an upgrade in security measures for the house. Getting a dog isn’t going to solve this problem for you, all a dog will do is add a deterrent to the property, and that’s only if you train it properly. I honestly think it’s a bit rich that you blame the council for this when they aren’t responsible for law enforcement and deployment of police to problem areas. This town is what you make of it. It’s either going to be shit and you’re going to remain miserable and scared, or you can look at all the positives and make the best of the situation. You aren’t powerless to this problem. At least you have a house, some people don’t. At least you haven’t been injured by the crime, others have. Make sure you have contents insurance, lock your cars, lock your house, make sure your windows are not accessible and be vigilant. If you look like you’re poor from the outside view of the house you’re less likely to be targeted also.
15. If you don't mind me asking, is your house a typical Kirwan deal where the house is part of the fence? Like it just opens the garage on to the street?
16. Because they aren't poor and black, probably.
17. I've been over that way for 4 years and not a single *serious* issue like I've heard about elsewhere in town. One young fella thought he'd be smart and hang off the outside of my fence next to my cars but my dog grabbed his arm before anything got out of hand.
18. Unlike Kirwan and the Strand, Aitkenvale is actually central and actually has access to whatever you need. You have Stockland there for most things, there's work there, and if you need to go elsewhere, all the buses stop there.
19. Similar-ish northward is still higher than bushy for unlawful entry and other theft as well as just unlawful entry so to say near the strand is better when it's actually worse 🤨
20. Great page tho!
21. [deleted]
22. Second aitkenvale, you just have to find the hidden gem houses and streets. Lots of old people that have owned houses for 40-50 years so it's generally quiet. No more than 15 minutes to anywhere.
23. Anywhere worth going to is near the Strand, you don't need to be central to travel out to Kelso.
24. If you don't want to rely on a car, you do.
25. Where are you going?
26. Work, shops, friends places. Nowhere in the city, the city sucks.
27. The city does suck
28. Townsville is great if you love nature and wildlife and the outdoors. The weather takes a little to get used to; especially moving here in Summer. So start off indoors 😅, but relief comes when winter roles around. It’s a great time to get out and about. If you don’t scuba dive already, it’s a great place to get into it. Or climbing. And there are clubs at JCU so you can meet people and make friends. JCU has dorms, but it depends on your budget. I’ve heard they can be a little pricey. I think you’re better off jumping on FB and joining the JCU students groups about accommodation. Share houses are the norm I think. Nightlife isn’t huge, but it’ll do if you’re drunk and not fussy😅. People will comment here about the crime. It’s not that bad in terms of personal safety - I’m a woman and I don’t feel unsafe walking around at night. But kids steal cars, so just be sensible. Overall, Townsville is a pretty great place if you like a slower pace and less traffic and lots of sunshine. If you like shopping and cold weather, maybe not.
29. I lived in a share house with two vet students who grew up elsewhere. They enjoyed it there and seemed to have a good study/life balance. The had enough social interactions throughout the year with other students from what I saw. I moved up from Sydney about 10 years ago and have loved the relaxed lifestyle. People will act like it's like moving to the Bronx but as long as you're security conscious, crime won't impact your life. If you end up moving up there and get stuck with anything, give me a yell
30. make sure you lock both wheels on your bike
31. I moved from Brisbane to go to JCU and moved back a year later cause I hated it so much. Despite everyone else’s comments, I personally have not had a good experience with crime, finding a rental, and the climate. As someone from a big city, there is absolutely nothing to do here but outdoor activities for which it’s too hot 90% of the time. Townsville to me feels like a big retirement village with a few army blokes thrown into the mix 😂
32. I study vet and am also from close to where you are, the only thing keeping me here is uni. The uni is great, despite JCU letting in people who achieve lower atars, you'll graduate better than majority of other vet graduates from around Aus if you put in a bit of effort. The vet cohort also has an amazing culture, we do so much fun shit. Join the facebook page JCU Vet Students Association. As for Townsville, its a hole. The weather suck, the crime is laughable and theres nothing to do here apart from drink. Slowly theres more markets, events on the strand etc. but you go through the free entertainment options pretty quickly. The weather is pleasant for two months of the year. There are very nice camping spots/nature spots around, however they are a good hour drive, crystal creek a bit less than an hour, but theres only so much fuel you feel like burning as a uni student. One positive, the town is very young being full of uni students and army people (but do avoid the AJs), and the traffic is minimal. It is a very laid back bogan place, pleasantly humble! As for college, John flynn or Saints if youre social, BY if youre looking for more apartment style, avoid George Roberts. Plenty of share houses going around too, join the facebook group called JCU Townsville Accomodation or something like that. Students tend to live in Annandale, Douglas, Aitkenvale area, howver Douglas gets hit really hard with car theft etc. I am very negative about it here, but I have made some great friends and met my partner here and definitely don't regret it, but I will be moving away the second I graduate.
33. I have just recently moved away from Townsville myself. I love Townsville. It's fairly laid back, easy to get from one side of town to the other in 20 minutes. You have 2 beautiful beaches at your doorstep and many others within. 20 minutes drive. If you love the outdoors, you will enjoy living in Townsville. I lived there for 43 years *touches wood* and I wasn't broken into once, never felt unsafe walking down the street. Just like anywhere, just be aware of your surroundings. Don't forget you also can escape to Magnetic Island for about $35 ferry ride return and the snorkeling over there is beautiful. It's only a 25 minute ferry ride. Then you have the creeks and tributaries around. As long as you're not looking for night clubbing and banging scenes like that, you will like Townsville. We also do have most of the shops that the south has, I say most but not all. But you can always order online anything else. Good luck with your decision my friend!
34. Just moved up from Sydney and love it way more here!
35. I suppose its what you make of it. If you love the outdoors, theres heaps to do around. And considering you are joining a program, socialising will be 100% easier for you. However, moving from Sydney it will be a change. Its very laid back here. Towns dead throughout the week and a few places pop off during the weekend. But on the bright side, no traffic and everything is <20 mins away. Finding a place to stay is a hassle but im sure thats the case eveywhere. When I relocated here for work 1.5 years back, I had a relocation bonus that essentially lasted me 2 weeks of airbnbing. I found my unit within that timeframe but I wasnt choosy and went with the first place that accepted me. My advice would be to do the same but to sign the least possible lease period i.e 3 months or 6 months. Once youre in tsv for that youll have a better gauge about your movements and what areas you like. Also, public transport here isnt the best so might want to focus in finding a place close to uni. Godspeed.
36. JCU is great, it’s a whole life without ever leaving campus. If you love wildlife and outdoors it’s really groovy there.
37. i like townvillle done about 20 years here now it got all the service of a city without a long drive to get to them. personal live in share house but you can try dom life if you drive cheaper to share house. thing to do there lots nature and maggie wildlife there look at group. just rember sydeny only short flight away
38. Renting in TSV is hard. I've lived all over Oz, even during the rental crisis in Brisbane I was able to get a rental, here, I'm rejected for everything and I'm a public servant. I tried to share with others but didn't have any like finding anyone to share with, most were middle aged men with questioable intent however there's a few houses around Douglas that rent rooms to uni students, they are often advertised in realestate.com if you just look up Douglas as the suburb. I am an avid outdoor lover and I can tell you there's not alot of outdoor fun to be has here that doesn't come with large crowds (the strand is very popular, as is castle hill and magnetic island is a headache during peak season in my opinion. You need to drive a couple hours away to get some good outdoor time. The wetlands here at town common are excellent for bird life and a few hours of hiking. There's even crocodiles in there that you can see living life in the wild. Being young you might be more easily pleased then myself so keep in mind my comments are from a jaded tired woman twice your age haha.

40. Townsville like most of Australia it's very hard finding accommodation ATM I do suggest reaching out to Townsville guest house on stagpole st, It can be your home while you look for something more permanent Damian is a great landlord but rooms are subject to availability. You can also try the hotel in hermit park/mundingburra its on the main drag to rosslea they have rooms for $400pw All the best in your search for a place to live in Townsville. Its a great city and people greet you a stranger in the street.
41. I was born in Townsville, but moved away around 21. It’s changed a bit since then but not really for the better. I’ll probably get downvoted for this, but unfortunately it can be pretty homophonic/racist(part of why I moved away) however you can still find good people. As for the Vet science course at JCU, it’s actually pretty great from what I can tell. I have several friends who studied Vet science at JCU, I even dated one; they all loved it. They were all very close with one another, and I think the people I met through those friends were all great people, so it shouldn’t be hard to make friends. All I can say is if you end up living on campus, prepare for a pretty hectic drinking culture.
42. Townsville is a shit hole. There is no silver lining. It will be tough. It may break you.
43. Don't.
44. Appreciate this, nightlife being a buzzkill doesn’t bother me thankfully. I definitely would be keen to learn to scuba and as a wildlife photographer, would love to check out the areas frequently. Thank you!
45. Your last sentence answers the question perfectly
46. Much appreciated!
47. Noted.
48. Guess everyone fits into places differently, just got to hope it’s somewhere I’ll fit into as I’ll be stuck for 5 years, If I decide to move here 😅The climate will definitely take getting used to but hopefully it’s bearable.
49. What have you loved most about the change?
50. Thank you!
51. No worries at all, I appreciate the comments and advice!
52. I have heard good things about their program also and how practical they train the vets to be. Glad you’ve had a good experience with the clinic that’s great to hear. I appreciate the advice on accomodation but it’ll probably be awhile before I find a more permanent solution as I find my footing and look for some work.
53. Sorry to hear you had a rough experience, it’s never great. Glad to hear that you’ve heard good things about the culture of vet science at JCU, fills me with a bit more hope adapting to such a big change. Much appreciated!
54. Yes, "Thank you." is always helpful.
55. Honestly you won’t be stuck, if you decide you don’t like it after 12 months, you can always transfer to another university. Don’t stress! Come on over and give it a shot here. Lots of people from out of State really enjoy it here and make lifelong friends.
56. past student here. loved mount lofty. i was a centenary student first and hated it there. i was scared to move to lofty at first but it was the best years of my schooling life there and i wish i started out there
57. I didn't go there but remember them having a pretty good music program around 2000-2015 area. They would often do pretty well in Eisteddfod comps and things like that.
58. Past lofty student, graduated in 2005 and it was a good school then. But that’s a long time ago now so things might have changed but I look fondly on my high school years.
59. Do it. It's better than centenary 100 times over. Smaller school, they've got a good performing arts area and better student support. My best mate went to centenary and I honestly believe he wouldn't have as many issues with drugs as he does if he never went to that fucking school
60. I am currently doing some releif teaching in Toowoomba. TSHS is my favourite by far. Smaller class sizes (and school size), strong leadership, long-term teaching staff, family extensive sporting facilities, and generally amicable student population. Also, good elective subjects options I wouldn't have expected to see in a public school. Good luck with transitioning if you decide to go ahead.
61. Recent past student. I thought it was run of the mill. It happened to work out great for me, but not because it's a great school. From what I hear it's getting worse in terms of property damage, required security, and lock downs. Pushes a lot of it's funding and focus into the arts. I can and will complain about that until the end of time, but as a result all of my "difficult" stem classes were super small, and as a result better. Also some phenomenal teachers who deserve more credit.
62. Past student here. Many years now. I did not find it to be a good school. Still remember windows missing in some classrooms and freezing in winter. Principal at the time was awful. Bullying was an issue at the time. But many years ago like I said so I'm sure things may have changed. I would have chosen Wilsonton campus. Friends I had there loved it and my husband went there too, also loved it.
63. My daughter is in year 12 at lofty and we have always found the school great, no issues at all
64. Fuck no it worst then gulag
65. I liked My Loft but it has been a long time since I went there Ran into my old Maths teacher last year, was a new teacher when I first started there in my 20years now. But I don't know what that means for the school.
66. Most of the kids I knew who went to Lofty really liked it - it seems like a really relaxed place with newish facilities now. I went to St Ursulas but kind of wish I went there. (im 32 so this was a long time ago)
67. My kids graduated within the last few years. I don't regret sending my kids there. There were good times and bad times. They did drop the ball for one of my kids but COVID was a part of the cause so I can't say the same would happen today.
68. Yesss. The school I go to is Centenary and it still sucks. Seriously bad drug culture and the bullying against mentally issued students is insane. That's why I'm considering moving.
69. same situation here but graduated 8 years ago (god that makes me feel old), lofty was so much better, especially for any flexibility needed related to mental health
70. I'm a very musically talented and oriented student, so I'm seriously considering it
71. As a student who fell into the drug culture in centenary and was lucky enough to find support to help me, it's horrific. I'm definitely making the change
72. Thank you, I will most likely do it :)
73. Haha wow, I went to wilsonton campus for 8-10 and lofty for 11-12. My kids will never set foot on wilsonton campus for any reason.
74. I enjoyed wilsonton when I was there but I wouldn't send my child there now. I'd be open to lofty, though. Some of the good teachers I had across Wilsonton and Lofty are still at Lofty now.
75. Thank you, I'll probably be making the change :)
76. I've met the current year 12s. The fact that she's had no issues is nothing short of a team effort divine intervention from the gods of every major religion.
77. 😭😭
78. Than
79. Previous Centenary student, my god it’s awful, the teachers watched on as SA happened, never took people seriously when they reported it. I know a girl that went to the head of year to report that a boy kept groping her daily and his response was “he’s just trying to be your friend, and doesn’t know how to go about it”, they were in year 10!! My sister transferred to lofty after being at centenary (graduated 2021) and she absolutely loved lofty. Such a positive experience for her.
80. i left because of bullying. not towards me, but towards a friend and i watched as no staff there did anything to stop/help it. i was a recent student at lofty and i can say its come a long way since what i heard before going there. it’s a lovely school!
81. that’s crazy, we would have most likely been there at the same time :)
82. You've got this! I hope you find your people :)
83. Oh my god, seriously? That's so fucking disgusting. I'll definitely be moving.
84. Irrespective, it's legal to record conversations in Queensland as a one party consent stage. Any politician who is afraid of being recorded should scuttle away like the little cockroach they are.
85. I haven't lived in Toowoomba for about 5 years, but when I did, he used to always be at the Spotted Cow, parking his van with his mug on the side of it out the front. I met him there a few times and it sounds like he is still just as much of a knob now as he was then
86. Queensland is a one party consent to recording state, and you shouldn’t state something you’re not willing to stand by IMO. If he’s willing to vote that way he should be willing to say it and have it be known. If he suffers at the polls, he should be willing to stand by it.
87. If you're in Qld its not illegal to record audio in your vicinity. It's illegal to play it back or distribute it as I understand it. I looked this up because when I moved to Qld I wanted to know what the legislation was for home security cameras. I've also had a Holter they aren't fun and look like a comedic "wearing a wire" joke from a tv show. I didn't read your points on abortion just letting you know the law.
88. Sounds like old mate went to the Jason Falinski School of How to Behave at Polling Stations.
89. This attitude about potential policy concerns is not acceptable from a public political figure and it's both bold and appropriate that you asked for this information. Of course, these are hot-button issues for some, but if you are afraid of being asked to justify your opinion/potential policy stance about this as a politician (i.e. in the event that previously unknown information about tone position becomes public), you need to ask yourself why you're afraid of that. How is it ethically acceptable for a politician to support limiting rights while being secretive about (or unable to give) rationale for it? I'm also angered by the attitude of some politicians who feel they are not obligated to answer questions about their stance on issues. To be blunt about it, who the fuck do they think they work for? (Yeah, we all know some are pretty much working for lobbyists, but you know what I mean)
90. Man that sounds pretty thin skinned. Surely he realises the LNP will be torn to absolute shreds in parliament with a Labor opposition. Will the embarrasment/trauma be worth it for a single term?
91. Ask him how he feels about the rapist Caleb Kirby serving 0 jail time next time.
92. Ah yes, an LNP candidate (and respective office) being well out of place and rude to voters, how surprising
93. Me taking a huge reel to reel tape recorder to David Crisfullis office and denying I’m recording him, it’s just I am on the way to the recording studio and stopped in for a chat.
94. What you experienced is commonly referred to as red flags
95. Thank you for sharing this incident. I always had a very negative gut feeling about Watts. You’ve now confirmed it.
96. Thank you fortaking the time to publish this. Everyone needs to know it. I hope you're well now.

99. Why would I want to call someone to complain about something that a random person on the internet said happened?
100. Ha ha ha, I saw him at the Newtown and he bought me a beer
101. Bro give up it’s so over Trevor’s seat is rusted on and the LNP will form government Signed, A disappointed but not surprised resident
102. Likely a fabricated lie from unreasonablebarber OP.
103. You sound like a male Karen. (Please note here I do no follow politics at all)
104. Well done to Trevor for getting returned 👏
105. [removed]
106. IANAL Afik in Qld you can record but not distribute without the participants permission. I *think* there is a provision regarding immediate danger or something along those lines.
107. There is laws about distribution though.
108. I think it’s 50% of the parties are in agreeance to it?
109. Its not legal to publish secretly made recordings though. They can only be used in very specific situations.
110. So he's not changed, knew him many years ago and he was a knob then too.
