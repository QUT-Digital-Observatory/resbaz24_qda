Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Tough on after crime :) fk all for before crime.
2. It’s social media which means that you know of every crime and potential crime in your suburb, and the algorithms love that shit because naturally you want to know if someone is checking doors or whatever. And the cameras are there to show it. The fact that 95% of the people who got robbed left their side door unlocked and their car keys on the kitchen table is the part that tends not to get shared, with apologies to the 5%.
3. Same in my neighbourhood, though 9 times out of 10 it is always the same kid. Or not even a kid at all, usually POS adults going around checking cars and houses, so it's still only a small drop in the bucket to brandish it as 'youth crime' from these pages, but yes, it does give the community a sense of crime being rife. But I think the thing that did it in tandem with this was that old cunt with the sob story about his daughter and unborn grandkids being run over by a youth out on bail, this ad was literally everywhere u could see or hear something. And this is the problem because 10000000000% that old cunt and his mowed down family don't even exist...
4. Sadly, the other potatohead isn’t much better. Time to move back to aotearoa?
5. ‘Gave us’ …you mean used our tax dollars to pay for this.
6. So basically he made inflation worse
7. state government has nothing to do with negative gearing and franking credits, so i'm not sure what your point is
8. When Labor have been in power at the state level, almost constantly, for 30 years, what does that say about the influence of the courier fail? It’s an irrelevant rag that survives on having a decent crossword. It’s not the power people think it is.
9. The reason many are doing it is they think it’s time for a change because they’ve been in there too long. You’re overthinking this one a bit. A bit of those might be there but it’s mainly ‘time for a change’.
10. How do you think the QLD state election will impact franking credits?
11. It’s called living within your means. Labor may be able to buy your vote but they’re paying for it with your grandchildren’s money.
12. *Boomers have entered the chat*
13. Ha. If only...
14. I really hope we do, but fear we don't.
15. Local Government is the redheaded step child of politics. The State Government is embedded in the Constitution, whereas local government exists because the State Government wants it to. To extend the metaphor, Local Government is the child the State had from a previous marriage. As you pointed out, the State Government has responsibility for a lot of essential services, which is why it is important.
16. Not so much landslide any more. Limping over the line
17. Funny. MAGA republicans say the same the thing about Donald Trump.
18. Crime rates are at their lowest levels ever if you check the stats. There had been a very recent up tick, but that's due to inflation/cost of living, which Labor is stemming with recent changes. All crime, not just youth, will increase once libs are in. Sure, they will make a couple of tough examples of youths that do the wrong thing, but I guarantee if they get in, statistically there will be an increase in crime.
19. Since you have to vote, why not take the effort to do it properly?
20. It’s chalk and cheese. Name one single thing that Crisafulli has ever done for any person or part of the community when he has been in a position to do so? E.g. he was the Townsville Deputy Mayor for two terms - can you find a verifiable example of anything good he did for everyday people? Not for businesses or mining corporations, just normal people trying to live and work in QLD. I tried to find one and there is nothing. I put it to the entire subreddit two weeks ago and no one could find a single verifiable thing. Can you?
21. Nope. I think he’s proven that. What he did for those kids at the museum with Debbie Kilroy proves that. So no and Crisafulli is demonstrably a piece of shit.
22. You disqualify yourself from being able to take a stance against domestic violence. You have either voted for, or will vote for a party with policies that will cause more of it.
23. Both of them are Australian, now fuck of with your racist bullshit. Dumb fucker can't even distinguish two very different and distinct countries and cultures.
24. Comments that are meant as hate speech will be removed immediately and users banned. https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy

26. Essentially, they make you PAY to use the ambulance unless an absolutely critically life-threatening emergency is the reason for the callout. So basically, unless the ambulance is LITERALLY the only way to keep you alive, fuck you pay me!
27. [deleted]
28. I never thought they weren’t but the ALP were going nowhere under AP and needed a kick in the pants and initially Miles looked like he was just the sacrificial lamb until it turned out he actually had substance.
29. Queensland politics. Every few years there's a landslide as they get rid of a hated government, just to vote them back in again a few years later thinking they have definitely changed.
30. Privatisations! You get a privatisation! Ambulances get a privatisation! Schools get a privatisation! Everyone gets a privatisation!!
31. LNP always gets a free ride. The same people who bitch and whinge about debt and deficits are the same people who will vote for the LNP thinking they’re better economic managers. I’m glad for once even the media is ripping into the LNP about this.
32. Especially when the election is probably just about over with all the pre-poll voting these days. Buyer regret could set in early this time around.
33. And in a media blackout. It should be illegal.
34. Wait what? Why the actual fuck is that a thing fuck I hate these cunts
35. And no surprise why: people will be jobless just before Christmas.
36. To be fair Labor also only released its costings today to I believe. The key difference being that Labor being in government released a budget back in June. Still they announced 9.7 billion in new spending not in that budget (according to the ABC). The LNP is cutting 6.8b currently being spent on consulting fees, so assuming that is correct would not be gutting public service jobs (just KPMG ones lol). Not sure how that would affect the public services ability to operate though.
37. Less than 24 hours because it was released when a media blackout started. Nobody saw it until after the election. Many people who postal or early voted for LNP also wanted to swap votes come election time but it was too late
38. Did you vote for that major constitutional amendment and advisory body despite not knowing how much it would cost? I guess any amount is easy to swallow after spending $450 million on it
39. I left the moment labour lost. The writing was on the wall. But fuck me my fellow kiwis are dumb. Thought Australians would be smarter.
40. True, but no extra money allocated to replace that expenditure. The LNP seems to have costed savings by not taking an option without costing the alternative option taken. "I've saved $1800 a day by not dining exclusively at Michelin star restaurants." Great, but you are still spending on food, right? Right? (You don't get to bank those savings regardless of whether you spent them or not.)
41. Trim or slash? There’s a difference. I hope people think VERY carefully what they’re voting for. This being Queensland, I’m not hopeful.
42. Perfect time for some spring cleaning
43. News media had originally suggested a landslide LNP victory was coming. Now they're saying they'll see a very tight LNP victory. Even traditionally pro Coalition media like Sky News have been ripping Crisafulli apart with how big a fuckwit he's been acting to journalists this past month.
44. I am a Queenslander 😀 This is mainly because regional and Gold Coast voters have gone conservative for some reason.
45. Imagine knowing a guy is discount Ron De Santis and still voting him in.
46. Yeah. You're spot on. Miles has been hamstrung from the get go. I never thought I'd say it. But the guy actually seems legit with being upfront. Not all smoke and mirrors.
47. The counter argument is the polling never shifted during the past ten months, so time as Premier wasn't a main factor. It's the election that's been the vehicle that has allowed Miles to lead a Labor resurgency, especially as the public only pay attention during the final two weeks of an election campaign.
48. But would having more time have helped him? I’m from NSW so haven’t been paying that close attention but every time I see him I get smug twat and barely competent vibes. The liberal guy on the other hand has child predator vibes so, miles seems the lesser of 2 evils.
49. The bipartisan committee for tackling youth crime fell apart earlier this year because one of their key recommendations was to implement regulations against political misinformation that demonised Queensland youths. All of the sudden when that was recommended the Opposition were no longer interested in cooperating on tackling youth crime. This is also about the time criminologists studying the matter that had become so politicised started noticing that youth crime is literally at the lowest point its ever been in the state's entire history and all the crime trends were coming from 30-39 year olds. The Coalition is only interested in tackling crime if they're allowed to mislead the public and manipulate them because it's the only way that they can convince people an issue exists.
50. My business colleague is 65. He is voting because of youth crime. He lives in a secure building in Hamilton. Never seen any crime. I told him youth crime is down over the last 20 years and showed him the data. He wouldn’t believe it as it was from the Government (agency operated by). I said who would you prefer to release the data? He said the Police. My wife yelled at him from the other room, “that’s the government you imbecile!” 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
51. Yes, every Gen Z worker of mine told me they voted LNP but also have no idea who Campbell was. Even the women I work with voted LNP knowing it could potentially effect our health care rights
52. Sunshine Coaster here. The LNP corflutes outnumber all the other candidates’ by 10-1. It’s crazy especially considering we’re a pretty conservative area.
53. I mean yeah, guilty as charged. I'm 30 and have voted since I was able to but it never seemed like such a dire choice. I always felt lucky that our elections felt "low stakes" compared to USA in that whoever wins, it's still just Australia and we'll be fine. Perhaps I was just younger and naive, and the issues that affect/move me now are different. I'm willing to accept I've been an ignorant voter for a long time, and that my initial comment might display my naivety. Always just went greens -> labour -> LNP because the environment has been my greatest political issue since I was young, and admittedly grew up in a pretty disadvantaged household so LNP never struck me as a party that gave a shit about my family. Now I'll be putting labour above greens to try and push the realistic option ahead of the obvious "villains" as I see them this cycle. Regardless, I definitely feel the stakes are pretty different this time around. Edit: In relation to my initial comment, I never felt any resentment for people voting in their best interests in the past, but this time around it feels like anyone who votes for LNP is just an asshole, straight up 😬
54. Yeah, they might. And I'm gonna resent half the state for it. Ignorant cunts everywhere.
55. I know how it sounds, that's why I said "I hate to say it", but in this case it's actually true. If you fall for this muppet's lies you're a fool.
56. Thankyou, it’s so hard to find any details, all I can find are short articles with a few bullets in
57. well you can. To say this hasn’t worked in other countries is a bit naive *cough* El Salvador for example. Extreme - absolutely.
58. It's always people too ignorant to actually do any research who think that all politicians are just as bad as each other...
59. no they were paid for by coal royalties
60. Well yeah, glad to see it being put to good use, there's only so many phoney carparks I'm willing to chip in for.
61. This is what taxes are for u literal shit stain. Making the country better for it's people. And this shit does. Dont tell me u like to pay more on ur power bill? Pay extra on ur car rego? Or did u just take that shit for granted and not think it affects u... I can guarantee 100% this really really helped someone u know, probably even someone real close
62. Haha ok mate
63. Did you know that all of these measures literally reduce inflation? It's pretty simple mathematically, it's the sum of costs in a previous period vs the current period. How much was your power bill this month/quarter, I bet you $1000 it was less than the previous quarter.
64. I said “and LNP in general”, as in at all levels of government
65. It is the power people think it is as part of Murdoch Media, but it takes generations to move past something as insane as Bjelke-Petersen and the Fitzgerald Inquiry. That's why Labor has been so empowered the past 3 decades ultimately.
66. Look at how Queenslander vote at the other two levels of government. Then look at what I said about a politician having to *really* fuck up to get bad press. Labor’s dominance at the state level is because the LNP has fucked up that bad
67. Exactly.. We've had the proven and sustainable growth party for too long. Time to give the wrecking ball and pollution party a go.
68. Where do you think they all got the same thought from? See point 1…
69. I said “and LNP in general” 😑
70. Didn't they deliver the largest budget surplus for any state or territory in Australian history? Then again, I wouldn't expect your average lnp voter to remember something that happened last week, much less last year. And the reason the boomer's grandkids can't afford a house until they have grandkids of their own is thanks to LNP at a federal level.
71. Ahhh you seem to have your parties mixed up bro. Bloody NPCs these days, you lot really gotta get your shit in order. Can't provide facts, can't provide policy can't even provide an explanation but yeah nah our grandchildren are paying for it. Go home your drunk
72. Well, millennials surpassed them for the largest voting group in 2021, so we can live in hope. Although experiencing the average intelligence/disinterest in politics of my generation, it's not much of a hope.
73. Boomer here. There’s no chance I’m voting for a party that will restrict women’s reproductive rights and refused to release its costing before the media blackout. Some of us actually have a soul.
74. Local government is more direct involvement with people though Development approval, buses, libraries, pot holes on your street, fluoride in your water, all these are the council's responsibility Yes there are over laps but for me I would hand policing and healthcare over to the federal government and delegate the rest to local councils The issue is there is a such a huge disconnect between governing the people in Brisbane vs someone in Roma. State government has out grown what it was created to achieve 120 years ago
75. Ah yes we've heard I'll vote for trump if he cracks down on youth crime so many times..
76. I wouldn't be doing it properly if I saw no difference between the candidates. Compulsory voting is wrong
77. I think bloke above forgot to put in a /s
78. There's also supposedly a hole in their budget they just released and mention of making cuts to public services so there's a very high chance of it happening again.
79. I think that QLD and TAS are the only states where using an ambulance is free. And the rest of the country probably wishes it was the same for them.
80. No, you're incorrect about that. Their plan was to keep code 1 and code 2 for the QAS.
81. Last time I got an ambulance was in SA and it was like $1500. That was like 7 years ago. They actually can't do anything if u don't pay or force u to pay and many people just don't.
82. I watched Steven Miles bench 100kg. Ain't no way he could be a bad leader, that man is built to carry Queensland.
83. So you've met my father.
84. Exactly. I believe once voting starts all costings should be available, policies viewable, ads/campaigning stopped. Let people sit with all the information and vote over the course of a week or two.
85. It did. Many people who voted early or postal voted for the LNP wanted to change, particularly when all the abortion stuff started hitting the media
86. You know why the government still relies so much on external consultants though, because Newman sacked a shit tonne of public servants back in his day, and we haven't been able to hire them back to keep getting the work done so have to pay triple the price to get the same work done. I would know, I'm working for a contractor who's doing so because it's an open market to exploit 🤷 if we don't someone else will. The issue if you cut all that is that there's no one and no money to actually pick up all that work, that's already not got enough staffing to get done so we will just go further backwards, into debt while also cutting funding to other important state government programs or initiatives. How anyone could actually vote for this waste of space wanker is beyond me. Miles is the first premier we've had in a long while who is a straight shooter and gets to the bloody point. Isn't pussy footing around the curly questions and has not only proven early on he can deliver fast and effective reforms and programs that benefit everyday queenalanders.
87. Labor has constantly kept its costings updated on its website with each pledge made. Unlike LNP with its campaign of slogans, not policies. At least Labor are upfront with their spending, and how in 3 years the books will be back in the black. Much of the borrowings will be going toward much needed long term infrastructure which is a good thing. Infra becomes an asset which outweights the cost of the debt. Borrowing money to provide tax cuts (as LNP will do with its plan to reduce mining royalties) reduces the ability of the state to pay back debt and provide for other needs, such as infra. Labor builds, LNP destroys. Look no further than NZ where the idiotic National Party (LNPs cousin) has destroyed the NZ economy by cancelling every infrastructure project, and borrowed billions to pay for unnecessary tax cuts. Their health system is also borked. LNP will follow the same pathway in QLD if elected.
88. 100%, true that costing were part of that for Labor. They also had tangible policies instead of vague ideas. The costings aren’t a surprise from the LNP. “Just make it something people won’t really understand and that we can fob off when questioned.”
89. The vote was to add recognition of, and ongoing formal role in policies and laws affecting Indigenous Australian to our constitution, not the specifics of it. This meant the government of the day could spend a lot or a little on it, but it had to exist. They weren’t hiding the cost, it didn’t exist yet. It’s telling that even now, you didn’t bother to try understand it.
90. Part of the reason consultancy spend is so high is due to the cuts they made 12 years ago to a lot of highly competent public servants who probably went to B4s and charged them 3-4x their then salaries as externals They've made verbal overtures into setting up an internal consultancy of some description, but meh, hopes are not high
91. The way u wrote those sounds like the NBN all over again 🤦
92. Not Christian but may God have mercy on us all in the next few weeks.
93. GC is wall to wall conservative or ‘independent’ if they don’t want the LNP stink on them.
94. They were all greens and now they are way too far left radicals. Labor becoming a mix of themselves and greens really
95. >Ron De Santis Who is that? >voting him in He hasn't been voted in. Do other Australian states not have the LNP?
96. I wonder whether the predicted landslide meant Miles was able to take the risk of being honest.
97. You should never judge a person's competency by what they look like. Love him or hate him Miles is an incredibly competent person. He has a phd, worked in the union movement, started his own business, and absolutely shot up the Labor party ranks. Miles was only voted into office in 2015. He was the environmental minister who developed our climate transition plan. He was health minister and deputy premier during covid, during his time in this role he led the decriminalisation of abortion.
98. The fact you're comparing "smug twat, barely competent " and "child predator" as two evils, rather than one slightly irritating and one evil, says a lot about you.
99. Queenslander Here. The state needs a shakeup. Youth crime maybe looked at as a small issue, due to lack of action it has impacted numerous people particularly in the regional centres ; 3 women killed by a 'youth' joy rider in a stolen car in my LGA. The govt reaction is to change the speed limit from 80 to 60km. Another woman was killed by a speeding driver doing over 160kms in a 60km zone. A night you can hear the cars speeding, you can see the rubber marks on the road, lack of action by govt to investigate and stop, until you count the special task force which arrived for 3 nights around 3 weeks ago. Govt unaction, resolved in the death of 4 woman in my LGA due to joy riders. A friend who owns a small business, the business has been break into like 5 times in the last 6 months - 10 x thousands in glass replacement, 10 x thousands in unsellable stock, and the last time they stole a packet of toilet paper. These offenders are released and re-offend. This is a single mother, due to this had to close her profitable (before the breakins) business. You can drive out of my regional town and see 3 burnt out cars and more write out cars (stolen cars, increases our insurance). A kid working to save up for a new scooter, it gets stolen (numerous stories every week). So youth crime is visibly higher in the regions.
100. Yeah, that's exactly the experience my wife had too. For the singular ALP and the single greens person there were at least 10 LNP DnD 10 ON people out the voting centre EDIT: 10 LNP and 10 ON people, not DnD
101. Clowns gonna clown
102. What have Labor done so well?
103. As least Crisafulli has held a job outside of politics. Are there any Labor politicians that have done that?
104. All from the same bucket that our tax goes into, so don’t be fooled, we pay for it one way or another.
105. Haha, clever buddy. Problem is I’m the one paying massive amounts of tax to supplement dole bludgers like you. It’s me paying your power bill and rego. So yeah, you’re welcome.
106. Our bill jumped up and extra $200 this quarter and we have used it way less than the last one. Last quarter heater was pumped heaps. Didn't get much use this quarter. Next quarter AC will be cranked 🤷 Still a far cry from the bills we had in SA but they are still jumping up
107. Causes property prices to go up tho as people spend more $
108. I’m old enough to have experienced life under Joh, Qld is vastly, and I mean vastly, different. The CM has greatly diminished in its influence. Those of us either in the unions or with the ALP hardly even consider it anymore.
109. And Newman just reinforced that, by reminding us of the worst excesses of the conservatives here. Borbidge was never popular enough to hold on, and Springborg toiled but was never going to overcome that as a National. The LNPs problem is that QLD Labor has quite a few tendencies they would agree with normally, but can't because Labor bad, and in order to oppose them, they have to go further. The irony of the nominally centre left party drifting slightly right of centre being bad for the nominally centre right one is that the LNP achieves a lot of what it should want to do by having Labor elected... Except for winning elections.
110. Yeah what the fuck are we thinking. Burn and destroy.
111. I think it came from the Fitzgerald Inquiry history more so than Murdoch’s papers. People saw how corrupt JBP’s government became et such a long period and they have long memories. The unfortunate part is that while long service can corrupt, that doesn’t necessarily mean it will. In this case, it hasn’t.
