Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Whatever bro you can think you're modest and balanced by haggling others for expressing their opinion on the basis of that's how democracy works and they should suck it up. You're really open-minded. You're not arrogant at all for refusing to do a modicum of research about either party yet invalidating how others react to an election result.
2. Low IQ generation is not abusive? My generation was the activist generation of Vietnam moratoriums and the Whitlam government. We thought we were changing the world. We got done over by the sweep of global neoliberalism from the likes of Hawke and Keating and then the abysmal Howard. And too many were persuaded to vote against their own interests and believed the propaganda. What makes you think your generation won't go the same way? It's easy to think your whole generation is like the people you associate with, but they aren't. Your generation will just as easily produce the rulers of the world and the exploiting capitalist class as did mine. But hey, hold onto your idealism and resist. I have, as have many, though not enough, of my generation.
3. There you go again, generalising. I don’t know which particular ‘generation’ you consider yourself, but I certainly wouldn’t generalise about it, nor judge the entire cohort by someone like, say, you.
4. *brains' development maybe if you valued the arts a bit more in your education you wouldn't me making schoolboy spelling errors all the time. lol
5. No one is making policy based on whether you are a boomer or not. This is cringe.
6. But boomers like me have children in their 40’s! Left home years ago and have their own opinions. If there are parents out there parroting Murdoch talking points, they’re very unlikely to be boomers. We’re grandparents now. Like I say, demographically and historically, we boomers, along with other cohorts, have elected ALP Qld governments for nearly a decade. Suddenly, the electorate chucks them out, and it’s the boomers fault😂😂 The only difference I can see is that there are fewer boomers and more younger voters. Now the LNP are in power. Go figure.
7. Well I'm not a boomer so can't speak for them but I can say that Gen Z is going to do the most damage of any generation thus far in human history. It's the sheer numbers. You write: >What I’m blaming them for, is when they turned 40 and got involved in politics RATHER than make policies to ensure the NEXT generation ALSO are born into favourable economic position they kept making policies that ONLY served their generation and people with established wealth.. Fair eonough. But gen Z will have to have a lower quality of life than previous generations. It is the sheer numbers. I mean do the mathematics: where do you think wealth comes from? Ultimately it stems from the capacity to grow things and make things and sell those things and, in Australia, space for people to live. These are reaching their biological and physical limits and we are facing the first generations of humans for whom there are hard limits on growth. So my advice is to get used to substantially limited prospects. We will never again see the *lebensraum* and the capital acquisition that typified Boomer and Gen X populations, at least not until populations contrasct and reach a sustainable steady state. Even then these generations will need to rethink an alternative to endless growth. It will get worse for you and your following generations as refugee populations clamour at Australia's border and food production *decreases* when climate change really starts to bite. So: don't breed, forgo owning a car, live in a small apartment, don't eat meat or be as guilty as the Boomers you are currently reviling. The species can't expand forever. You are the first modern generation to reach these hard limits. Sorry to hand out these facts dude but ther eis no point blaming Boomers - your generation is going to hav eto muddle through with declining resources and a greater population. The time where every working Australian has a mcMansion in the suburbs with 4 kids, a Dodge Ram on the straeet, a boat in the garage and a Beefmaster BBQ in the back yard is fucking over, my friend. Hard times lie ahead.
8. And they'll get screwed a lot worse under LNP.
9. It's messed up that I could tell how you voted based on this alone.
10. But it's not $1.90 a week. It's one big bill every 6 months where these people may have no savings and have to choose between short paying rent or delaying rego driving unregistered. These things matter. 100% there's bigger issues. Are you saying if there are bigger issues we shouldn't reduce people's costs of living because they don't deserve it because they are poor?
11. /s ^ you dropped something friend 😉
12. I'm not suggesting this should be part of a broad policy, but the judiciary should be given tools to handle cases like this. I always hear that mandatory minimum sentences and 3 strike rules remove the ability for a judge to use discretion and judgement, which i agree with, but you never hear any arguments against maximum sentences. This case, in particular, is a clear scenario where that thug deserved to spend most of his adult life imprisoned, yet because of the laws, he will be released before he is 30 and his criminal record will be sealed due to being a minor at the time of his offence. The judge himself said he would give a harsher sentence if he could.
13. Firstly, you're wrong about the maximum sentence. The maximum sentence in QLD for murder is life with the minimum period of 15 years before being eligible for parole, which can be 20 or 25 years depending on the nature of the offence. Considering the nature of the murder and total lack of remorse expressed when he was arrested, there is a high likelihood of the harsher non parole eligibility period being imposed. So the maximum he will serve is equal the the minimum amount an adult will serve, he will also likely get parole after 8 years, 8 years of his life vs the entire life of Emma Lovell's husband and children. 8 years means he will only be 25 when he's likely released. Secondly, there is no history violence at all, apart from 16 home invasions, which included 2 where the occupants were home. Home invasion is a violent act no matter how you want to spin it. The rest is a sob story, and while I have sympathy for what he endured in life, it is no excuse for his actions. I dont get why you're so desperate to simp for this thug. Do you have any empathy at all for the Lovell family, or is all your empathy saved for the violent offenders?
14. I don't disagree with any of the prescriptions above. However are there any valid examples where massive investment has brought general societal uplift in socioeconomically disadvantaged locales as you have mentioned? The problem with gang life is once you're in its difficult to escape, and general societal slump takes generations to uplift.. if ever. The bucket of crabs analogy seems to apply here. There are cases where one of two people manage to bootstrap themselves outta there. But how regularly does this happen. I don't know man.. I want the best for people but they have to not only want it but be willing to put effort into obtaining it.. the value of something received for nothing.. is usually nothing.
15. Bit of a no-win situation, sad the society behind it seems to be collapsing so much so that these kids are safer in a rough as fook detention centre than not. But aside from massive societal change what can be done? Unlikely building a few basketball courts would help. If anything would serve as localised gang territories, judging by similar efforts in NYC and la. Which the kids no doubt model themselves after?
16. They do something half assed without any real plan, wasting millions, and no doubt paying their own mates to do the work so they get a kickback. They do nothing about public transport (which is terrible all throughout the state), they do nothing to support people through one of the worst housing crises we've ever experienced, they do nothing that would actually benefit the public. What useless projects they do undertake are always carried out in the least efficient manner possible, throwing away millions that would better serve the public good (like our healthcare system that's about ready to implode). They've been at this for a decade now, and all they can say for themselves is that they at least started the Bridgewater bridge, and pat themselves on the back for adding some beds to one of the state's hospitals. Meanwhile most of the general public can barely even read and write, and if you need to see a doctor you can be waiting weeks. That's not a party I want in control of my government.
17. People like you make me sick.
18. In my personal view, it was based on the very real risk of allowing organised religion to influence social policy - which is well documented to infringe on personal autonomy. The LNP has frequently made amendments, and/or proposed legislation to discriminate based on personal beliefs. In one such instance, they amended the marriage Act to only allow opposite genders to marry. edit: to answer your initial question, the proposal impacted them enough to consider it an attack on them
19. I wasn’t saying it wasn’t the case now. I’m saying it isn’t a ‘minor issue’ for the government to allow doctors to pick and choose who, or what they treat. That adoration has been politicised so successfully by evangelical shirt heads a free decades ago is only out done buy people in 2024 still ceding to their propaganda
20. The simple answer is it doesn't matter if you don't put in the work and convince voters. They convinced Brisbane but failed to convince the rest of the state. The fact they put CFMEU into administration fucked them hard considering how unionised these areas are. No one will reward a party who betrays them like that.
21. I think maybe a remedial english class
22. "obstinate or unreasonable attachment to a belief, opinion, or faction, in particular prejudice against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular group." Pretty much any QLD sub.... you're welcome.
23. Yeah you're right, when the debt in QLD skyrockets there will be crickets from Newscorp about it. But fuck Victoria for actually building infrastructure and improving the lives of their citizens.
24. I am forced to review it every day I’m at work mate, crime map is no replacement for being out on the streets and dealing with the reality of the situation.
25. And assault victims feel fine, I'm sure.
26. There has been a downward trend in crime in the last year, that’s it. Saying “crime is going down” is just as a useless slogan as the LNP uses. It has no basis in reality. All Crime has slightly trended downward last year across Qld, but this includes minor crimes and non violent. The statistics clearly show that violent and serious offending, especially among youth, has increased a lot and is on an upward trend. These are the facts. So saying “crime is going down” while being a blanket statement is true, it’s not real. Actual crimes that are serious, violent and affect people are rising. This is why Labor did not try and push the narrative that crime is going down.
27. 🤡
28. I'm no big fan of the media, they generally have a bias one way or another no matter what they tell you, and that very specifically applies to both sides, not just the right. The problem I'd that's very hard to remove, but you have to have a media to inform people of policy plans. Your original point though, was to denigrate everyone that voted in a way you didn't like. Have a go at the media, fine, but that's not what you were doing.
29. *pats back* that's nice buuuuudy.
30. The facts show it was one great wealth transfer event. We are still paying for it.
31. Listen lady, you seem quite upset. Maybe go for a walk or something to take your mind off things
32. Well, you said it. I'm just telling you how do you think you get dictatorial control?
33. Hahahahaha. That's funny.
34. I already said it was good? But its not enough
35. And you can continue to think that claiming the majority of your fellow Queenslanders are too stupid to vote in their best interests is a balanced and open minded view to have Whatever helps you feel better about yourself I guess Xx
36. Don't worry mate, not everyone our age thinks like this high IQ player. Anyone who stands with progessive change is an ally. You've been that ally since before I was born, and I'd be happy to keep you with us. Class consciousness is what we need, not stereotyping.
37. I wouldn’t say so because a) [it’s factual](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200803092125.htm) and relevant to discussion & b) it answers confused Qlders questions on how this occurs. Factually a LOT of your generation didn’t finish primary school and factually have low IQs. There’s other reasons you score so low on iq tests though, as almost every Boomer [has clinical concerning blood lead levels, resulting in decreased IQ levels](https://www.acsh.org/news/2022/03/10/commentary-lead-and-iq-16174) Fun fact your generation actually [scores lower on cognition tests than the generations before](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200803092125.htm) or after you did. It’s truly an accomplishment in complete idiocy.
38. Dude you're not doing yourself any favours by ridiculing someone for incorrect apostrophe use "spelling errors" when you go ahead and make a typo in that same reply. Everyone makes mistakes, why so condescending? Quote "*brains' development maybe if you valued the arts a bit more in your education you wouldn't me making schoolboy spelling errors all the time. lol"
39. You are quite thick aren’t you? You don’t need to explicitly state “boomer” in a policy for the primary stakeholders and beneficiary of said policy to become boomers. You write policies that are favourable for the class of asset rich individuals that further the gap between them and the young people entering the market with nothing. Whereas when boomers were kids policies would be written to benefit the asset and money poor youth and not the asset rich Golden or silent generations that preceeded the boomers
40. Shhh. Stop using logic. It confuses them young folk. (And yes in case it isn’t obvious I’m deliberately being ironic by using my own generalisation).
41. I'm saying there's bigger issues for the poor.
42. So 20/30/40/50 years in prison? Life in prison? What tool to address it? Hang them? Something went wrong with our society long before the 75th conviction. It takes a village to raise a child but if we don’t nurture them and support them to not get to this point we just lock em up forever?
43. I’m not simping for him. And I took the 70 percent from the article. This all started because I said I want societal constructs to stop kids getting to this point in the system. Libs policy and this example got brought up in rebuttal that harsher penalties are the real solution. Hardly simping for someone I heard of 3 hours ago. We as a society failed this kid to the point someone died. We are responsible for this situation and the answer isn’t just bigger jail time. I’m more open to the parents copping the penalty than saying a kid in an abusive situation who made a series of horrible choices AS A KID is the example that can be used to say youth crime needs harder punishments. I don’t want to talk about huge punishments if it’s before every possible aspect of improving these situations happens. Punishments aren’t a deterrent. You think some dumb kid is thinking about potential charges when doing something that’s already irrational.
44. Absolutely, yes. If you look at the stats, violent crime in general has been trending downward for decades, not just in our country, but every western country, as our standards of living have increased. Increased living standards are the direct result of everything I listed above. The reason the LNP are so bad is because their policies are regressive. They cut social programs and economic stimulus that directly reduced crime. Social unrest is 100% born from reduced living standards. Any kind of backslide contributes to this. There was an uptick in crime in 2008, and in the covid years. There's a reason for that. And yeah, I'm not saying investing in a troubled community is going to turn everyone into a saint. This is a long term project. Even so, people act on their best interests and are prosocial by nature. When they are provided for, they are more productive, educated and forward thinking. No one is content and happy living off centrelink. No one wants to get shot selling dimebags on the street. It's miserable. If there is a safety net where one person gains the system while 100 people get what they need to become good citizens, that's worth doing. People focus too much on what people "deserve" instead of what actually works. The war of drugs is perfect example. Drug use is seen as immoral, even though outlawing it is exactly what leads to substance abuse and organised crime. Immoral systems produce immoral people.
45. Thanks to libs you can actually have a career in Tasmania doing something other than trades, low skilled jobs or public service.
46. People like me are a very big part of the silent majority, so I hope you enjoy regular bouts of sickness.
47. >to answer your initial question, the proposal impacted them enough to consider it an attack on them Was it the actual proposal or the scare campaign that abortion would be made illegal? Even when abortion was technically illegal, we still had 14000 abortions performed every year. At no time during this period where abortion was illegal did anyone attempt to apoint judges who would enforce this law, or DPP solicitors/barristers who would prosecute people under that law or even a police commissioner who would investigate and charge people for even one of these 14000 abortions. To think that they are going to change the law now after they had the law on their side and chose not to enforce it is nonsensical.
48. Then, the changes proposed by KAP aren't all that extreme then. If you want to argue that conscience objection shouldn't be allowed, then that's fine, but the topic was "are the changes proposed by KAP extreme," and to me, they are relatively minor.
49. You’re right on that point actually
50. Unreasonable attachment? Interesting. I think there’s very valid reason. Secondly, I’ve never voted ALP in my life prior to last night. Wrong again, buddy. Prejudice against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular group…it’s got nothing to do with them being members of a particular group but rather voting against issues that will support Queensland as a whole or voting for ones that work against us.
51. I mean it is pretty smart really, Victorian government runs up the debt, the nation will have to bear the costs in the end. You can’t run deficits forever, that’s how your currency becomes toilet paper. Best of luck to all
52. oh true, that's why anecdotes are held in such high regard compared to hard data
53. that wouldn't be car theft then, would it?
54. So you agree crime is going down? INCLUDES minor crimes and minor crimes, you didn't say it excluded violent crimes. What are your sources for an upward trend of violent crimes? The government can only make the line go down, and they have. They can't put an end to crime. If they SOMEHOW could, laws would be redundant. People choosing to commit crimes is not the governments doing.
55. Thank you 👍
56. By completely overthrowing the government and implementing a new system with no checks and balances of power.
57. "No, I wanted a Ferrari, not a Lambo"
58. Maybe it's less stupidity and more a combination of laziness and ignorance. Civic duty encompasses more than just voting, it's doing research.
59. More generalisations. You are the master of them.
60. > why so condescending? this you champ? > See you’re thinking of the arts majors I’m more thinking of the real degrees in STEM fields sounds pretty condescending to me. maybe if you did an arts degree you'd be able to recognise how embarrassingly hypocritical you are :) lol
61. Your entire explanation just confirms my whole point that it's about class interests, not generational ones, lol. The state's ideology dictates economic policy and their relationship with organised labour. There is constant tension between capitalist interests, democratic institutions and populism. The boomers enjoyed a strong resurgence in economic populism, something that was vehemently opposed by the elites at that time, as well. Whitlam gave us free healthcare, he was susequently sacked. People were more class conscious back then, but their understanding of politics is as dumb then as it is now. That includes our generation, too. The erosion of the welfare state, wages and worker's rights began long before we were born. Boomers are not the problem. Our democracy being usurped by rich oligarchs is the problem. Your boomer hate make enemies of many potential allies. You aren't helping anything by dismissing them.
62. They are poor from lack of money. I believe taking less of their money away makes them less poor no. Being poor doesn't make them stupid, there's literally wealthy people out there who want control over random women's bodies because 'jesus' wouldn't like it. We've got idiots on all ends of the financial spectrum
63. I don't disagree. Something absolutely should have been done before the 76th offence, but that doesn't bode well for the youth justice system that allowed this kid to continue to engage in increasingly more violent offences up until this point. If he did this same offence a few months later, he would have got 30 years. A violent murderer at age 17 shouldn't be getting special treatment he wouldn't be entitled to if he was a mere few months older. So yes, the system failed the Lovell family here, and the last thing they could have done was at least provide a level of punishment appropriate to the severity of the offence.
64. Yes, I'm sure the family of Emma Lovell would love to hear that it's everyone's fault because no one loved and supported this poor, hard done by kid. He killed someone. While out on bail for other violent crimes. He's had enough chances.
65. >I’m not simping for him. And I took the 70 percent from the article. That means you're reading an article with an agenda. His maximum sentence is equal to the minimum non-parole period. He wasn't a kid either. A 17yo boy is able to get a car license and is mere months away from becoming legally an adult. He was strong enough to overpower a 40yo woman and her husband and inflict a lethal stab wound. I also keep hearing that punishments aren't a deterent. Tell me, do you have kids? Do you ever take away toys or electronics if your child is misbehaving? Punishments aren't a deterent is just as reductive as saying hard prison time will straighten out a kid who steals a car. I'm in no way suggesting we go down the Singapore route of public floggings, but Singapore has one of the lowest crime rates in the world so harsh punishments clearly have some impact. I'm hopeful that the new YDCs in Capricornia and Cairns will have a positive impact on kids before they get to this point. It's not anything like a prison, it's much closer to a boarding school. If they existed in 2019 when this kid started offending, maybe he wouldn't have gone down the path he went. But they didn't, and he went down the path he did, so he needs to pay his debt to society. I dont think letting him walk free at age 25 is him paying his debt to society.
66. Everything is a cycle.. let's hope the next cycle brings more up than down. Because looking at history, when a society reaches this state normally. The solution is often simply war.
67. Thanks to the libs, most Tasmanians are barred from further formal education and job opportunities because they can't read or write.
68. You had better hope that capitalism doesn’t fail.
69. I'm unsure if you're a bloke, but we hold a particular privilege in this area in that it doesn't affect us. We can hypothesise, and disagree with each other, ultimately no matter which way the penny drops it largely doesn't affect us. The fact that it was even brought up was enough for women to feel threatened, and I will stand with them for that reason alone, regardless of whether or not it was just a "scare" tactic as is claimed. I'm going to agree to disagree and discontinue our dialogue. Thanks for sharing your view
70. Hell of a bar to set to get to people being able to dictate their religious requirements to others to be a ‘minor policy’. Personally I think people should be free to get the medical treatments they need and not have someone else’s religion factor in it at all.
71. The data isn’t very reliable with the crime map, I wouldn’t call it hard data. It’s best estimate. A lot of attempted breaks don’t get reported as such unless an attempt was made to the extent where the owner agrees they want to make a complaint, which a lot of the time unless the owner has had something damaged they would rather it just be noted on the system. But depending on the officer that “noted on the system” could be something as simple as a street check, which wouldn’t be represented accurately in crime map data.
