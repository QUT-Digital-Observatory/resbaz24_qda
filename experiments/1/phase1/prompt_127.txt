Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. ok I was unclear: you are not employable. I believe in the transcendent value of human life and that every person deserves dignity and their minimum needs met. as for not being empathetic, buddy, I've been there. I have clawed my way back from being homeless, more than once. the lesson I learned is to be valuable to others. the public service in QLD, in its current form, is essentially a welfare kindergarten for adult babies that need their dogshit degrees de-risked. again, if the only thing stopping you from being unemployed is the government seal on your payslip: your job is bullshit. you know the worst thing about Crisafulli's government? it WON'T be newman 2.0, because that's what we actually need x2, electric boogaloo. the service is now so bloated, increasing above population growth, and crossing so many palms, that taking the hacksaw to it is politically impossible. the electorate is now both the dealer and the addict because of how many hundreds of thousands are employed in the public service, and we will never be able reduce our using.
2. There are a lot to go around ü§£
3. This just in, facts are now edgy
4. People who read events with that kind of good faith are already on our side, they don‚Äôt need a rally to be convinced. The people who are going to dismiss preemptive rallies and protests are the Murdoch Media and people who believe the Murdoch Media. They‚Äôre going to be critical enough of these protests when it‚Äôs in response to actual legislation, we don‚Äôt need to make their jobs easier by protesting against a shadow. Whatever broad strokes we know of so far are not legislation. It‚Äôs nothing concrete. Showing their hand, in this instance, is an actual bill. They already know the general sentiment on our side about abortion. We aren‚Äôt telling them anything new with a show of solidarity over a general position they and everyone else are already aware of. When there are actual measures on the table, that‚Äôs when we have something to protest against.
5. Your response shows you are a ‚Äúsalty hysterical chicken little‚Äù
6. Have you seen how many smoke shops are around? Bike gangs are going well.
7. So no example worthy of hyperbole? What makes me feel less worried is that last time they did a bunch of shit things, but we voted them out in a single term. So I‚Äôm confident that if history repeats itself it will in the next election too. However, if they‚Äôre more moderate, then we don‚Äôt have as much to worry about
8. Which healthcare did labor criminalise?
9. Please, how many late term abortions were performed prior to 2018 and how many have been performed since? And how many were of healthy pregnancies? Please post evidence that every late term abortion was performed on a non healthy and non viable pregnancy and I will gladly admit that those terminations would have been allowed to occur even under the old laws. If there are no abortions of healthy and viable late term pregnancies, then why is the pro-abortion lobby so against putting safeguards in place? I'll wait for you to provide that proof, by the way.
10. [removed]
11. That literally says net debt is forecast to increase due to decreased resources royalties & infrastructure projects. Despite net debt being "only" $24 billion, the state is paying interest on the entire $132 billion, and that's set to increase. They can't liquidate every asset to pay it off. Nothing has been misrepresented except your claim that the state's debt is fractional to what it really is.
12. There are different types of cautions: those given by police, and those given by the courts. I‚Äôm saying that rape committed by child offenders can and is given a caution by police. Perhaps I should have specified that I was talking about police cautions in my first comment. Under the legislation, police must consider cautioning child offenders before sending them to court. Certainly there are a number of circumstances that must be considered before a police caution is given, but it certainly happens. Thus, the rape case never sees the inside of a court room.
13. Ah mate, I couldn't agree more. This whole dogmatic/tribalism is sending us all backwards. I do agree that the national LNP is veering towards Republican/Semi-Evangelical level, which I personally can't get on board with. I do like Albo as a figured head, he seems really likeable. The association with the Greens party makes me uneasy, especially their proposed tax unrealised captial gains in superannuation. But it appears he's distanced himself from that bill. The emotion attached is crazy. I really don't know how the mantra of some people saying "you're either with us or against us" is healthy. I guess I've circled back to my original message that got lost amongst the anger. We're all in this state together. Let's stop the nastiness and try to get along.
14. So I'm being hyperbolic because I take people's concerns about losing their job seriously? When the LNP have a history of doing exactly that?
15. Simple and concise even you can understand it.
16. Policing and justice isn‚Äôt or shouldn‚Äôt be about retribution. Not with kids. When a child offends, it‚Äôs the governments fault. Government needs to step in and provide proper mental health, familial, and environment rehabilitation.
17. The same kids are spending more time in watch houses. Bail unmade, their parents aren‚Äôt interested, some are homeless. What do they have but criminal lifestyle? What help can they get- education, support, therapy for conduct issues?
18. In context, if it was necessary, I am in favour of mass protests. In the event that the people aren't heard then riots would be the next step. Unfortunately there are people who take it too far. I'm not in favour of that, but you shouldn't need that explained to you like you're a preschooler, because I didn't say that.
19. Whatever mate. It just boils down to ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I need it so it‚Äôs a waste of money‚Äù so slash public services until the system collapses. Again we tried the LNP and the fucked them selves straight back out of power.
20. A lot of weird fetishes? With the LNP's track record of producing rapey cunts I'm not surprised.
21. What like building infrastructure? For his faults (being the wrong team for th3 socialists) he managed to borrow and build airportlink tunnels. He also, magnamounously I believe , changed the law in Queensland to ALLOW the labor party to not lose party status in Queensland b3caus3 th3y jad so few seats they were not legally a party anymore, that gave them hug3 funding that they would have lost. It's easy f4om the cheap seats but that last point allowed labor to come back and mount a credible challenge, and he couldv3 gone nah fuck em. So that's a plus from my perspective for d3mocracy even if there's nothing I can see labor did in their small target strategy in 10 years that was long lasting and in the publics interest.
22. What healthcare is being criminalised?
23. Babies being born alive and left to die, is that the one you meant? Or assisted dying? Or did you read your beliefs in the guardian?
24. ‚ÄòSouth Australia is one of the only states to collect and publish their abortion data; over 90% of abortions in that state occur in the first trimester each year, with less than 2% occuring after 20 weeks gestation. The majority of post-20 week procedures are provided for fetal reasons.‚Äô https://www.preventivehealth.sa.gov.au/assets/downloads/abortion-reporting/SA-Abortion-Reporting-Committee-Annual-Report-2023_FINAL.pdf It‚Äôs all available to you. What you call ‚Äòsafeguards‚Äô are about removing the priority to the living breathing mother and placing it on the fetus. This is unacceptable. This places a risk to the mother, if clinicians have to assess their treatment against legislation before assisting their patient. It also means that if there is a change in the woman‚Äôs life, she is not free to control her body. It would be forced incubation. Why are you so desperate to control women‚Äôs bodies?
25. Says the coward hiding behind a burner account.
26. "*Nothing has been misrepresented except your claim that the state's debt is fractional to what it really is*." Its directly from the most credible source if you dislike that, I can't help you there unfortunately as Its data directly from QLD treasury and published by the Audit office. "*That literally says net debt is forecast to increase due to decreased resources royalties & infrastructure projects.*" Sounds like a simple fix then, Start increasing royalties on Mining and Gas extraction, Its not like they are going to leave as We have the resources they want.
27. Except they're rarely done by courts because of the conditions and definitely NOT for rape - As they are reserved for minor offences or non-violent offences. A rape may be considered by the court to be 'non-violent' in certain situations, but it is *never* a minor offence. Rape is a crime that *must* go to court. Simple as that. It's not a minor offence. It's an indictable offence. You can't just be charged by Police with an indictable offence and then cautioned by Police. It does not happen for rape. An accusation of rape *must* be investigated by Police and then if Police find enough evidence to charge the accused then it *must* go to court. If Police do not find enough evidence to support a charge, then they would not issue a caution. Because the youth would have to accept the caution and if there is no evidence to support a charge... then why would they admit to the offence (Which is required for a Police caution for youth). A caution is *not* an option for a serious indictable offence such as rape. Even if it's just a 'consent issue'. You don't know what you're talking about. Then you even tried to shift the goal posts to hide that, and were still incorrect. Edit: I am still waiting for you to cite the cases where this occurred. You said it happens with a definite 100%, so you must know *one* at the very least. I've tried searching for one and no luck so far.
28. People have the right to express their views, they don‚Äôt however have the right for their views to become government policy and they certainly don‚Äôt have the right to riot when the people they didn‚Äôt vote for win a free and fair election and implement their policy platform. I‚Äôm sure you didn‚Äôt need me to explain that to you like a preschooler either.
29. if I don't need something then it is by definition a waste of money. do you hear yourself?
30. More tears??
31. Well our new premier and his deputy voted in 2018 that abortion should be part of the criminal code. So good chance that one
32. What children are you referring to that are ‚Äòborn live and left to die‚Äô? Are you referring to the minuscule number of infants born who are unable to survive? Doctors can‚Äôt wave a wand and make sure every infant lives.
33. The majority is not all. I'm glad you admit that not all of them are done on non healthy, non viable pregnancies, as I said, and you said the opposite. So it is established that late term abortions of healthy and viable pregnancies are taking place. If you are OK with late term abortions of healthy viable pregnancies, then just say it, don't keep lying that they don't happen.
34. You misunderstand, and perhaps I haven‚Äôt adequately explained my position. Police take a complaint (for example, rape), they investigate, and they decide if there‚Äôs enough evidence to proceed with the charge. When dealing with child offenders, police have the option to issue a police caution instead of initiating court proceedings. There are many factors to consider when police issue a caution, and amongst them (as you said) the caution must be accepted by the child offender, and the child offender must make admission to the crime (or at least not deny it). If the child offender accepts the caution, it is given by the police, and the matter does not go to court. Police caution is not specific to rape, but can be given for all offences committed by a child offender except attempted murder and murder (as stated by OP). I cannot cite cases because these matters do not go to court, thus there is no public case available for you to look up. Source (since you are hellbent that I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about): am a police officer, worked in Child Investigation and Protection Unit, and am currently a police prosecutor. ETA: I should clarify that for police to issue a caution for rape, there needs to be appropriate authorisation given by higher-ups. The investigating officer doesn‚Äôt just decide willynilly to caution for a rape.
35. You have an extreme way of completely missing the point. People absolutely have the right to be heard. The government is meant to represent the people and it increasingly is representing it's own business interests. How else are the people supposed to hold their elected officials accountable when they're in government screwing the people over for years at a time backed by murdoch media? The people have a right to protest. If it comes to it, they have a right to protest - the French certainly had a right to riot. I'm not going to write you a 100 page thesis on the the acceptable times to riot, but it's not over 50 cent fares going up, so keep your hair on. You seem to want to be reductionist to the brink of absurdity. You're not trying to put an ounce of thought into what I might be saying here, and as I said, because this is reddit and not academia, I'm not going to spell it out for you, this isn't my dissertation. If you can't stretch your imagination beyond what seems to be some minor backyard issue and extrapolate it to wider more important issues then meh.
36. You. Are not. The entirety of the state. And your rant screams of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand these functions or the people who do them so slash slash slash‚Äù
37. Oh, abortion. You said healthcare. Why speak in euphemisms?
38. I'm referring to this is a nothing protest by useful idiots. If it was a protest foe what you say, then go for it, but don't sully the pond with claims someone is trying to "stop" something when it's waaaay more nuanced.
39. Your phrase ‚Äòlate term abortion* of healthy viable pregnancies‚Äô allows no room for consideration of the health of the mother. They‚Äôre living humans, not rocks, to use your words. So again, why are you so desperate to control women‚Äôs bodies? *not a real medical term
40. I understand. I'm telling you that you're wrong. Youth who are issued a caution have to admit to the crime in order to receive the caution (That's kind of the whole deal... it has to be accepted). If a child admits to rape, they don't get cautioned, they get formally charged. You can't compel or coerce someone to admit to a crime... that's really illegal! They don't go "Look, if you admit to the rape... we'll caution you." <--- That's illegal... extremely so. The youth has to admit to the crime during the investigation, and then they can offer a caution... which they can't do for rape as it is an indictable offence. Cautions can not be given for indictable offences. The fact you think Police are coercing confessions out of children and giving them cautions for serious indictable offences is absurd. Rapists, especially youth rapists, are not typically a 'one and done'. A child who commits rape is not typically an innocent little sunflower, any court case (for any crime) would include that they've been cautioned for rape... which makes it searchable. So far, can't find any! Edit: Holy shit. Skipped the part where you claim you're a Police officer and just saw it now. Are you seriously admitting that you're a Police Officer who engages in coercion? Also, apparently a Police Prosecutor who knows jack shit.
41. The people have been heard. And they overwhelmingly voted for the LNP. In your utopia the only people who deserve to be heard are the ones that agree with you. Otherwise it‚Äôs ok to riot. And you‚Äôre getting upvoted for it. Yep, cause that‚Äôs the modern democracy that we want, bunch of childish brats who have a tantrum when they don‚Äôt get their own way.
42. You brought up the ‚Äòright to riot‚Äô not me. So without writing a 100 page thesis, what are some issues you think the people of Qld would be within their rights to riot about?
43. I understand the public service all too well. I am literally a shadow ministerial staffer in the relevant portfolio. it is my entire job to ask pointed questions of the government about the public service, and uncover public service waste. holy shit please stop talking
44. Because abortion is healthcare and if you don‚Äôt know that maybe you need to learn a bit more to better inform yourself? If doctors have to question the legality of their healthcare procedures due to laws shifting the priority from the living humans to the fetus, it creates additional risks to both mother and child.
45. It's defined as 22+1. >healthy viable pregnancies‚Äô allows no room for consideration of the health of the mother That is what healthy pregnancy means. The opposite is where the mother is at abnormal risk of severe morbidity or mortality were the pregnancy to continue. You have to obfuscate because you can't admit that aborting healthy and viable pregnancies is wrong, but you also won't outright say you support it. It's got nothing to do with controlling women's bodies. If they would birth the child alive and give it up for adoption instead of killing it, then it wouldn't make any difference to them. There is minimal procedural difference between late term abortions and childbirth, other than the intent behind them.
46. Just to clarify, are you telling a Police Prosecutor that they are dead wrong in relation to what can and can't be cautioned by Police?
47. It appears that you have your mind made up and you don‚Äôt/won‚Äôt/can‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôve explained to you numerous times. I don‚Äôt know any other way that I can enlighten you on this topic, so I think it‚Äôs best to leave things here. All the best on your educational journey about the Qld Justice System, specifically in relation to crimes committed by youths.
48. Firstly that vote was far from overwhelming. Secondly, that's not what I'm saying. Those are not the words i wrote, is your brain broken? Why are you assigning me a narrative that I didn't say? You all need to stop cherry picking a single word out of my entire comment to try to make an inflammatory point, it's an invalid way to make an argument.
49. Your obsession with rioting when that's not the point of anything exposes that you don't comment in good faith. I'm done being goaded into continually talking about rioting like it's a word in your spank bank. Ground level. Community action comes first, protests next etc. Why are you obsessed with an extreme action that hopefully never happens? Do you work for Sky News? I've responded to you too many times already, but this is the last.
50. Sorry whose staffer are u/NeverSharted? Basically what I‚Äôm hearing is that your taxpayer funded job is perfectly fine‚Ä¶ even though you‚Äôre spending your day on Reddit. But you know exactly where to slash other people‚Äôs jobs. Sounds like you represent exactly who I voted against and exactly why I want you and your minister as far away from power as possible.
51. So why not just say abortion? Are you ashamed deep down, or do you recognise that most people aren't informed on how bad the laws are and if they looked into them they would be rightfully outraged by the sheer barbarism that has been allowed in their name? Did the doctors performing medically necessary late term terminations of pregnancy often run into legal issues before the laws changed, or are you full of shit? The foetus is a living human lol, what do you think it is, a rock?
52. Is it now? Can you provide a medical source for that definition please? Given that the overwhelming existing reason for what you‚Äôre calling ‚Äòlate term abortion‚Äô is for the health of the mother, if you support abortion as healthcare for a mother at risk, why are arguing against late term abortion? I don‚Äôt believe that healthy and rational women are flippantly terminating perfectly healthy and viable fetuses the way you are suggesting.
53. Yes. I am. You claimed that youth committing rape are being cautioned by Police. I am telling you that you are wrong. I have oodles of case studies, case notes, judgments, and legislation etc to confirm you are wrong. You have... a stupid claim that it's happening of which you can not provide proof. Also a Police prosecutor doesn't make you special. As a 2nd year law student I already know more than you.
54. No. You're wrong. Unless you're claiming you have broken the law as a Police Officer to coerce minors to admitting to crimes in exchange for cautions? You. Can't. Be. Cautioned. As. A. Consequence. For. Rape. Even. As. A. Minor. If. A. Minor. Admits. To. Rape. They. Will. Be. Charged. As. It. Is. A. Serious. Indictable. Offence. (Once their claim that they committed rape is substantiated) Police can not just willy nilly give out cautions. If someone is accused of rape, it will be thoroughly investigated (as it is required by law) and the bare minimum that Police need is a witness testimony (preferably the victims). They can not just caution someone for a serious indictable offence because they feel like it - Which you are claiming they can. For serious offence, which rape is, police must have *credible* evidence that a crime has been committed before proceeding with any charges or diversions - This *includes* cautions. The Youth Justice Act 1992 provides avenues (such as cautions) for dealing with minors. Under the Youth Justice Act 1992, cautions are reserved for *minor offences* and can only occur after a full investigation. For a minor to be cautioned for a rape, the Police would first need to establish reasonable belief (based on evidence) that the crime occurred. If there is *no evidence*, police cannot lawfully issue a caution. Instead the investigation would need to continue until they did, or if no crime is found the case will be closed. IF the police found evidence the crime of rape occurred (which would be required to issue a caution), then the youth would be charged with rape (not cautioned), because the offence is a serious indictable offence in QLD. This is what I have explained to you. Police can't issue cautions willy nilly. They're an official police power. They're not a Police Officer going "Yea... don't do that." - They're officially recorded and can count against you if you're charged for further crimes. Having a caution recorded is not the same as a criminal conviction, but it most definitely has an official process - which if you were a Police Officer, you would know that. All of this is in the Youth Justice Act 1992. Edit: And just to emphasise how even more 'not happening' this is. Police in QPS, per their own OPM, require approval from a Detective Inspector to caution a minor for rape or attempted rape. If an officer seeks that approval, they must consider the "sufficiency of evidence", "Public interest", circumstances of the offence, wants of the victim (and their family), and the age and developmental state of both victim and offender. This would make it a **rare and exceptional** occurrence. You saying "They can and are issuing cautions for minors committing rape" is so absurd. Humans can technically fly as well, will you be jumping off the roof next thinking you're Superman? Probably not, because even you understand that it won't actually happen.
55. You lost one third of your seats, secured just 33% of the primary vote (lowest since 1908 excluding 2012), lost mackay and rockhampton and got smashed in townsville. But yeah, no I must be stupid, hardly overwhelming. Probably time to bust out the pitchforks and take to the streets and start the riot.
56. Dude, check yourself. I have no ‚Äòobsession‚Äô with rioting and I didn‚Äôt raise it to begin with. You did. I said people should peacefully accept the results of the election. I‚Äôm not sure what planet you‚Äôre living on, but you seem to get hot under the collar very easily (hence the propensity to riot I guess).
57. my taxpayer funded job isn‚Äôt in the public service.
58. Because people like you like to co opt the term and create an image of a new born being callously killed by a flippant wicked woman. When the reality is, the majority of abortions are either heart wrenching procedures done on people trying to make the best choice for themselves and their unborn child OR it‚Äôs literally referring to the procedure to remove an already dead fetus from the womb. It‚Äôs the same word for both and you are erasing its necessity as a medical procedure by denying it Doctors did run into trouble, here you go: - 1985, R v Bayliss and Cullen, which was the main basis for abortion law in QLD for decades Between then and 2009, there were clinics available that essentially operated in a grey area however there was a drama in Cairns where a couple procured medication for an at home abortion without medical supervision. This led to a withdrawal of some existing abortion services in regional QLD due to the media coverage etc. So yes, doctors did run into legal trouble. Later in 2009, the criminal code (Section 282) was updated to protect doctors who performed any surgical procedure or provided medication for the benefit of their patient. This was not specific to abortion but again, a legal grey area that could be applied. In reality, anyone with money and resources can just nip down south.
