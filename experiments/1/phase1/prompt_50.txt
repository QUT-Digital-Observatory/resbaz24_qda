Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. \> 46% of people had been a victim of crime in the past year or directly **knew someone** that had been. What kind of data point is that? The only way to phrase a category in that way is to attempt to distort the numbers to suit a narrative. No one is saying that youth crime is down across the board. But the data shows that, over a 10-year period, it's been decreasing. And for most types of crimes there's been a drop. But newspapers, media and the LNP colluded to brand this as a "youth crime epidemic", which is a gross exaggeration intended to get an emotional reaction from voters. No one has been able to point to specific crime numbers over time that justifies the beat up that happened. It's either cherry picked numbers or personal anecdotes. The most damning Courier Mails numbers - which they branded an epidemic - was to say "offender rate increased from 1863 offenders per 100,000 people to 1925" over a one-year period. Thats a 5% change. Every LNP voter who has responded on this thread has used the excuse that their personal opinion about crime is more valid than the actual data. This is the kind of bullshit that has infested US politics, and we should absolutely be calling out. There was similar US-style sketchiness from Labor in this cycle too, which shouldn't be rewarded.
2. >Labor’s response that crime had decreased is disingenuous though and that’s the problem. It’s not down, it’s down in some areas, but it’s up significantly in assaults, b&e and motor theft relative to the previous 4 years. It's down per total population, do you have data on which areas have had it increased?
3. >You can try and target poor kids at risk before they turn to crime Innocent until proven guilty, amirite? This just leads to "They're treating me like a fucking criminal anyways, I may as well act the part".
4. I’d just like to add my 2 cents as a victim of domestic violence who was was held captive and severely abused, and unhappy with the outcome from the judicial system. Not the same as youth crime but still a victim of violent crime, and my thoughts can be expanded to all types of crime. My abuser was sent away for 8 months. While in prison he was using his flying monkeys to contact me and try to get me to call him. When he left prison he’s tried to contact me multiple times. I do not feel safer in a punitive justice system, where they throw people like my abuser away to fester and become worse people. I would feel a lot more comfortable with the 8 month sentence if rehabilitation and restorative justice were implementations for prisons. But it’s not like that. Because why do policies proven to reduce recidivism and reduce crime when the prisons can just leech money by keeping as many beds full as possible. Money is much more important apparently than actually creating a safer, more just society. In countries with rehabilitative and restorative justice policies, recidivism rates are 20% for a 5 year period, in comparison to Australia where our recidivism rate is 55% for the same time period. More than half the people in prison now will re-enter prison. How can people still rail for punitive justice when it’s doing the opposite of what they claim to want, a safer society.
5. > For some of them, their actions are extreme enough that they need to be separated from society, regardless of how sad their upbringing is. The challenge is how do you do it in away that rehabilitates rather than just punishes. You’ve inadvertently stumbled onto the entire point. The criminal system is _not_ the best way to rehabilitate. Convictions last a _really_ long time and you can’t even get a job at Macca’s without a background check. Trust me, I know, I’ve done shit I’m not proud of but the magistrate’s decision not to record has been invaluable to making sure I can maintain a decent career and not repeat my mistakes. “Adult crime, adult time” is the opposite of this. Rehabilitation shouldn’t be the goal, _prevention_ should be. The government has a lot of departments, and it’s appalling that QPS is apparently the first-line one. There’s even one with “child” in its name, and still it’s blind until everything has already gone to custard. (And, by the way, the fact this is downvoted appalls me. It turns out that /r/brisbane is all about putting kids in jail and fucking up their lives instead of actually coming up with real solutions. Fuck you. I mean it, you are actual scum. Fuck you.)
6. And this is all I’m saying- you’ve put it more eloquently than me.
7. I'm not delegitimizing anything, nor am I saying to blindly trust the process. I don't think you and the other gentleman are understanding that... I'm actually advocating for a better system, but what Queensland just voted for is not a better system. It just isn't and history shows that. We've had "tough on crime" policies in the past and they've universally ended in worse outcomes for young offenders AND communities. Crisafulli hasn't said anything about addressing the staggering levels of poverty that exist in some of these communities, or social programs to help struggling families that are in poverty. Until Crisafulli addresses these issues, his populist policies will not deliver anything, it won't deliver justice to victims and communities. And it won't deliver rehabilitated offenders that have broken the cycle.
8. https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/100936#:~:text=The%20latest%20crime%20statistics%20from,18%25%20since%202012/13.
9. Not once have I made excuses. And it's getting frustrating having people say that ALL the time simply because I don't blindly follow the "throw children into adult prisons" narrative. And you're correct punishing crime and treating poverty doesn't have to be mutually exclusive. But that's exactly what the LNP is doing. They aren't interested in the poverty side of and its inherent link to crime. You can't solve the crime side of things without addressing the poverty side of it. As a result communities will continue to experience crime when they do t have to. Children don't know right from wrong, especially children who've only ever known a life of poverty and crime. Which again, addressing that side of it will go a long way to preventing the offending side of it.
10. Ok elevate the attempted murder charge to the murder charge and guess what.. they'll finish the job next time. Why not? Dead guy can't testify! America is the living model for this.
11. So since QCS spends over 90k per year per prisoner, you'd prefer to be sending your tax dollars toward locking up these kids instead of using that money to maybe deal with the poverty, domestic violence, mental health and other failures of our society? You seriously think these kids prefer crime and jail over help?
12. Respect!!
13. Singapore also focused on reducing poverty and raising literacy rates and provided housing for all.
14. Singapore is a poor example. Median income increased by 40% over 10 years, which adjusted for inflation, is a growth of 2% every year. 1 in 10 households exist in poverty in Singapore, however this stat is massively inflated by foreign workers under cheaper labour taking blue collar jobs. https://borgenproject.org/poverty-singapore/ It's also interesting to note that in 2022, physical crime increased, but wasnt instigated by necessity of poverty. these were crimes for Modesty, Voyeurism, and Molestation
15. We never said Debbie's didn't exist... Just said the amount of them was drastically exaggerated by the media... If people were saying it, it was a minority of them 🤷
16. That’s just so deeply painful. I know TUH has a ridiculous amount of aged patients boarding, waiting for care. I sincerely hope you can get assistance before your hand is forced. Keep on them.
17. And the LNP privatising ambulances and not putting money into expanding hospitals or health services will help that how
18. Projection.
19. Hospitals are still recovering from when they gutted them last time.
20. What pisses me off is people pretending like TIMING isn't a huge issue depending on where you happen to be in your life. If the LNP manages to BAN abortion for the next 4 years, that can absolute destory someone's life. It doesn't matter for them that it eventually gets over turned.
21. Maybe I should start updating my resume…
22. Oh but wait - mining royalties are out now with LNP in.... government can't fund all the other initiatives without it so will be interesting to see what stays....
23. Ah, another conservative who only gives a fuck about themselves. Fuck off. I am so sick of your kind. You just fuck everyone over because it's all about you. Get. Right. Fucked.
24. And he’s going to fund that without mining royalties _how_ exactly? Their platform _requires_ razor gangs to work.
25. Great way to show you lack critical thinking skills hasn’t the debate talked about the disproportionate impact on marginalised communities
26. Calling a disabled woman "ridiculously over dramatic" about her very legitimate fears and concerns regarding her own health and wellbeing. That's the way mate, good one 👍
27. People said the same thing before Campbell Newman fucked us for decades. I’m not buying what you’re selling.
28. it's really sad that you think community and solidarity are worth nothing. rallies aren't enough as a political tool, rallies alone don't achieve change. but they are important for morale. i feel like your anger and frustration is really misplaced towards protestors and I'd be curious to know why
29. You are lying. Again. LNP members were quizzed on that on ABC coverage. Amanda Stoker bit her tongue in the middle of a sentence when asked, before repeating the party line, which is “it’s not in our plan”. Not “they won’t be changing” - that’s you lying and sowing disinformation. They have said no such thing, and DC has refused constantly to say it out loud on record. KAP is their “useful tool” to attack those rights, because they can say “oh, it was a conscience vote”.
30. :(
31. yeah they fucked up, but it will happen
32. Yep but it’s just the message it sends, it makes us feel unwanted and hated, even if it has no practical effect. I do wonder what the LNP have in store for us this term. Palasczcuk on the other hand did a lot in her first term to bring our rights into the 21st century. For example she looked into historical cases where people were charged and convicted of a crime for “homosexuality”, especially during the 70s and 80s under Sir Joh where qld police would pretend to be gay at a gay bar and then charge someone if they later initiated sexual contact. She apologised to these people and as far as possible expunged the criminal records from it. Bligh and Beattie never did that and it never would have happened under an LNP government.
33. That’s because he didn’t know if he’d need Katter or not. Now he does not.
34. No, they’re not right. They’re making shit up.
35. lol no one is pro hamas. Being against the genocide that the IDF is perpetrating is not the same as supporting terrorists.
36. A latte and some sour grapes.
37. The LNP just won power. They are not going to jeopardise staying in another term by supporting this
38. And a couple of Labor members did too
39. You understand legal abortions existed before the law was changed don’t you?
40. I dont think they will.. I think he was only taking that position because they thought it would be tight and didn't want to put off any of the more conservative voters. Which is not a great position granted...
41. Where did they say they wanted to put them in adult prisons? We have purpose built juvenile facilities which will do fine. And I actually agree something needs to change. 3 weeks ago my neighbour got their cars (both of them) stolen by a "kid" who was already on bail for 41 like offences... what part of that system exactly do you think is working?? Cause its clearly fucking not!
42. Time will tell i guess. But I am highly sceptical
43. Yeh I'll agree with this
44. Comment respectfully. Continued harassment may result in you being banned.
45. Haha nah.. good one actually. Thanks for asking. Typical.. reverts to insults. You have actually made zero points.
46. Ok stupid.
47. When they are killing male babies does it become my business because they are the same sex as me?
48. This would be a tremendous public service to the community. Just look at how many people don't even know the voting history of the lnp.
49. That would be great
50. Let me know if you need a hand
51. That’s how bad labour have been!
52. The start of your last paragraph sums up different ideologies really simply. Voting "against' something rather than "for".
53. Free lunch at public school would do more to address the root cause than any punishment ever would.
54. You should read the thread I’ve got going on 😂
55. it makes sense tho, if ur a kid who murdered someone or a pet or came close to. u deserve adult time, idc if u grew up impoverished or whatever
56. Of course it’s a huge issue in some areas. You shooting your mouth off when likely you have no knowledge either way does not make it go away. Ask the people of Townsville what they think….
57. Agreed. I’m in one of those and I can assure you it is a problem here. Our Facebook pages have daily photos and posts, and there’s a lot - individuals and small groups caught on CCTV trying car and house doors, groups of kids driving cars that are clearly not theirs (people have discovered their car was stolen that way), etc. Our numbers may or may not show us any worse for crime than other cities per capita, but we definitely have youth criminals blatantly running around, with elements of organisation, who anticipate few consequences. (Doesn’t mean I’m thrilled by the election result, but I would take it as a consolation prize if he can actually improve the situation). (Edit to add) We’re not scared to leave our house or live here now, and we wouldn’t leave, it’s still the best place we’ve ever lived. But when we bought our investment properties we did make sure to buy one in a gated community so we would have an option if it ever got to the point, as we got older and more frail, that we didn’t feel safe anymore.
58. Here we go someone bringing rational thought to the conversation.
59. If your not catching and arresting these cunt kids then that's not included in the statistics either
60. You can’t single out a certain group. It has to been seen as equal
61. I think you’ve got that ass backwards. Overall it’s not a problem, the statistics are clear on that. But there may be pockets where it is a problem
62. No, it literally isn't.
63. They *always* make it one. Every time there is an election coming up in a Labor held state you get flooded with news about it. Not just news, but the almost daily fake posts about how "I got assaulted today in the city, its getting so bad" etc etc.
64. And then have claimed that the state has chosen “hope over fear” by electing them 🙄
65. It probably was an issue for the people who have been victimised though.
66. Simply not true. You are twisting statistics to suit your stance. Statewide statistics don’t reflect actual issues. Everyone knows the youth crime is horrible in FNQ regional centres.
67. Yes. They are saying there would be value in having one.
68. I know. Also Queenslander here
69. Exactly my point. A simple majority can get sweeping changes without any compromise
70. Didn’t One Nation at some point receive money from the NRA?
71. But they don't. Why would they care about us?
72. Stoker really _hated_ having to say it “wasn’t on our plan” - you could tell by the way she had to stop herself in the middle of a sentence and change it - she was about to say something else for sure.
73. Yep, I never understood that complaint about school.
74. Confused about a lot of things I’d say.
75. And why does an entity like a person, business, or state engage in a contract which places them in debt? I'm sure there a few reasons. Can you list a couple? 🤔
76. Except when you have a surplus, you can pay down debt. I mean, it's not a hard concept to grasp. Just like the fact that having a government spending money to provide services is what a government is for. Or do you think the party in power should sit atop a pile of gold like some very boring and uncharismatic version of Smaug?
77. This. Repayments on debt are an expense. The surplus is when income exceeds expenses!
78. Yes, but please remember that the gov borrowed to give the $1000 energy rebate. That has to be paid back at some point which means instead of feeling the pinch 3 months ago, we'll feel it in the next 3 years at some point. That $1k helped me a lot and I appreciate it but that doesn't mean it's good policy. Who knows, maybe it helped advert a greater economic disaster but I'm not sure. But what it definitely can't do is control inflation, if anything it could make it a bit worse in the medium term. On top of this those benefits mainly help Brisbane but not rural areas. Rural qld doesn't really use or have access to public transport. This showed in the election with rural seats flipping. Both parties have been bringing in mass immigration to try to increase growth, which hasn't worked as they expected. This has caused a housing crisis. Qld ALP started social housing sites which may reduce tents but still have high pressure on demand. LNP has committed to more stock which means urban sprawl and fights with environmentalists. We'll see what happens i guess
79. “No one is saying youth crime is down across the board. But the data shows that, over a 10-year period, it’s been decreasing.” Yes all “crime” is decreasing - mostly due to fewer drug related crimes. But over the last 4 years, assault, motor theft and b&e are all increasing, and that is the thing that aligns with people’s experience. Edit: and hang on, yes, people are definitely claiming crime overall is down. And if you claim that the singular category “crime” is decreasing over 10 years, you are absolutely implying that crime is down wtf are you talking about and it’s *especially* bizarre to talk in 10 year terms if the government has only been in 8 years and the previous government got voted out because it was too aggressive in its approach bordering on draconian reducing crime And as for “what kind of data point as that?” -it’s a data point that speaks directly to how people are *feeling* about crime - and that’s what drives election results. Sure, it’s a disputable statistic from a survey, but I have to say it’s interesting how many people on here see the comment and agree with it, and it’s certainly my experience in Brisbane, everyone has either had a car stolen or had their neighbour’s house broken into. it’s pretty clear people generally *feel* that crime is up, and that’s because crime that people are most likely to directly experience, motor theft or assault, is up, and for some reason people want to play word games and say “yeah but *all* crime is down”… well we saw how that dismissive approach went.
80. Yes as I said, each of the cats I named are up notably
81. That’s the rub - the targeting shouldn’t be by the criminal justice system. There are other agencies that are better placed to intervene (and yes, some of them are Federal, _Centrelink_). To use a slogan I adopt a lot, this needs to be treated almost as a public health problem, not a criminal justice problem. QLD Labor recognised that with drugs (which, no doubt, LNP will roll back in mere minutes to appear “tough on crime”), but all major parties on a policy platform level fail to recognise that with regard to youth recidivism. And I include the Greens in that.
82. “Jail for life for robbery? Might as well stab the victim, lower chance of getting caught that way!”
83. But what is to be done with juveniles who commit violent crime? What is to be done to protect society from those committing crimes now? There is case just recently in NSW where a 17 year old broke into the home of an elderly couple, sexually assaulted an 88 year old woman, and was give no jail sentence, straight onto parole. What impact is that going to have on the life of that elderly couple? Imagine the fear the must now live in? How must the family of the elderly feel, knowing this 17 hear old got essentially no punishment for this heinous crime? I understand that the criminal system might not be the best for rehabilitation, but what about justice? Is that something the left has decided is no longer important? Seems like it's a bitter pill for victims to have to swallow? Just suck it up, the person that wronged you isn't going suffer any punishment because it might inconvenience them for future job prospects?
84. I understand that. What I am saying to you is I am not surprised when people have their experiences dismissed by being told they’re stupid and emotional, or by being told the things they experiencing and the people around them are experiencing aren’t happening, that they decided to vote for a change while knowing it probably wouldn’t fix the longer term problem for these kids but would probably fix their shorter term problem of being victims of crime and being scared.
85. I don’t think you per se and maybe I’m now more just angry about the it’s FNQ fault or FNQ are hicks comments But I personally just want to feel safe and the current programs haven’t done that for me. Maybe liberals programs won’t either but you can’t blame me for wanting something or anything Like most Queenslanders I want a better Queensland but I also feel so disenfranchised within the 2 party system that I almost don’t even care who gets in because I don’t genuinely believe these people care about me or my struggles or even the struggles of my neighbour
86. If you don't know right from wrong at 15 you should be locked up People act like you suffer from a partial lobotomy until the age of thirty
87. It would be a real incentive to cutting the crime rate that's for sure At that rate it would take 3500 criminals off the street for the same cost of the 50c fares. Using this years police figures, around the same number of arrests for unlawful use of a motor vehicle in Brisbane (but we all know there are people with multiple arrests for the same crime)
88. yeah it’s terrible. in the meantime my spouse and i have moved in, spouse has quit their job along with my brother in law as the caring tasks need 2 people now. my fil and i both work away (mining) just to keep up with the costs. it’s fucked 😂 thank you for your kind words and letting me vent
89. Those are ridiculous claims.
90. Hospitals are in deep shit already. I shudder to think what these fuckwits will do to an already struggling health system in the next 4 years.
91. Really fun time to be a healthcare worker, as if getting through COVID has been a holiday
92. And that recovery is about to be absolutely shit on. GCUH already has massive issues that need fixing. They are about to be in deep shit.
93. If “not my circus, not my monkeys” was a voter base…
94. Yep. My partner’s disabled and is on a public waiting list to get diagnosis and effective treatment. Even moderate cuts to the healthcare system can set them back years on the path to getting their life back on track. 4 years of batshit funding decisions is going to severely affect their quality of life for the foreseeable future.
95. Couldn’t hurt.
96. All this mining talk makes me laugh, you know the referendum was bankrolled by and stood to hugely benefit mining and resource companies?
97. You are the type of person that takes a shit and because the poo is brown, you say sorry and feel for it before fushing it down the toilet. Always referencing race and the colour of someone. I dont care if it is an Asian that breaks into a house, I dont care if it is an African that kills a grandma, I dont care if it is an Islander that steals a car, I dont care if it is a white person that steals someones purse and is in a vehicle pursuit with the cops. Race doesnt mean anything to me and it doesnt impact my daily life or how I vew others. The only time Race is even in my head is when someone or some organistation talks about it with their white guilt. And honestly, I don’t care if a certain race or area gets targeted more by police or laws—if people are committing serious crimes and breaking social norms, they deserve to face the consequences. It’s not about “disproportionate impact”; it’s about not committing heinous acts in the first place. If you don’t want to be a target, don’t steal cars, don’t break into houses, and don’t terrorize communities. The law’s there to protect society, and if some groups end up in trouble more often, maybe the focus should be on fixing that behavior, not making excuses for it. And before you try and bring racism onto me again, I am an islander myself and work with troubled kids.
98. Thank you very much for this ❤️ and yes, definitely a woman.
