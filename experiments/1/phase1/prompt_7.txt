Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. I’m a morning person, and I love it. Brisbane is too humid to have everyone gong to bed an hour early
2. What god awful time do you leave work?
3. If it takes you that long to commute maybe you need a different job.
4. Ah my god!!! There’s nothing we can do about it!!!
5. Wait something is free? Don't tell the Libs or they'll privatise it!
6. Just like how people in this sub can’t stop calling anyone who don’t vote ALP “stupid boomer”/“dumb bogan”
7. > Your understanding isn't quite correct. It's not the party with the most votes that wins - it's not a popular vote system. And be fucking thankful we don't, if we ran on popular vote first past the post we'd almost only ever have LNP governments.
8. Nah if you come here and have a sook about a satire article because it picks on your favourite politician then you'll get downvoted for being a softie.
9. democracy/lemmings
10. Because all that is on here is 'election' related. This place should be renamed r/qldpolitics
11. How's that new Premier? ;)
12. What are your pronouns big boy
13. Yep the LaborGreens and promiscuous hoes of inner Brisbane love the baby chopping rituals to Moloch
14. Sounds like it shouldn’t bother you if it’s implemented then…. Don’t like it, plenty of jobs with flexible times, find one.
15. Not sure why people want it, but it is widely studied that it's bad for the human body
16. The sun coming up at 430 is a bit of a prick
17. After I've left work, commuted through the city, picked up my kid and got home, it's 4:30-5pm. It starts getting dark by 5:30, and sunset at 6. I leave work around 3:30-4pm.
18. Wow how detached from reality are you?
19. I must say, I do enjoy leaving home at 2am for those early Lismore/Casino starts at this time of year...............
20. But they aren't wrong.
21. Move Brisbane to GMT+11 permanently, please. North Queensland can do whatever they want, as proven on Saturday clearly Brisbane and the rest of the state are absolutely nothing alike.
22. This coming from someone detached enough to think that changing the clocks gives them more daylight....
23. >Move Brisbane to GMT+11 permanently, please. ![gif](giphy|STfLOU6iRBRunMciZv)
24. Unless your workplace also slides their working hours an hour earlier to match, then your point is incorrect. If work hours stay the same, then there is an "extra" hour of daylight after work. And one less beforehand. Imagine if the company you worked for changed their operating hours so that it maximise the 5 wasted daylight hours between dawn and 9am? With the sun rising so, so early in summer it would in many cases make more sense for companies to change working hours to something like 7am-3am or 8am-4pm in summer instead of the usual 9-5 we adopted. The sun has already been up for 3hrs by 7am. But it's obviously ridiculous to expect every company to change their operating hours coordinated all at once - it would never happen - so some parts of the world just changed their clocks instead, effectively making the work day earlier and "saving more daylight". So it doesn't "give" more daylight, but it "saves" it from the early, early morning and credits it to the end of the day. Which is why it's Daylight Savings and not Daylight Givings.
25. You are on a high stool of privilege it seems, hence why you have zero clue how life works outside of your bubble.
26. So having gotten the required qualifications and found a job thay pays well enough without chewing up hours in commuting is privilege? Perhaps you should look at your life and realise you're responsible for the situation you're in. Quit expecting others to completely alter their lives to suit you.
27. ROFL. Geezus you are spoilt.
28. You're insane.
29. Says the person who said to just get a new job if your work finishes later than 4pm. AKA nearly all jobs.... Geezus.
30. Obviously you fail at reading comprehension. I said if a commute means you get home after sunset in summer the you might want to reconsider if your job is worth the sacrifice you're making. That's what I did many years ago and am very happy I did so. Daylight savings isn't needed when the sun won't go down until 7pm on December 21st If you can't live without DST, then perhaps you should relocate to somewhere that suits your preferences instead of whining about it.
31. Or you know, like every other city in Australia, SEQ could do a solid….
32. Again why, it serves no purpose and is annoying as hell.
33. That sounds like a you problem 😂
34. No my problem is holier than thou idiots wanting to inflict a stupid idea on the rest of us, somehow not getting the message it's unwanted
35. It sure does sound like your problem.
36. Yet strangely the majority of Queensland's agree with me. If you want daylight savings that badly there are plenty of states to pick from.
37. The majority of QLDers are stupid enough to vote LNP, so it really means nothing.
38. Well if you dislike it that much, again, you're free to move to somewhere that suits you.
39. I’d rather chip away at the stupid.
40. If you were no longer in Queensland the level of stupid would drop significantly.
41. Are you suggesting everyone would move with me? That's a kind thought, but it's not that simple unfortunately :-(
42. I live in a safe Labor seat. I did vote Green, but honestly it was a coin-toss between them and Labor this time, because I'd seen very little from the local Green candidate and the performance of Greens federally has been somewhere between mediocre and bad. In the end, they got my vote (with Labor second) simply because I knew my vote would end up with Labor anyway, but I want my local member to know how many of their votes are actually coming from Greens voters (which might explain why they're borrowing Greens policies). Honestly, if the Greens keep up with whiny bullshit like this article, or keep blocking half-decent policies federally because they aren't good enough, they probably won't be getting my vote in the future. FFS, do better Greens.
43. >In fact, on the day of the election and the preceding day, Steven Miles was spending his time in seats that were some of our best prospects, rather than fighting the LNP, which is why David Crisafulli is now the premier. I usually vote Green, but this has to be one of the stupidest arguments I've heard. Parties have every right to campaign in seats where they have a chance of winning. That's as true for inner-Brisbane left seats as it is for margin urban seats like Townsville or Bundaberg. To argue that the ALP shouldn't waste energy campaigning for a seat that they will probably now win is ridiculous. In fairness, I have heard the same argument (inverted) coming from ALP members - that the Greens aid the Liberals by tying up ALP resources fighting on the left flank. But it's part of a maturing democracy.
44. I'm a Greens member, and I don't agree with what they're saying at all. We need to take responsibility for our own campaign, do some reflection and build up towards the Federal Election with solid plans, policies, and optics.
45. I’m usually a Green voter imo Labor getting more progressive as a result of people voting Greens is only a good thing, these policies are a good thing for our state no matter whose idea it was or who ultimately implemented them. I think there was very little the ALP or the Greens could have done to stop the swing, it’s impressive how close it ended up being.
46. If the greens had brains and actually cared about society, keep coming up with good ideas and keep letting them be stolen. If it’s a good idea and it’s being implemented without needing bums on seats you’re winning.
47. This is my first election in quite a while not putting Greens first, this time was ALP first. Why I switched was the toxic feel from federal Greens leaves me with a bad taste for the Greens all over. Hearing them constantly directly attack ALP and barely hear a peep about LNP, the pushing of issues that feel like a headline bite, and trying on environmental policies that aren't practical (e.g. all new electric by 2030 which requires about 1M vehicles per year), and I'm left feeling like they are not interested in working with anyone, finding common ground, nor interested in creating real, practical policies which could both pass legislation and be could be implemented in the real world Then from local I feel like it spills up, I am not a fan of councilors encouraging acts of public nuisance and many members don't realise they need a certain decorum as an official governmental rep, and instead behave like an independent hippie. If I vote for a Green who isn't already in, I don't know what I'm going to get. I really, *really,* want them to take notice of this election and look inside and make some changes. We need their voice.
48. To to credit Labor, they see a good idea, doesn't matter where it's from and implement it.
49. The state greens should also blame the actions of the federal greens.
50. You mean the Greens are blaming everyone else instead of looking for at themselves in the mirror? What a Greens thing to do
51. I think it shows the Greens are completely out of their depth if they are blaming Labor. KAP played them all with the abortion ban, and pushed Greens voters to Labor in an attempt to stop the LNP imo. Honestly, The Greens to me will always be a great upper house party, but they continue to irritate people and will never gain enough support to form a government in the lower houses.
52. The only people the greens can blame are the greens. They were terrible, disorganised and even people who wanted to vote for them had hardly any clue what sort of platform they were bringing.
53. Greenslopes, a solidly Labor seat, had a larger swing to the Greens than the swing to the LNP.
54. To tell you the truth I don't see at all how the Greens and Labor could form a coalition. I understand the QLD Greens aren't quite the same as the Federal Greens, but at the end of the day I don't think the Greens are willing to play "junior" coalition partner. Can you imagine if the Nationals had turned around to the Liberals and demanded 0% tax for all regional communities before supporting the stage 3 tax cuts? That is more or less an equivalent to the Greens asking for a rent freeze before supporting the construction of more rental properties. The need for compromise on perfection just doesn't seem to work as well for the Greens as it does for the Nationals.
55. The Greens had a terrible result. Blaming Labor or anyone else is more about MCM defending his own appalling conduct
56. Missing the old Greens, where the focus was laser sharp on environmental protection, and Bob Brown commanded admiration all round.
57. The Greens always crying its someone else's fault. I seem to recall them playing the same tactics by running candidates in Labor seats but not bothering with many Liberal seats in several past elections. There's countless examples around energy policy and housing where Greens either sided with Liberals to kill bills or don't seemingly really want a solution because they are getting traction on it, see housing. They are the ideology party, unless its exactly what we want then are we taking our bat and ball and holding a press conference. They regularly lose any credibility they build with these tactics. They are the embodiment of demanding the perfect at the expense of the good to the detriment of us all.
58. "Labor's fault" Horseshoe theory is real.
59. https://preview.redd.it/0tyh1z5ozfxd1.png?width=1008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f4fabcc2c0b675c75d1d46487534a58fec58020 The "stolen" policies part is editorialised junk and not what was actually said fyi. Greens policy is about pushing Labor left, the complaint from greens is that Labor would rather lose majority to LNP than work with greens to achieve good policy - evidenced by what seats they focused on in the election.
60. Statewide greens vote had zero swing, which is pretty strong considering Labor has such a massive swing against them. I don’t think the greens had a poor showing at all.
61. Actually it’s funny last few years I have never seen a green candidate in my area and providing there list but only labour liberals party.
62. I'm a Greens voter but must admit some disappointment with this campaign and the response. Their policies are things I align with, but they spend so much time bashing Labor they forget to be part of the process. Even if Labor stole a policy, great. At least it's being implemented. Get engaged and involved in getting more done. We don't always have to be disruptive. I get that without political donations they can stretch as far in terms of campaigning and such, but there definitely can be better use of resources. It's fine to acknowledge that another party has implemented your policy, but then frame the messaging differently instead of bashing it. "They stole our work" sounds more tantrum like, than acknowledging
63. In the last 10-15 years, Labor has been slowly stepping to the right to try and keep up with the LNP, which allowed the Greens the chance to grab the left leaning vote from them. Now that Labor has made steps back to the left under the Miles Government, they are taking some of those votes back. And let’s be honest, if they didn’t make that move, then they would be a cricket team in parliament now. Hopefully the leadership spill of Labor will not get too nasty
64. Labor I think went for the Greens too much but it could be a bigger strategy for the federal election knowing they were likely going to lose the election anyway - the focus on current big issues in the US like abortion was just a bonus for Labor.
65. I doubt Greens would ever form a united party with Labor, especially if all they can do post election is blame Labor for their own performance.
66. The Greens: Labor are obsessed with us. Also the Greens: [https://ibb.co/yhCHJhB](https://ibb.co/yhCHJhB)
67. The Greens only have themselves to blame.
68. There is some general truth to the criticism, while the Libs and Nats Nationally 'work together' to form governments they have had a good wedge strategy against the ALP of accusing them of secretly working with the Greens. The ALP rather than adopting a 'so what' position are, as a party, self conscious about the accusation do everything they can to distance themselves from the Greens and denying any commonality in goals. It leads to the ALP fighting any election on 2 fronts and hurting themselves.
69. Imagine thinking that you have personal ownership over a good policy idea
70. How long does it normally take for all votes to be counted? I find it interesting that seats are called with just 20% of the votes in. A bit different to what i’m used to, not knocking it mind you.
71. I live in a major Liberal seat. I voted Labour first and Greens second - I would have voted the other way around, but my local Greens candidate/group just had no presence/policy platform/local engagement whatsoever. On that basis, there was absolutely no chance they were going to win or be the local Greens party I wanted/needed them to be.
72. The greens have themselves to blame, there roots are in conservation/environment and land management practices, now they basically have no environmental polices and have turned into a social justice warrior party..
73. I usually vote Green but this time they're were campaigning about doing something like closing off a throughfare and restoring wildlife habitat near my home, so I voted ALP.
74. the issue is that with things like 50c fares the alp spent a lot of time basically saying that the greens proposals for free and/or reduced fares were either outlandish, impractical or stupid then they readily turned around to act like it was a bold new idea theyd come up with. on the whole people who support the greens (like myself) who prefer labor to the lnp while still being fed up with them are not annoyed by the progressive policies but the actions of the alp in regards to how they choose to adopt ideas they critique when they come from outside their party. on top of that it is true that the alp spends a lot of effort either putting down or trying to stonewall the greens, i for one live in an area that until recently (unless the preferences switch) had greens on multiple levels can attest to a lot of effort being put into trying to turn people against the greens by the alp (while they still do basically nothing in the community itself compared to the greens) in my area. Miles himself also said that the alp wasnt willing to cooperate with the greens. this is why they get annoyed because it seems like the alp would rather reinforce the two party status quo than actually try to work with people willing to work with them.
75. Greens leadership somewhere: **"Steven Miles was able to win those seats in a cave! With a box of scraps!"** In less than 10 months, Steven Miles managed to save Labor from a projected 15\~ seat loss to 30+. What did the state Greens achieve in FOUR YEARS? Fuck all. Maybe they need to go back to the drawing board.
76. Crisafulli is premier because he, his party, and crapitalist media lied about a crime "crisis" in Queensland. Now they'll gut the public service, give big business all but a licence to literally kill people, and Labor will be elected to clean up the mess in another *four years - which they'll be blamed for not doing properly even if they do it well, after which we'll end up with another LNP government. Crapitalist "democracy" is a really, really bad joke.
77. The assumption in Berkman’s comments seems to be that Labor should have acted as if the Greens would be willing to enter in to some form of coalition if the two parties jointly had got enough seats, while sitting back and letting the Greens go all out to target their policies and seats.
78. The Greens support Chinese genocide and slavery. They killed the carbon tax in the federal Parliament They got some elected with their foolish Queensland protests They support terrorism as long as it's antisemitic They wouldn't investigate their party's sexual harassment. I can forgive most problems in a political party, including these, but why would I vote for a party that is hypocritical and ineffective? I voted for them until the Scomo disaster. I'm sure they mean well, but so do all the parties. The fact that they are blaming others for their failure is just another example of a behaviour pattern common in ineffective people and organisations.
79. The comments here are crazy. The Greens logic is entirely correct. Labor is a centrist party whether they like it or not. Politically engaged people on the left are going to vote Greens where they can, and they will only dislike Labor for not going hard/fast enough on progressive policies. Labor, trying to be a leftwing party, cannibalised the leftist vote. The huge Labor support in Brisbane came at the cost of Labor support in regional Queensland. State Labor has always had a hard time balancing right wing regions and left wing cities, but if Labor focused on the regions and let Brisbane fall to the Greens, we’d still have Labor running the state and Greens would be relevant rivals to the LNP. By focusing too much on their losses to the Greens, they caused the ultimate loss for both parties to LNP. Labor, strategically speaking, should have let the Greens win in Brisbane. Greens picking up 3-6 more seats in Brisbane while Labor scooped up half the regional seats would have lead to a better result than what we got. Greens aren’t wrong to complain about Labor here. Labor chose the wrong enemy. Edit: Downvoters, why? Are you saying that the Greens aren’t correct in saying that Labor’s use of Greens policies to win in safely Green seats lead to the Greens not getting as many votes and resulting in a LNP victory? Just because you like Labor doesn’t mean the Greens are wrong about what they’re saying.
80. Blame anything but their own poor judgement. Hint: if your seats retained go down, and your total vote goes DOWN, then you failed to resonate with voters. It doesn't matter how much your policies are the right ones, people have to vote for you. So you need to present policies that lots of people will vote for - not just your rusted-on supporters.
81. The Greens policies are solid. Up here on the Darling Downs I believe that the issue is that their local branch does a very poor job of engaging with the electorate outside of the election period. Last federal election an independent, Susie Holt, stood for Groom and at nearly beat the incumbent Liberal on preferences. She's maintained her presence since then and has been actively engaging with people at events. Last council election an independent, Andrew Reeson, stood for Toowoomba Region and came a close 11th. He's well known as a market trader and has continued to engage with the community at a grass roots level. The Greens should have their candidates for the next State election out into the community, living their values and building a rapport with the people they want to vote for them. They should be running events on core issues that matter to regional folk to bring more people into their membership.
82. Suck it greens 👎🤡
83. Nice to see Amy McMahon is now as irrelevant as Jono Sri
84. The Greens should blame themselves for having exactly zero coherent policies.
85. We can all say we want Labor to be more progressive but we have seen time and again that it categorically does not win elections in Australia. Look at the successful long-term state Labor governments, they have all had to veer to the right to stay in power.
86. I can’t believe the Greens’ Max Chandler Mathers rabbiting on about how “it’s labor’s fault”. Has there ever been anyone so arrogantly entitled in political history? He literally fucking won a seat off the ALP! Apparently Labor should just lie down and die peacefully when Greens are in the lead but the rule doesn’t apply in reverse! Rank hypocrisy of the highest order and just makes the Greens smell like every other political party, but worse - worse because first they trick you into breathing in their horseshit deeply in the hope of something different.
87. Greens are taking the piss. they keep apposing good policy, because it is not *their* policy. they seem to think it is their way or the highway. they do it federally as well, and it is killing support for them. I will never vote green when I see them stonewalling against project after project because it is not Precisely what they want. fuckers need to learn how to negotiate and get along, not dictate. they had a chance to grow and be a meaningful party and their ego got out of control and they blew it. I wonder if they will learn their lesson. this statement suggests not. Were we out of touch? nooo, It was Labor that was wrong!
88. Let them fight
89. Labor does do this as well, but yes, it is absurd for a political party to complain that a different party is competing with them.
90. I find it really frustrating that people think that anything progressive is automatically a greens policy. 50c fares was something miles wanted in young Labor so unless the greens have a time machine it's not "their" policy. It's also really frustrating because this idea that the greens make Australia more progressive is flat out not true. If your on the right in this country your not worried about the right. If your any version of progressive not in the greens your fucking surrounded because your worried about the left and the right. The greens are hyper cannibalistic they only target progressive seats, one nation will go anywhere and everywhere. They take these progressive seats that could be supporting progressive factions within lab and lib and use them to do fucking nothing except steal credit using the fantastic excuse that they currently exist ergo they have clearly copyrighted being progressive. They have zero solidarity on any level they spent this election attacking Labor despite the fact that there was so much riding on it and the Labor gov was actively pursuing progressive policies. They finished it by blaming Labor despite the fact that maiwar, their one seat, is only green because Labor is supporting and strongly prefrencing them and at a higher rate than they do Labor. The greens actively make it harder to be progressive, and they accomplish absolutely nothing whilst attacking anything Labor. Including policies they actively support its deeply frustrating.
