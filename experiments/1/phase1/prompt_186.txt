Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. We only had 5 here in McConnell. First time in my life I put ON (4) above LNP (5). Tells you how much I hate that shit stain Crissafulli..
2. I read this as Canadians and was very confused about why you expected there to be a high portion of Canucks.
3. I did rank the one nation candidate higher than 5 anyway, because they sure as shit won’t be getting in where I live.
4. same as me, and that is really odd But what happened to John Meyer Independent Green :-D
5. Wait until you only have the LNP and One Nation. Not me but I'm sure there's somewhere.
6. Yeah...i had to stop and think if i put ON or Greens last!? Big decision to be made
7. South Brisbane should have flipped to One Nation, the salt would be refreshing.
8. [deleted]
9. Number 4 for the Greens was way too high a number for me
10. If only there was a system where we didn’t have to decide
11. I’m sure we used to have a guy legally named Free Marijuana on the ballot
12. Are they usually senate seats? My citizenship was approved before, but I didn’t get my ceremony until after the last Federal Election. Will keep a look out for the single issue parties next year.
13. I’m not saying it makes sense for them to run candidates; just disappointed I could only rank ALP, LPN, Green and One Nation candidates.
14. But I had to rank them as high as 4th. 4 out of 4 still seems too high for the PHONeys.
15. The one reason I hate crossing the river.
16. For an independent, it depends on how high a profile (if any) they have. Generally people who have been a local councillor or mayor meets this criteria. Examples from previous parliaments have been Peter Wellington and Liz Cunningham. Sandy Bolton is another example. Looking at the current election, in addition to Sandy Bolton in Noosa, Margaret Strelow (former mayor) is a candidate in Rockhampton and polling shows she has a good chance, depending on preference flows. But then you get people who try again, again and again, only polling about 1% to 3% of the total votes each time. The epitome of the definition of madness.
17. Im in McConnell too, both my wife and I put ON last.
18. That literally sounds like hell. I wouldn’t wish that upon anyone.
19. How odd, how did that happen?
20. I would never downvote someone on reddit for an opinion I disagree with, but as I assume you are an LNP voter (and I apologise if I've assumed incorrectly) can you tell me why you've voted for them this election? I only ask because I'm a swing voter and I've struggled to come up with a compelling reason to vote LNP this year. They simply haven't offered anything but blatant dishonesty (the abortion debacle with certain members surreptitiously promising to walk back laws, crisafulli walking back promises like resigning if victim numbers not falling) and I just don't think I can trust them. Labor isn't a perfect party, there are plenty of genuine criticisms that can be levelled against them but it seems this time around there are even less compelling reasons to vote against them. I also really appreciate them operating on a platform of using our natural resources to help us thrive and feel like it has been long overdue. I will be sad to see it go if they lose. Anyway, just looking for genuine discussion, no hate to you. Democracy needs to be made up of different opinions.
21. They aren’t my first choice this year, but living in South Brisbane I am expecting them to win the seat.
22. Probably does pop up in some districts. Nothing stopping you from running but it's not a stateside vote like the senate is so you chances of getting in would be pretty slim. Where I am it was just Labor, LNP, Greens and ON. Same where I work.
23. I think Nigel used to stand in my old electorate of greenslopes. I always put him first, and Hanson party last. Maybe he did any by-election he could.
24. In federal elections you'll see a huge list of random one issue parties running for the senate. QLD doesn't have a senate it's the only state I've voted in so I don't know what other states are like with theirs. I'm just extrapolating from federal voting. The senate form for the national election is wild. It's huge. Should be a federal election in about May of next year which will include voting for half the senate.
25. Of all the seats I would have expected legalise cannabis to run in this one
26. I had the pleasure of putting them last. Other potential last options were LNP, Katter and Family First. It was a really tough call in who is the shittiest out of a list of very shit candidates.
27. In south central Brisbane it’s an ALP/Greens race. All my dyed in the wool Labor mates are increasingly anti Greens, they see them as promising unrealistic things to take votes from people who are trying to effect practical change.
28. Would an LNP voter complain about putting PHON anywhere higher than a 5?
29. I don’t mind the downvotes but I appreciate the respectful dialogue. I am an LNP voter. I’m a female, 42 and an RN (used to work for Queensland Health now a business owner). I view myself as more right wing but not the religious extremist sort. I think Miles is better than Anna but also I have seen the health system crumble into a shell of what it was. Are LNP perfect? Not at all but I am genuinely keen to see if they can make any changes. I live in inner city Brisbane and the crime here is repulsive. People coming into houses here in the middle of the day with knives. Can’t walk through musgave park it’s completely unsafe and now a ghetto. I’m so sick of the Greens and ALP party. Brisbane city council is LNP run and they do a great job. You may not agree with the above and I’ll probably get rinsed from the left but that is my opinion and stance on the issue 🤷‍♀️
30. Yeh I’m same electorate and Amy is the favourite to win. I actually put $50 on LNP and Labor because I’m hoping for a miracle 🤪
31. Only state that doesnt have a upper house
32. We call the federal senate voting sheet “the tablecloth”
33. In the last Vic state election there was about 40 parties and I think around 60 squares you could number if you voted below the line. The ballot paper was massive
34. I was talking to a few people about the senate ballot today about whether they mark above or below the line. Found it interesting that no one apart from myself filled out every number below the line.
35. Maybe I should look into it and run for them next time here.
36. yeah me too, in fact it looks like they don't have any Brisbane based seats, just some on the outskirts like Morayfield, Logan and Redlands.
37. This is interesting. Not really something I've heard before.
38. This is my electorate and I would 💯 prefer Labor over the Greens. We have them at council, state and federal level and they are full of hate and division.
39. I used to vote greens, but have switched to voting ALP. I see a lot more optimism in the labor campaigns whereas the greens have switched to fear campaigns and nimby-ism which feels disingenuous as if to win votes (rather than being what they believe in). I have found Amy MacMahon to be really disappointing - I couldn’t tell you one positive thing she has achieved during her time in office. She says she stopped the relocation of the school (I don’t see that as a win personally) but I haven’t seen any other achievements spruiked. When I’ve contacted her office I found them to be a bit condescending which surprised me. I think Jackie Trad had a more positive effect on the electorate (even though she was problematic). I feel like I’ve seen a lot less greens corflutes outside houses in this election, but in fairness I haven’t seen many for the other parties either. I guess we will see what the electorate thinks tonight, but I imagine the greens have the edge over labor as the sitting member and with the predicted swing against ALP.
40. You own trump memorabilia as an Australian but don’t see yourself as an extremist? Curious…
41. Thanks for the response. As an RN I actually find your opinion more interesting than many others. What do you think of ERs releasing real time patient wait list data? I've seen mixed responses about it but none from actual medical staff.
42. Didn’t you say you voted ALP in the other comment?
43. I’m West End and I’m hoping Labor swing in and win. Amy is the favourite but the ALP isn’t far behind on the bookies so it’s not impossible. She has done absolutely nothing but oppose housing developments.
44. Yeh I’m a Trump supporter. He’s said some stupid things but he loves his country and is great leader.
45. Nah mate. I said I’d prefer ALP over the Greens but always an LNP voter
46. If anything, we simply have to hope labor somehow wins as what the LNP is proposing is definitely not what we want in Queensland especially when they are going to undermine the future of our energy grid and basic health rights etc.
47. Meaghan to maintain Gaven. 🤞🤞🤞
48. No. I'm expecting a razor thin LNP victory. > A uniform swing of 3.1% would cost Labor five seats and reduce the party to a minority position. The LNP need 12 seats for majority government which requires a uniform swing of 5.6%. A swing between those figures would leave no one party with control of the Legislative Assembly. https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/qld/2024/guide/preview
49. Personally, a very slim LNP majority is the most likely option in my mind. It seems logical to me that Labor is going to be completely wiped out everywhere north of Hervey Bay, and likewise the LNP is going to struggle to snipe seats from Labor in Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast, given their abysmal performance these last two weeks. I'm not expecting any change from the Gold Coast or anywhere west of the Lockyer. The election is going to be decided in Brisbane's outer suburbs and the string of cities up North. I *hope* for a razor thin miracle in Labor taking minority government, but I don't see it being particularly likely.
50. My predictions based on nothing but my own vibes is that LNP will make gains in the regions, Labor will do better in Brisbane, and Greens will increase their primary vote but not their number of seats. Predict LNP will win the most seats (even though I do not want this to happen) but unsure if it will be enough for a majority.
51. LNP minority. Labor will lose seats but some will go to Katter and one nation. LNP won't win enough seats from labor for a majority and labor will hold seats the greens are targeting.
52. I hope the greens/independants get more votes! and labor over liberal
53. Central Queensland ultimately decides which party forms the government depending on how they vote.
54. razor thin LNP majority, Greens might pick up a seat or 2, and Labor just loses some seats to pretty much everyone, but it won't be as bad for Labor compared to when Newman won (also expecting the LNP government will just end up being 1 term again because they won't do anything to actually alleviate inflation and housing, and that they will likely restrict abortion due to the Katter bill, and they will get blamed for that)
55. A part of me wants there to be a ALP/Greens coalition just to piss off the cookers. I don't care how effective it would be. I just want there to be cries of 'socialism' and 'tyranny'. And even better if they forced the Olympics to then make that disgusting bin chicken the Olympic mascot.
56. I generally think Labor have done nothing on the big issues (housing and zoning etc.), and last minute freebies leave a really bad taste in the mouth of anyone who doesn't immediately benefit from them. I'm predicting strong swing to liberals anywhere outside of 50c zone and for any demographic without state school age children. That should give it to LNP.
57. I think Labor will get smashed in North qld but hold on in Brisbane. Cairns will be interesting because it's always been Labor. The Katters will probably do well up north and maybe steal a seat or two off the LNP. Maybe 4 or 5 for Katter. One nation will get 1 seat max. I think the Greens will get 4 seats max but get close in a few others - there might be a few 3-way races with Labor winning those seats off greens preferences. As for the main race, I predict an LNP minority with Katter.
58. Well, you got two out of three correct.
59. why do you think the LNP is going to win? The polls are never true and they are seriously just Murdoch propaganda. labor may lose a handful of seats (6) but the greens and independents will probably snipe enough from the libs that any gain is muted. btw seats like noosa and maroochydore are probably the few places in the state where a libs -> greens flip is possible.
60. I'm genuinely astonished that people would vote for one of Newman's cabinet members. Once Crisafulli has been voted in we'll remember how Newman behaved.
61. She seems fairly popular and has a good profile. I think you're right.
62. why doesnt state labor just coalition with the greens and independents. it would literally save the state despite the very few almost redundant comprimises theyll have to make.
63. Better than the wipeout they were predicted to have at the start of the month.
64. Early voting was over a million so I think people had already made up their minds before abortion entered the discussion.
65. is it stat labor policy not to form coalition? honestly would rather that than liberals
66. to be honest even though I support labor using first preference to virtue signal is an absolute must while we have it (yikes).
67. Worst possible outcome. Mining Company proxies dragged further right by KAP and ON. I gav the lno my second preference (my highest ever) because of this
68. Yes but I'm disappointed to be right. Part of me thought it would be much closer.
69. Queensland follows a path of voting LNP after 3-4 terms of Labor, regretting it and going back to Labor.
70. Murdoch's media outlets are propaganda clinging to a few nuggets of credibility. They usually use the most reliable pollsters who trade on their fairness. Then, of course, Murdoch spins the results. In polls you really have to go on trends. Lab had shown a rapid improvement so I hold out hope for a minority lab govt
71. The polls have been right 7 out of 8 of the last elections, denying them is pure cope.
72. Bro newman ragged the idiot out, the libs having literally been riding on all of labor policies its astonishing and i am legit concerned that somehow people can see.!!!
73. Really hoping she holds on. Has there been any word on who will be the Labor Leader after the election? Depending on how many seats Labor hold would be good if Miles gets another crack. I just don’t know how he would go as an opposition leader.
74. Mining royalties. Greens don’t necessarily want more mining royalties, they want less mines. Also I don’t think they’d partner with Labor even if Labor wanted to.
75. Independents by virtue of the name, won't enter a formal coalition. There may be an agreement on supply, but, they won't follow the ALP line. The Greens won't ally with Labor as they want to replace Labor. They love sniping at us from the political left completely aware they're doing damage to the overall concept of progressive politics. Politically they've proven to be untrustworthy as they're more interested in destruction than governing. An example of this in the Federal sphere, Max Chandler-Mather voted against a housing bill because the Greens wanted a specific rider added to it that the ALP refused. Completely forgot bigger picture, all about negative politics. https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/people/representatives/griffith/max_chandler-mather/policies/117
76. abortion has been apart of the discussion the whole time. early voters knew.
77. its actually funny, because that may be the biggest deciding factors, state government benefits arent really convincing people which is strange but KAP may have nuked the libs and any possibility of passing any change by announcing it before the election
78. It's not policy, but they've previously indicated they wouldn't govern with the Greens, which all but rules out any minority government on their end.
79. It's actually a pretty normal result. Labor saved the furniture and cast doubt on the new premier's leadership skills. Amanda Stoker is running around and she's trouble. The Greens are clearly disconnected from reality, ten seats some said, their supporters are moving through the stages of grief, but they probably need to move on from denial and anger. They'll lose even more oxygen now the LNP is in power.
80. Miles has support from some unions. It might come down to how badly they lose. He's done well to claw back ground.
81. sadge
82. it’s pretty unfortunate because king smiles is definitely left enough to make awesome progress with the greens if only both sides would drop the beef. definitely gonna be sad to see him lose and i say that as a hardcore federal greens supporter
83. You're right. Katter announced intentions to recriminalise abortion on 8 October, before prepolls opened. I voted on 11 October and there was a line of people which usually signalls a change of government.
84. bruh, LNP or compromise with the greens and they choose the LNP for the rest of like WTF!!!
85. Both parties have said they won't do minority deals but I feel like they're going to have a change of heart when it becomes the only path to power
86. That's just Labor in a nutshell isn't it? They're a centre right party, on both the federal and state level they vote *far* more often with the LNP than anyone else. Two pro-landlord, pro-environmental destruction cheeks of the same ass, really. I've held my nose and voted for them this election, but only after preferencing the Greens and the legalized marijuana party ahead of them.
87. Thank god we have preference vote for this shit, I did something similar but i live in union heartland. wait till david cuts preferencing voting bruj
88. Qld labor should take a few notes from NSW labor on housing, who very recently passed a very pro tenant piece of legislation. Also going to point out that the LNP are even worse at the whole environmental destruction thing given what was said on their campaign trail
89. Thank you. I normally do early votes but I even tried wearing headphones and both major parties still tried to pester me with how-to-vote cards.
90. Long time gonna, first time postal voter this election, very easy process, no need to make an account, just the name and address I think, you number one to whatever, tear off the perforated edge and slip it in the envelope provided freepost. Chuck it in a big red box a few streets away, on your way past. You can't ask for much than that, no urges to punch a politician in the face mentally, no queue, no fine.
91. I early voted for the first time this year and was in and out in less than 60 seconds. Sad I missed out on my sausage but I fired up the BBQ today in recognition of election day
92. Yeah, I’ve been postal voting for years, way better to just have it sent to me.
93. Thanks very much for the link, it's appreciated.
94. My postal vote came so late, I couldn't use it. Thankful for the ote-polling options now so I was still able to vote!
95. I voted on Saturday at lunchtime. Was literally 1 other voter in the basketball court. No line. Was in and out within 2 minutes
96. Just go and vote early. We voted on Thursday - walked in, voted, and out in under five minutes.
97. You need to master your Resting Bitch Face. I'm a tiny shortie but I paste on the RBF, put on my 1000m stare, shoulders back and pretend I'm the tallest person there. I get looks but no one tries to stop me or put a card in my hand. I do the same with kiosk operators and charity muggers. It's only 9/10 I can get past the chuggers though.
98. I even get that they might ask once, but the fact that if you politely decline at the entrance you still get bombarded multiple times all the way to the door. Obviously if I am not holding anything I have already said no and know how I want to vote. Although I somehow managed to turn up at a super non-busy time, so there were multiple people standing around waiting to pounce and next to no other voters... eep.
99. I'm curious to know if there are laws about how far these people can attempt to engage. I deliberately and obviously steer clear and keep my distance but they don't relent or even make snide comments about you sometimes.
100. Postal votes are accepted up to two weeks after election day so long as they are posted before the election day This is the actual reason it takes a couple of weeks to declare close races. It’s not the speed of the count, it’s the legal requirement to wait for declaration votes such as postals to arrive.
101. Also votes from other polling booths from people out of area that need to get sent down, e.g people from Brisbane voting in a Townsville booth.
102. The problem is that in rural areas it's up dramatically. That's why the argument is pervasive among LNP circles in rural strongholds. Split it up by region and you see massive spikes since COVID for Far North and North West. Rural areas haven't recovered as well, so poverty and crime go hand in hand.
103. Yep and if the fool is elected,watch it grow like a weed in spring 🌱
104. Just watch how quickly the commercial right wing media drop this “youf crimeee” narrative once the LNP move in.
105. What about compared to 10 years when Labor first came in?
106. Is this youth offences that have a conviction?
107. Oh and is that the ACT and SA, our two most progressive electorates with the lowest rates! Might be something to this listening to those who validly study such things.
108. But this doesn’t fit the LNP and media narrative *screeches in Murdoch news*
109. Meanwhile ALP election material literally told us to 'cut' Crisafulli
110. Great win
111. Sounds like less crime been attended to by police.
112. My vision is a little colour-deficient, so that graph was hard to read, the colour choices were terrible. I shifted the colours and moved the labels to make it easier to read https://i.imgur.com/bJ5X6G9.jpg
113. Come Live in Townsville and tell me if youth crime is reducing
114. Bro fuck off with this city slicker stat. Come to Cairns and Townsville and these little cunts are getting away with everything.
115. If you notice in the last few weeks,, they changed the narrative from youth crime to crime
116. When I was growing up, I remember hearing that if I broke the law it was my parents who were going to be held responsible. Why aren't we doing that? Now I will say that some parents, despite doing their very best, still end up with shithead kids. But what we need to do is provide services that those parents can reach out to in order to intervene before things turn bad. If the parents reach out, and do everything they can to get the child help, then if the child still screws up we put them in age appropriate supervision. If the parents are neglectful, don't reach out and their children turn into criminals then the parents should be held partially responsible for those crimes. The LNP idea of "Adult Crime, Adult Time" has never worked anywhere. We need to find out what's gone wrong to allow these kids to get to where they have. Punishment at the end of where they end up isn't going to stop the crime from happening. We need early intervention and an onus on the parents to reach out for it. We also need to kill the racism behind this and acknowledge that if it seems to be coming from one particular racial community, maybe that community isn't getting the resources they need. Engage with them and ask them what could help!
117. Bro Crime per person is not a valid statisic. Even miles called david out during the debate. its a red herring
118. Its almost flat-lined over the last 6 years . Too little , too late .
119. Now show the data specific to regional areas. For example Townsville. [https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/townsville/queensland-crime-statistics/](https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/townsville/queensland-crime-statistics/) [https://redsuburbs.com.au/suburbs/townsville-city/](https://redsuburbs.com.au/suburbs/townsville-city/) It's especially more obvious when the crimes that are going up are crimes against property and person - Much more "in your face".
120. maybe in inner Brisbane sure but in rural areas mate youth crime is through the roof
121. How does this graph differentiate between stealing deodorant as opposed to having someone break into your house and steal your car?
122. Love a bit of Astroturfing. Just remember, it's an election not a revolution. So much angst in here. This sub is so not representative of the great state of Queensland at all.
123. I don’t really understand the argument here. Are we saying enough is being done about youth crime?
124. People don’t care about facts
