Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. It’s crazy to consider that if LNP retained Labor’s mining royalties, it could cover the estimated $5 billion needed for Olympic upgrades and still have surplus funds left over after just one year. Many people may not fully grasp the scale of revenue being lost and the significant improvements that could have been funded with that money. For context, in the 2021–2022 financial year, Queensland received approximately $7.3 billion in mining royalties. Retaining even a portion of these funds could have substantial implications for public infrastructure and services. But the qld voters have spoken, apparently half the state would rather all that money goes to a few fat ass billionaires instead. Fuck LNP and its crooks.
2. 1) Mining royalties will be cut. 2) Schoolies drug testing and 3 strike rule will be cut. 3) Criminalising abortion will be put to a conscience vote as either KAP or an LNP member bring it to table. 4) Due to 1), LNP will falsely claim that ALP has been recklessly overspending and putting QLD into significant debt that they have to unfortunately cut a few things. These will be, Education, healthcare, 50c fares, energy rebate, rego discount. My prediction of at least the next 12 months Edit: Conscience not Consensus
3. I was young when Newman was in but now I work for Queensland health, any healthcare workers around at the time who could fill me in on the impact to your job?
4. I have lived in North Queensland all my life. I have loved my life here and hold many cherished memories. Old Bob Katter has always been a loud, uneducated asshole, but his son has taken it to a whole new level. This extremist rhetoric, and the persistence of people in these parts to continue electing him despite this, has just about sealed my decision to leave my home of 35 years. I cannot tolerate the company of people who can listen to the kind of racist, bigoted, extremist nonsense he’s spewing and still find their way to vote for him over and over again.
5. At what point does Queensland go “hey maybe we should give up on the LNP and choose another opposition to Labor?” The few times they’ve gained power in QLD they’ve royally fucked everyone over. So why do they still get a chance every so often?
6. That's the problem though isn't it, angry voters are stupid voters. A delinquent 12 year old kid born into poverty and crime stole Debbie's car, so of course Debbie is going to vote for a party who base ALL of their policies on populism and ideology.. As long as children get thrown into adult prisons!!
7. I'm very concerned about public healthcare going forward. My partner and I have referrals we've already been waiting a long time on, we're both disabled. Currently doing a program at the hospital but every time I talk to the drs they say it's already pretty dismal in the system and I hate to think how many people's conditions will worsen because the already crumbling system crumbles further. All these LNP types would be quick to tell me I'm lazy for not working, but won't acknowledge that I can't work because It takes potentially years to access the fucking health system to get better.
8. Cristafulli seems pretty unpopular already . When he starts selling the state and doing shady shit , labor will waltz back in in 2028
9. The LNP used the exact same playbook that the US Republicans did in the 1960's and have used ever since. Protests are exactly what they want. They want people talking about abortion and people getting angry about it. They want to split the working class right down the middle and make it red vs blue just like America. They want that so no one will hold them to account on all the other horrible shit they're going to do. Like kids in privatised prisons. "In a democracy they don't tell us what to think, they tell us what to think about."
10. Rip my 50c fairs to work…oh and my basic human right to healthcare and autonomy over my body. Awesome, thanks Queensland.
11. There goes Arts Funding, Ownership over our vaginas, coal royalties, free ambulances, cheap public transport, the depressing list goes on. The LNP have never been a party for the average person & they’ve never believed in climate change. I certainly wouldn’t trust them.
12. I just spoke to someone who is a boomer and said “oh, everyone just wanted Steven out”. Shits me that people vote without any understanding on policy or party ethos. I said, well you just opened the door for Dutton to have more friends in high places. Reply: “oh we hate Dutton” I’m leaving the country if he gets to be PM. We will truly have lost our way.
13. For the lnp to have reached 47 seats a lot of women and young girls posting on tik tok about going to vote for them. I worry for Queenslanders as the Morrison gov created this economic crises. Most families struggling. The only relief was from the state as the fed stopped us from a recession that every other country has faced. Now the lnp will cease coal companies paying Queenslanders for our minerals, start cutting everything and blame the former gov. Rego up, taxes up, rates up, petrol prices will jump straight away with out the threat of a gov owned petrol station. Rail gone, cheap public transport. All measures to help will be gone. At least sky news will still make them feel good about them selves and blame the fed gov for their problems.
14. Goddam. I need to unplug from the news for a bit. It's so depressing. Who are these people that think this was in any way a good idea? Blows my mind.
15. Let’s see if there is going to be a real improvement to people outside the South East corner or whether or not they learned from last time. Personally I see a repeat of history because unfortunately the pollies are right about I thing: voters are stupid no matter which side their sit on.
16. As a Labor Party member, I can assure you, we are going to be absolutely merciless in holding the LNP to account over the next four years.
17. Qlder's can look forward to their tax $$ going to consultancy firms. Who will take over the role of the public service, which will be gutted. Its going to be horrible to watch religious views, take a front seat in QLD politics.
18. How the f*** do we live in a country where Queensland just voted to lock up little children instead of giving them free school lunch? Just wow
19. Queensland has just elected newman again. What a disaster.
20. You know what, bring on the anti-abortion vote. Let people find out what happens when they vote for a super dodgy corrupt morally regressive religious nutcase party into power. The people fucked around, and the people are gonna find out (fyi that I am pro abortion, but it seems stupid people are only learn through personal suffering)
21. A tale as old as time. >LNP: NOOooo No nOooOOoo mate, vote for us we won't do any of that. >Also LNP: Right, we're in? Fuck yes. All of that is now on the table. Heh, fuckin heh. Enjoy it while it lasts people, remember the psychic damage in four years when the next election rolls around.
22. I think a congratulations are in order. I would like to congratulate the News Corp media and 7 West Media for winning the election. Not that 2 oil men who have billions in shares in fossil fuels would want to sway the election. /s I look forward to no more abortions. Teenage mothers on the street with no where to live 8 year olds in an adult prison (that's going to work out well). Removing the gas royalties (So they get the gas for free again) And a state debt not in dollars borrowed but in stuff that needs to be done but isn't costing you all money. Higher energy bills over time (they love gas. You should buy more of their gas, actually you won't have a choice) Enjoy the new Toll road with its taxpayer funding but almost entirely Transurban owned. They will build it for certain. Housing defaults up Stuff being closed and shut down everywhere. The psychopaths are back in power. Well done!
23. Cristafullashiti
24. Yay my job just got a whole less secure
25. The difficulty with the issue is that we basically live in a dictatorship in Florida. What I mean by this is that the state is notionally conservative (55/45) as we can tell by the federal stranglehold on the state and becoming more conservative with people migrating north from NSW and Victoria and when you give a government that much power with no upper house and 4 year terms (where as discussed last night they can call on issues like preferential voting with less than 20 mins notice to vote) you are going to get outcomes that have not been properly debated and rushed through simply because they have the majority and there is no other check and balance. With the abortion issue Labor have done well enough anyway for it to survive a conscience vote and it was a reality check for KAP where it is likely to lose a seat not to overstep the mark because they have been pushed to the extremes of conservative politics with how they have been excised (rightly in my view) from the LNP
26. Sad to say that what I'm most upset about us is that we will lose our 50c fares in March. That $200 a month was pretty bloody handy. Other than that none of the parties are worth anything really.
27. Disabled endometriosis and fibromyalgia sufferer here. What if I have an ovarian cyst rupture, like I have in the past? I can't afford ambulance fees. There's a small chance I'll get sepsis and die. What if I had to go on the contraceptive pill to manage my endo symptoms? Is getting rid of that on the table, too? Merely speaking for me here. So many others have it so much worse. Wow, getting downvoted for sharing my legitimate fears. I hate this.
28. "Plan"?......You're telling me they have a plan?
29. Why was "Adult time for adult crimes" such a successful slogan when it genuinely just means "I want to send kids to prison"?
30. https://preview.redd.it/5hn0wvtnr8xd1.jpeg?width=2880&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=086b222e30708e6c3b0ad520ccfb362fca5e8804 ....what I saw...
31. Happens every so often. ALP gets complacent from being in power so long and people think a change will change that. Little do they know, in 3yrs time when QLD Gov services are at breaking point, they'll vote the ALP back in. Additionally I think the north has greatly affected the outcome. Maybe we should rethink the Japanese line.
32. A few years ago I chose to have a termination for medical reasons as my daughter had very complex and severe heart defects. A paediatric cardiologist wrote a really long list of what to expect if the pregnancy continued and my husband and I chose to suffer so that she would not have to. It was so, so hard to actually end my pregnancy at 18weeks... And that was with termination legal. No public hospital would touch me and an abortion clinic was not recommended to me for my mental and physical health. I can't imagine what women would go through to end a pregnancy for medical reasons if abortion becomes illegal.
33. there is a rally planned for 1st nov for abortion rights, by the national union of students https://preview.redd.it/nwluzp1f18xd1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=722385ff15624286de262bddb6b4d799a2a4029d
34. I thoroughly enjoy the fact that these dickheads talk tough on crime and in the end, nothing changes. Bunch of Muppets in NQ think this will solve breaking into your homes and stealing your shit. Nothing has ever changed there, it's been the SAME cycle for decades and the only thing that's changed has been a population increase a long with a substantial increase in cost of living. You had kids picking fights with adults, breaking into homes and stealing cars while growing up there. When my parents were kids, guess what? The same thing, THE SAME FUCKING THING! Everytime they get in power and I just have to laugh at the gullibility of your average human being. Not even just being gullible, having the people at 30 years old say "I don't vote, it's all stupid". We really, really, should NOT have mandatory voting, fml.
35. You cunts are going to be cooked. Lucky for me i was only living here for a year and get to fuck off back to my state in Jan. I cant believe how many people voted for the LNP when they offered up damn near no plan. It was the politics version of “here you go sir. Here is my ass hole for you to do as you please. Just don’t forget the lube”
36. Boomers like my father have royally screwed us over this time. I was stupid to think that labour had a chance, now we have to sit back and be at the whim of Campbell 2.0 and his lackeys. As I said on the children by choice AMA, we need to go big and hard if they come for the abortion laws. Like the French do. My theory for all of this isn't necessarily for religious beliefs, while they do pay a part, the government is sweating lately about our aging population. They want more cannon fodder for their stupid proxy wars and for the working class to keep propping the rich up. They're mad because they've created a world in which no one wants to raise children.
37. It's insane that a party with only 2% of votes, gets more seats than those parties with 7%, or 9%
38. I went on the sky news post on fb this morning, the boomers are so fkn happy. Makes me sick. They are ECSTATIC
39. I could be off the mark here but it wouldn't surprise me if it's not a top priority for Katter. Let's say he did it to shift the election (almost did) to cause a hung parliament then which party would hold the keys to government? Katter has a lot of legitimate gripes about the treatment of regional Qld, I could be way off but wouldn't be surprised if he used abortion as a way to gain more power. People in SEQ really don't understand how much regions get shafted. I'm sure Katter still holds those beliefs on abortion though but I can't see it being a priority for him.
40. When did Katter backtrack? He gave a round about answer yesterday that all but confirmed he plans a vote.
41. So what is this LNP pelicans actually plan for QLD ?
42. It’s funny how after watching the results on tv, everyone says to one another “well I didn’t vote for them” “neither did I”. Is there data available on what demographic actually voted for LNP
43. Why stop at controlling woman's bodies? If we pass a law that make abortion illegal, then we should step a little bit further. Let men have the ability to opt out of fatherhood. Like if we are turning the screws of oppression then let's really fuck them over by taking away their support systems.
44. Such a shame as the Katter party have been awesome for North QLD. Representing issues that matter to us. Unfortuantely they’ve decided to back this anti-abortion stance which a lot of us don’t support. You’ll find a lot of people still voted that way anyway due to their other policy’s etc.
45. There's a protest/rally thing at George square 6pm on Friday, I saw a poster on Instagram, DM me if you want me to send it through
46. As a NSWelshman, I haven't followed the Queensland campaign closer. I was watching the coverage of the results on Sky News last night and was completely clueless about what they were talking about when mentioning the abortion issue. Can someone explain to me what went on with that?
47. Keep it to a debate and don't be idiots about it difficulty=impossible
48. I'm honestly stunned and disappointed with this result, but I need to ask, if the LNP won by such a big margin, where are all the people going "Yippee, LNP won!"? Off watching Sky news I suppose.
49. This is rural QLDs fault and the fucking gold coast. Dumb uneducated hicks.
50. if I could move to WA I would, I feel ashamed to be a Queenslander.
51. Honestly it makes no difference in reality. The rich will get richer, the poorer will get poorer and the politicians will be more focussed on themselves and how much money THEY can get do themselves. The one concern I have is that my daughters will be betrayed by a state government about choice on abortion rights which is something they are both passionate about.
52. We're fucked https://preview.redd.it/gg0efcptt6xd1.jpeg?width=576&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3a64f043240b8f0e8bae82fcc0653e18f6f0228
53. The federal election is next May(?) so Crisafulli will be under strict orders from Dutton not to do anything stupid until then at least.
54. Strange how people are trying to talk this up as a nailbiter. 53 seats to 34 and a 2PP of 54-46 is a landslide win in any language.
55. Who gives a fuck about abortion, the LNP plan is to decrease the royalties on minerals and coal to zero, and lock it in with legislation for the next 100 years.
56. since 1989 the lnp have been in power only 5 years. they always screw it up.
57. Tbh I'm really tired and sleep isn't fixing it and I really just don't care about any of this anymore. $20 penalty fee thanks.
58. Friday 1st November, 6PM, King George Square there is a pro-choice rally. I will be there.
59. Will 50c fares stay?
60. They would have to be on crack to do: a) make abortion illegal (saying see ya to the female vote in 2028) b) do a Newman (saying see ya to everyone else in 2028) I can't see abortion being criminalised and I can see the Liberals learing from the 2012-2015 fiasco
61. Last time, LNP got voted in by a landslide. Mostly due to their campaign blaming ALP for the 2011 floods. Then, after the reckless damage Campbell Newman caused in such a short amount of time, they were voted out by a landslide. Shame we have to go through this whole process again.
62. I wonder what they’ll do about gay rights too. Labor made a lot of progress so there’s a lot of hate they can unleash there too.
63. Loving all these melts! Please keep them coming.
64. Enjoy the madness of the next four years. Every piece of shit small business involved in shifty shit knowing there will be nothing they can do wrong. Enjoy the crazy prices. Enjoy the fuck ups when they sack all the planners from government. Enjoy the weirdos who voted LNP crying in their beer when they see the fuck up they caused.
65. >Are there any rallies or protests that are being planned to make sure that it doesn't come up in parliament? What makes you think a rally or protest will pursuade a newly elected government that has just won a comfortable majority? The new government did not rule out a conscience vote on abortion legislation. The majority of Queenslanders, for better or worse, have backed the new government, including the government's stance on abortion legislation and conscience voting.
66. Abortion issue is the first time I want to get out and protest, and I’m a dude. Fuck the direction this country is headed
67. The majority of people are socially conservative. Even Lenin recognised this. Leftism is only popular when it's redistributing wealth to lower classes and improving their living standards. They aren't up for the socially progressive politics i.e abortion, immigration, diversity, sexual liberation ect. This stuff is only popular with upper middle class white people who live around cities and the handful of minorities who aspire to be them. If the left want to win they should at least pretend to want to improve the living standards of the majority of the working class. That means lowering living costs, reducing crime in working class areas and find a way for immigration not to look like you are actively replacing the working class that you are supposed to represent. Either that or they have to replace their current voting base with a new one.
68. I'm waiting with popcorn to see Fuckafoolie vs the Potato on nuclear power in Queensland.
69. I've been fuming all day and had been also thinking about posting here to see if anyones up for a protest /riot/ revolt!
70. Public support for abortion is over 65%, it wold be political suicide to back track laws yes there are pockets of majority religious types who are pro life, but that's healthy in a democratic society. Labor and greens shot themselves in the foot trying to make abortion an election issue when it was only a sound bite grab from the Katters who even thought we cared
71. “Now, if you’re asking me about, would I ever support recriminalising it, the answer is absolutely no … “Do you believe in a woman’s right to choose, yes or no?” he asked. “It probably won’t work for his TikTok, but yes,” Crisafulli responded. “There will be no changes to abortion laws if government changes in Queensland,” Crisafulli responded.
72. LNP, Give them a chance, you might find you're all better off! Respect QLD voters. They voted for change and if your side did not win oh well. Live life!
73. As someone who was thinking of moving to Brisbane (yes I know), the result of this vote after LNPs campaign has actually made me reconsider. I don't want to live in a state run by leaders who have such a dislike of their own constituents and worth a majority of people who support that view. Might go with Perth instead.
74. Rip I really enjoyed 50c buses, fairer coal royalties and reproductive rights while it lasted
75. Main focus from the conservative parties of QLD is to tighten the abortion laws not abolish them completely… QLD has some of the weakest abortion laws in the country, if not the whole world. Abortion is legal up until birth in QLD & there are no laws regarding babies born alive through failed late term abortions. The pro-life community are obviously outraged. After Steven miles changed the abortion legislation, he promised late term abortions would not rise & yet they doubled per year. Controversial aspects of the current abortion legislation that the conservative parties of QLD are focused on are: - Abortion permitted up until birth. - Failed late term abortions, where babies are born alive, have no medical rights & do not require medical care. - QLD having the highest rate of abortion pills prescribed, yet having a significantly lower population than NSW & VIC. - Gender selective abortions. I will note that I am a conservative, however, I support a woman’s right to access a termination of pregnancy in permitted & justified circumstances. But I think that QLD’s current laws are a little extreme at present.
76. It won't get through; Crisafulli almost lost an unloseable election because of it.
77. What's their plan again?
78. Little surprise? It’s been quite a big surprise for me given how similar the LNP and ALP policies were. I was expecting a much tighter election.
79. Can’t help feel like abortion laws in America and soon to be Aus has more to do with meeting replacement rates of citizens than anything else.
80. I voted for the cannabis party
81. Absolute media nonsense. Why anyone would look at America and think let’s take away abortion. LNP are two degrees right of labour. They’ll want more than one term.
82. The sooking here is hilarious. Welcome to the world outside your little left wing eco chamber
83. So, if the LNP have a clear majority, and abortion law is not on their agenda, they can literally shut down any bill the moment it is proposed. That’s how our state works. Stop running around saying the sky is falling. It’s not.
84. It seems odd many are complaining and acting things will get worse with not a day in power yet for LNP. Despite what gets said here - Brisbane currently ranks 2nd most expensive for rent, 2nd most expensive for utilities, most expensive for internet, most expensive for washing facilities, most expensive bar Canberra for a lunch out on work days, most expensive for milk and eggs and bread, most expensive for cars, amazingly most expensive for fuel (how???)… We are the 2nd most expensive place to live with the 5th highest salaries (close to 6th by a few dollars). All this with competitive advantages from agriculture and mining perspectives. Is it maybe a case of things are necessarily as rosie posie under current rule as some are making out to be?
85. Queenslander here and I'm all for separating from the mining areas above CQ. Suggest Queensland Gov keeps the cities approx 100 km inland along the east coast down to NSW. Let the basket cases have the resource sector and the rest of the State can concentrate on developing agriculture, primary industries, tourism, and boost manufacturing to replace the revenue. A big chunk of the State are absolute basket cases and the thought of those nutters with big hats telling women what to do with their ovaries enrages me. Bob Katter suggesting dangerous semi automatic guns be available will increase domestic violence expotentially. I believe if we can decrease domestic violence, then child violence will reduce, especially with help from the whole of the community such as neighbours and teachers willing to have a discreet word with parents of young, vulnerable kids at risk of being influenced by older siblings etc.
86. What a beautiful day today - Libs won and reddit is in full meltdown mode lmaooo
