Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. I work as a teacher in EQ and got an email this morning saying that there wouldn‚Äôt be layoffs for the public sector signed by Crisafulli. This was from his official email to my work email. It also said that he recognises that layoffs doesn‚Äôt help.
2. Crisafulli or however you spell it, announced yesterday morning that healthcare worker jobs are fine and that only upper management will be reorganised. However, middle management and C level employees need some cutting. People who do nothing but sign 1 document are pointless. I voted labour.
3. There has been a concerted campaign to radicalize everyone to motivate votes and energize political action. While I am not trying to invalidate legitimate feelings, just chill. Last week was the time to fight best you can and this week is the time to accept and reflect. There have always been political ebbs and flows, plenty of states have coalition governments and their government systems are fine. Focus on other things for a while and be ready for the next round of elections.
4. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúwhat it is‚Äù, this type of attitude and rhetoric needs to change.
5. Steven miles should of won the election
6. Idiot Queenslanders have successfully voted against themselves üò°
7. Welcome to democracy. It is what it is. Move on and move forward. It's not who I voted for, but it's the system we live in. And I prefer this system to any other.
8. Eell there has been a pledge of no job cuts and the 100 days look good https://online.lnp.org.au/first-one-hundred-days
9. Small point about energy. The bulk energy grid will take power from the cheapest source, which currently the renewable ones as they do not have the overheads of non-renewable. This process is highly automatic in terms of switching supply to maintain the grid so the downstream retail grids can operate. While the politicians love carrying on about it they hold no influence at all over this process. The only way they CAN influence it is to pile on a stupid amount of subsidies to that industry for the use of coal. There are currently 8 coal fire power plants as near as I know in Qld and none of them are scheduled for decommission until 2028 at the earliest (Callide) which is closest to Rockhampton. The decommissioning would be due to hitting it's safe operating lifecycle, just in time for the next election.
10. What‚Äôs with the ‚Äúguh, whatever, its over now‚Äù attitude in the comments? Do people not understand they can have political views, protest, organise, mail MPs, work towards a better future? Speak against the things they are against? The day is never done, where did fighting for whats right go?
11. The bigger question I have now is when and how did that piece of shit Health Minister become the states governor?
12. Try going for a walk
13. I am no LNP voter but I think being realistic about this, if a handful of well regulated mines in Queensland operating for 4 more years was going to make the climate worse... it was so far beyond saving that it wasn't going to make a difference shutting them down anyway. Besides all that, the biggest crime here is Australia, the nation over, does not tax corporations properly, and it doesn't matter if it's Lib or Lab in charge. All of our nations parliaments are run by resource companies and the average Australians are taxed to death to make up for it, with ever diminishing quality public services and infrastructure to show for it.
14. I def get your concern. To paraphrase Roger Hallam ( founder of Extinction Rebellion - agree with them or not) organising and fighting back is the best thing you can do - not just because without it you have no chance of winning but the act itself is good for your soul and mental health.
15. You got suckered in by labor propaganda.
16. The hysteria here is palpable.
17. [removed]
18. Respect the results, if labor did well, they wouldn't be out by the public votes. It's time for common sense to be back. The dark has gone, the storm has passed. We should all celebrate.
19. 'And the worry that they may control what happens to my kids own bodies' Just wondering did you give a fuck about the covid jab mandates?
20. Lol you stress about this? At 61 years old??
21. Just get over it, it‚Äôs the best new for Qld
22. This is complete gibberish.
23. Your kids or your grandkids bodies?
24. Nothing to worry about. Labor is composed of Lawyers and union grubs. Liberals are doctors and business people. You‚Äôre in safe hands now.
25. [removed]
26. Good reply mate. I do live in Joh country and there has never been a more rusted on bunch of Nat voters. Hospitals, airport, streets, all named in his and Flos honour. If they could vote for his corpse they would. I will definitely be one of the few trying to keep them accountable. Cheers.
27. On the surface these 100 day policies don't sound horrific. But I don't drink the Green cool-aid and im sure as hell not drinking the Blue cool-aid. I like to judge a party on what they actually do, rather than what they say. I'm very keen to see the true meaning behind these 100 day promises.
28. 22 isn‚Äôt anywhere near enough life experience to represent entire electorates
29. >A few interesting things to come out of this election: the new LNP MP for Pumicestone, Ariana, is 22 years old. I was still head down in a toilet bowl after too many goon bags at that age - imagine what kinds of things young people can do or the ideas they have, irrespective of the aligned party! If they are aligned with a party still considering the criminalisation of abortion, they are not bringing new ideas to the table.
30. I live in Pumucestone electorate, I can't believe a 22 year old won here. Literally what life experience does she have other than growing up wealthy? How is she going to get things done?? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Her advertising has been everywhere for months, you couldn't go anywhere without seeing her face so I guess I'm not surprised.
31. [removed]
32. Thank you mate. I'm 61 and am so worried about the country my kids will have to live in. Or maybe they will just leave.
33. It's interesting that there's been no blow back on the cancellation of the hydro project considering the noise that is blown from the LNP at the mere thought of going near mining under the guise of "losing jobs". I'm guessing job creation was never really the issue, now was it...
34. Both.
35. It benefits them, ergo, that's all they're interested in. Citizens deserve to allocate their own preferences. You know what, I would **love* to see "How to vote" cards made illegal on a State and Federal level. Now THAT, would give everyone the same starting point and end the day off political parties and the incessant bullshit deals they do in back rooms.
36. Actually Labor re-introduced it in 2016 to benefit themselves after it was scrapped in 1992 under the Goss Labor government. https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-21/compulsory-prefential-voting-returns-qld-parliament-passes-bill/7348172
37. It isn't just the redundancies, although those can be harsh. It is the fact that our health services are already limping along, and with less staff comes less quality service, more mistakes, more time to get care, and a reduction in health outcomes.
38. And don't forget. Jarrod, the law clerk who became AG will be involved.
39. How does that work if no one wants to take redundancy.. And where else are the jobs?
40. She didn't sign in laws that caused harm to certain groups of people tho. Jarrod Bleijie Signed anything Newman but in front of him. And caused so many unwarranted arrests and division.
41. Why would he do that? Newman was the man
42. conservatives core belief is "small government" so they cut any service they can and let private interests move in
43. Friends in private health insurance I guess. Make public health so unbearable people feel pressured to go private
44. Cutting health workers makes complete sense when the goal is to gut these essental services to make them unbarable to the general population to the point people are forced to move private and then they can run around saying "medicare doesnt work" then sell it off for parts to their buddies.
45. The Australian Right‚Äôs wet dream is cutting public health services to the point of making them obsolete and bringing in a US style healthcare system where if you can‚Äôt afford private insurance, you‚Äôre fucked non-consensually and without a condom.
46. You naturally think of front line health workers - nurses, doctors, orderlies, etc. but they're are also people in health that are in special projects or the bureaucrats who are decision makers. The LNP said something about putting doctors and nurses back in charge, so to meet that sounds like they'd target any 'extra fat' in the system first.
47. It‚Äôs just importing American election rhetoric, maybe this election was particularly annoying for coinciding with the U.S. one?
48. Political action is not bad nor should it be saved only for your mandatory voting. Things are changed from the ground up. Start with your community and local government to swing the state and federal.
49. Shoulda, woulda, coulda... But didn't. Time to refocus on what happened. Don't let the election being over, let you drop the ball on all those things you cared about deeply for 6 weeks.
50. Why? Queenslanders didn‚Äôt want him, and in a democracy, that is ALL that matters
51. Queensland tried LNP in 2012, and by the next election in 2015 realised what a huge fucking mistake that was and immediately voted them out again. I'm disappointed the electorate has forgotten..
52. True. I have accepted it. I said so. I was just voicing my concerns. Especially after living through the Joh era and the Newman years. It was not good.
53. What hysteria? Its just concern. After Joh and then Newman. Normal, law abiding citizens have a right to feel uneasy
54. You seem pleasant
55. Hahaha, this is the funniest thing I've read when the "leaders" dream job, according to his Daddy, was being a politician.
56. Business people? Probably not something I would cling to knowing the Premier's record on business.....
57. And paid $200000 to the company doing and audit on his business. But you get corruption with the lnp. It's built in
58. I honestly thought this was parody at first but wow, you're serious.
59. What kind of vile comment is this? If women can't get abortions, they die.
60. I bet you are one of the people who complain loudly about youth crime, without taking into consideration the vast majority of these crimes are committed by young people who have grown up in out of home care. You probably blame "the parents" without understanding they don't have any. Because that is what happens to kids who are born into a family who either doesn't want them or are not equipped to provide for them. I used to think people like you were pro life because you cared about kids, but now I'm not convinced. People who care about kids don't want them to grow up in care and then be locked up and institutionalised. So now I think you just like to punish women, poor people and indigenous people for existing.
61. Well said.
62. Counterpoint, parliament is full of old cunts with too much *outdated* life experience who don't really understand how the modern world works. Diversity of experiences in parliament is a good thing.
63. Could also say there are plenty of 30, 40, 50 and 60+ year olds with enough life experience that can barely make any meaningful progress in their electorates. Your opinion is fair but also late. She‚Äôs already been voted in.
64. Albanese went straight from uni into politics
65. Meaghan Scanlon was 24 when elected as the ALP member for Gaven In 2017. Presumably you‚Äôre ok with that?
66. How much life experience does Anthony Albanese have? He has literally been a political staffer or politician since the day he left university. He wouldn't have a clue about the average Aussie.
67. Well we could argue for anecdotal evidence all day; we just seem to have had opposite experiences so we can leave it at that. Unless you have a source? Reddit is an echo chamber for these sorts of things so it's natural that people will continue on obsessing over it for quite some time before it washes away. In fact - you have posted literally **hundreds** of comments regarding the QLD election in the past three days, so it makes me think whether **you** are the one that seems a little obsessive (in a lite version) regarding this election of which you had no control over as a non-voter. I caught the train to work today. Talked to my coworkers. Same shit still happening, my go card still charged me 50 cents. People who upvoted me here, including OP, can agree that a majority of the state have accepted the result and carried on. I've lived in Brisbane my whole life; and although I can only provide anecdotal experience, this is just the way Queenslanders are. Welcome by the way :)
68. I wasn't complaining. I was stating my view. And my concern. Having lived as a motorcycle rider and married to a Queensland Health worker when the LNP were last in government in Qld. The fear and the loss of freedom was not nice..
69. By the sounds of it, you're exactly the type of person we need to have a day and let vote here in Aus. Great comment. Election is over, move along Everyone, and get busy or get left behind.
70. Totally agree. And legislate truth in political advertising laws in all jurisdictions too.
71. It would mean Libs would probably win most elections.
72. Thank you for this info. I suppose both parties can be opportunists. I wish they wouldn't touch the electoral system except to make it more representative though. It doesn't feel very safe to be flirting with the US model.
73. I‚Äôm a nurse and today I did a shift which can only be described as a dumpster fire. As more and more work got thrown at me I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder how much worse it can get under new leadership, before those of us already at the end of our rope just decide to toss it in and change careers.
74. This is a reasonable concern. It's hard to believe health services could be less resourced without the system grinding to a halt.
75. 100% It is a 6 week wait to see a GP where I live.
76. As opposed to Anna P the law student who become premier for multiple terms?
77. It's about the severance package that comes with it. If you are close to retirement and you get offered a decent package that allows you to bail early, why wouldn't you? Anna Bligh instigated the Voluntary Separation Program before Newman got in, very lucrative deal if you had 10+ years of service. The catch was that if you applied for a VSP and were approved, your position disappeared as well. She was already trying to reduce the headcount. Newman's cuts were deep and wide but we'd already had a shit load of people and organisational knowledge walk out the door a year prior.
78. I don‚Äôt think there will be sweeping job cuts. They know this will be guaranteed to cost them the next election. Instead I could see temporary contracts not being extended and empty roles not being signed off to be filled, and requests for increases in funding for new roles being declined.
79. There are usually plenty of people who want to get out of government for a while. It only locks them out for a year. I took a voluntary redundancy when Newman got in and it allowed me to buy a house. I got basically twice my annual pay, but as a lump sum. I wouldn't t have been able to get the deposit if not for my beloved benefactor Newman.
80. If there‚Äôs too many people for the position, they‚Äôll spill the position. If you want your job back, you need to reapply for it and be successful in getting it. People who aren‚Äôt successful then can choose a redundancy or be reassigned somewhere else in government at level.
81. This! Americanisation of the health system. Same shit the tories were pulling in the UK. Gut the public system, whinge about it, then privatise and get cushy jobs in those sectors after being voted out after the damage is done. And in that mess, minimal staff will return public bc theyre now on higher private wages, paid for by everyone else
82. The condom is extra. $7000 after rebates
83. So more work for over worked Drs and nurses? Let's see how that pans out.
84. Almost 10 years of labor has destroyed this state. Moubtains of debt, youth crime off the charts, boondoggles like the olympics which dont bring in enough tourism for the cost, the mandates and fear they wroufht during the pandemic. They are staunchly anti-men and have helped support the federal government dismantling any fairness for men post divorce. Labor needed to go.
85. We certainly remember what a mistake voting labour in last election was‚Ä¶
86. Have you not seen the 90% of posts here?
87. His dad was a sugar farmer. He would have been greasing the PTO shafts on the tractors. He also knows how to start a 79 series cruiser. And listen to the engine with 350,000 purr like a kitten.
88. They give birth, hopefully.
89. True there was this famous mayor once... Ben Wyatt, was elected mayor at 18 and I think did a wonderful job
90. Yes the world should be run by teens. Ring Greta
91. I‚Äôm not upset. Or even against it. Politics, especially at that level, can be brutal tho
92. Did he go straight into an MP role tho? Genuine question, I don‚Äôt really care
93. Correct. I have posted hundreds of comments because I want everyone to *calm the fuck down*. So I have two questions for you: 1) How can I improve the place without communicating to people they need to calm down? *especially when they don‚Äôt know they are obsessive and how it looks to the general public.* 2) Please let me know of the kind of source you are looking for to prove the obsession? Perhaps this *exact* sub over the past few days‚Ä¶ but there‚Äôs no hard numbers here. So just the answer to those two questions would be great. That way we can really get to the crux of the problem.
94. Oh wow, you got hit **hard**. I was just explaining the motorcycle rider bullshit to my now adult kid and they were appalled and gobsmacked. Don't suppose you had *tattoos while riding* as well... You would have been extra fucked.
95. I wasn‚Äôt referring to your post. Originally I was referring to the first comment by Beautiful Factor.
96. Absolutely agree
97. As a nurse from NSW. If there's something to be learnt from us it is that, for whatever reason, nurses will put up with a lot of abuse and neglect from the government with minimal repercussions. Nurses in QLD have considerably better pay and conditions so I reckon the libs are licking their chops thinking about how much they can cut.
98. She didn't sign in laws that caused harm to certain groups of people tho. Jarrod Bleijie Signed anything Newman but in front of him. And caused so many unwarranted arrests and division.
99. Your insurance has denied the condom due to "pre-existing conditions" and now you're on the hook for $140k.
100. The murdoch and right-wing media won this election, and you are an example of how.
101. Does the polish make tbe boot taste better? Its been corporate sleeze all the way to the top for crissy. Bunch of the new MPs are cops bc LNP knows they vote in favour of sending kids to the slammers. Theyre not a party of comptent professionals
102. To their rapists babies? To the children they were not prepared for or did not want? What kind of life do you think those kids are going to have?
103. Yeah definitely not for the faint hearted. Hope she survives
104. "Following his graduation in 1984, Albanese began some five years of work as a research officer for the Labor politician who would become his mentor, Tom Uren, then minister for local government and administrative services, later deputy leader of the Labor Party. During this period Albanese also served (1985‚Äì87) as the president of Young Labor in New South Wales. From 1989 until 1995 he was the assistant general secretary of the state‚Äôs Labor Party, and from 1995 to 1996 he acted as a senior policy adviser for New South Wales Premier Bob Carr." Then was elected as an MP in 1996. He's never worked for a private company in his entire life. And despite talking up his "single mum in housing commission" upbringing often during the last election, He's now a multimillionaire having only been paid from the public purse his entire career.
105. Okay okay fair, let me try and answer those. And for one - I actually agree with you. I lived in regional Queensland for a year and spent a few in Mackay and Rockhampton too. The demographic are so far detached from the kinds of opinions you see in Brisbane. 1. Whilst it‚Äôs important to note that Reddit only encapsulates a very small population of the whole, wouldn‚Äôt it be also indicative to say that they only have a proportional amount of sway over the general public opinion? Like, who cares if Reddit is obsessive? Only the redditors themselves? And there‚Äôs no need to charge yourself with the responsibility of trying to make the subreddit better man. There‚Äôs absolutely no need. Just give it a bit of time. 2. Dunno man, was just having a jab at you‚Ä¶ In Brisbane at least, I have seen no one talk about politics or what happened over the weekend in public. Can‚Äôt be arsed for exact numbers either; maybe my yardstick for daily reddit use is not the same as another person‚Äôs? I don‚Äôt know. Apologise for that one. So the crux is; reddit is a really small subset of Brisbane‚Äôs population (regional Queensland even less probably) and there‚Äôs literally no need for you to do anything to try and improve the state of the subreddit. I reckon it‚Äôs just a waste of time, but that‚Äôs just me
106. People care about politics and there is more to public voice. It is not a ‚Äúwelp, whatever, sucks!‚Äù situation.
107. We are the best paid in Australia and we have very good working conditions. Say what will about us enduring shitty conditions and treatment but for me personally, I will happily move interstate if they fuck up my job. I love my work, I am worth the money, our union has worked hard to get us where we are. None of us has forgotten Campbell Newman and it was a sombre mood talking about the govt change at work this week.
108. Which unwarranted arrests are you referring to?
109. Damn if only I wasn‚Äôt born with a penis I wouldnt be hit by these damn fees!
110. For holding an incompetent and power hungry party accountable for their poor form in office?
111. Lives that fill their lungs with air? The baby didn't rape anyone. Just admit eugenics is your thing and be done with it.
112. Again, it‚Äôs anecdotal but one of the few eye opening points in moving here is how divisive and politically motivated Australians are. It‚Äôs not just Reddit, it‚Äôs the protests (that actually are quite nasty), it‚Äôs the political billboards all the time (not just election time), ‚ÄúMurdoch Media‚Äù always brought up in a political sense, the misinformation and twisting of the truth for political gain etc. (Note and it‚Äôs both sides). I know, I‚Äôm one person, and I do have that ‚ÄúI want to change the world‚Äù mentality when I never can however sometimes, it can help people.. especially when they don‚Äôt know it themselves. They may or may not want to know, but it is also about the due diligence of saying hey this is occurring, this is how it looks. Furthermore, Aus is a fantastic place, I love it here, but there are other things that are negatives. Let‚Äôs improve those areas. (Again, subjective but realistically it is just like anyone trying to achieve anything for a better outcome).
113. Yes and the public voice wanted the other guys. It‚Äôs literally democracy. Why should your voice count more than anyone else‚Äôs?
114. The second thing you said as an example is a complete fabrication by the media and LNP. Youth crime is continuing its downwards trend. Outside of certain areas, it's close to being the lowest ever recorded, iirc. In regards to the economy, they projected a surplus in 2026, and we are one of the top performing economies in the country. The anti-men stuff also seems like something straight out of sky news.
115. Out of all of your points, I want to focus on just one of them... Murdoch Media. Murdoch is literally a threat to democracy as has been proven time and time again. This isn't some bogeyman that people are having a mass hallucination over, this is very real and very serious and the more people that understood how dangerous he is to democracy, the better. Before his extreme influence (thank you John Howard for changing media ownership laws and driving the nail in the coffin of Australian journalism), our country had a very different political and social landscape and vernacular. I know this because I lived through it. Now, Murdoch has not only infiltrated politics, but society at large and all of this for the gains of the few who do the deals at the top.
