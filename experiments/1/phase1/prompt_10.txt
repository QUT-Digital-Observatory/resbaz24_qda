Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. "The only way Labor was able to recover some of its plummeting vote was by adopting our progressive policies - things like 50c fares, free school meals, free GP visits, a publicly owned energy retailer, and taxing mining corporations more fairly... With the LNP and conservative lobby groups already on the attack, Labor joined in, pouring all their resources into stopping the Greens in our target seats instead of fighting the LNP across the State. As a result, we now have an anti-choice, anti-renewables, conservative LNP government. Just a few weeks before the election, Steven Miles himself said he’d rather see an LNP government than work with the Greens. Some senior Labor figures are even celebrating last night’s result as a win, even though they’ve lost something like 20 seats. But just imagine what we could achieve if Labor had worked with the Greens instead of spending all their time and money fighting us?" I don't think it's a misrepresentation and definitely comes across as a complaint directly about Labor not working with them (despite the very same email outlining how they targeted Labor seats, lol). This was the post-election email he sent btw so just copied word for word.
2. That’s not at all what I’m saying but I can see how what I wrote could be interpreted that way if you huff paint
3. Come on yourself mate. Fact - they lost seats and the election Go ahead and tell me what you are disputing ______________________
4. Thus the political system is cooked and we will never elect a party with the values and policies we need. With that thinking pervading our system, we’ll forever be the cuck of the political establishment - only expecting what they’ve told us we’re allowed to expect and nothing more.
5. I’m just working within the semantic parameters that you gave me.
6. Here’s a couple of posts from Greens commenting on Labor’s adopting of Greens’ ideas. None are complaining, instead they’re claiming it as a win for the greater good.

8. I see - so you instead propose *what* - dictatorship of the revolutionary vanguard - instead of democratic reform that has seen the end of the property franchise, vote and equality extended to women and minorities, no fault divorce, extinguishment of bastardry, age+veterans+ disability pensions, minimum wage, welfare to students and working poor, socialised medicine and pharmaceuticals, a progressive tax system, paid maternity, subsidised childcare, free or subsided aged care, free education from kindy to year 12 and heavily subsidised thereafter, gay marriage, largely peaceful multiculturalism and 50c transport fares to be a failure? I’ll grant you housing and indigenous affairs are fails, and we need to keep working but Australia’s slow and steady blend of Labor fabianism and to be fair to the Liberal party, also liberal conservatism has delivered all this as a peaceful democratic system, while radical socialism and communism requires civil war, dictatorship to ignore the peoples will (too stupid to be trusted with the elections apparently) and turns to ashes in the mouth without ever seeming to deliver results. Screw that
9. Fuck I actually agree
10. No, I dont have the solutions but one things would be that mainstream media is stopped from continuing to hijack the imagination of voters. And we could also ban misinformation in political advertising. Ban corporate donations to political parties. Expand anti-corruption controls and increase mandatory transparency. Educate people on democracy, history, and other ways of doing government like we see in our european allies. We deserve a system where people vote for the policies they like, not just because they’ve been told 2 parties are the only viable options
11. They do it to track the usage. If a service is constantly over full and another is barely used they can optimise.
12. 0 Chance of that happening for minimum 4 years I would be more worried about LNP looking for excuses to scrap 50c fares despite promising to keep them
13. Something really useful and important that the token fare infrastructure does is provide data on public transport use. Knowing how many people are starting and finishing their journeys from which locations and when helps keep transport planning more efficient (and cost-effective) than if they didn't have that data. That's really important, and incredibly valuable both to planners and the public - a value worth paying to maintain the existing card/payment infrastructure, rather than replacing it with something more Orwellian like facial-recognition that tracks individuals from the start to finish of their journey. They should fuck off with the massive fare evasion fees, though.
14. You know what should be free! Toll roads once they’ve recouped the costs to build them
15. I'm grateful that they're 50c, I know the LNP committed to keep it but i'm doubtful they will.
16. Had a really pleasant experience on Friday, caught the train from Helensvale going up to Central. All seats were taken so my 68 yr old mum & I stood. 2 young girls straight away got up & offered their seats to us. It was just such a lovely gesture that you don’t often see anymore. They got off at Coomera so only stood for 6 minutes, but it was still lovely.
17. I'm not about to whinge about 50c.... anyway the new leaders will put an end to it soon enough... here come $50 fares....
18. Yes. TransLink system costs much more that it generates to maintain and there are significantly cheaper methods to track usage.
19. The 50c is there to track people. They need to know how many people are using services etc and if it was free people wouldn't tap on or tap off. They never said this, but I always suspected the initial 50c trial was more about having a stress test of the public transport system so they can make changed before the Olympics, as well as getting people back on public transport post covid. If we weren't having an election, it likely would have went away after 6 months (and still might).
20. Even if it isn’t solely to track people. 50c is insanely affordable. Plus some basic research is saying that there’s 300-500k trips a day. That’s huge amount of money to help maintain the equipment and pay wages that you otherwise wouldn’t get if you changed it to zero. Edit: 300k trips a day for a year at 50c is still 53 million a year in revenue.
21. No. It's used for statistical purposes. It's basically free
22. I wish people in the country had some free or 50c transport. It'll never happen.
23. The 50c bus is going to be in a significantly better condition than the free bus People have spent something of theirs even if it’s insignificant and now they are invested in it. If it was free it would be trashed so fast
24. The issue is by having a tokenistic fare as opposed to absolutely free you are still entering into a contract and a code of conduct that goes with that. If it was free it would be truly a free for all unless actual police presence was increased and there’s a million better things they could be doing to keep the community safe. You’d still need inspectors, and you still need a way to track usage patterns.
25. No! We are lucky to have 50c fares and hopefully that will continue, but that’s a small amount considering we want good drivers, maintained vehicles and safe routes. I’d be so happy if it continues at 50c, but if it were to go up to a maximum of $2 per trip, for longer trips for example, I’d very ok with that.
26. Yes, public transport should be free. Hence the term "public" transport.
27. Article that discusses what other cities have seen going from almost free to free. It has links to other articles discussing free public transport effects as well. https://www.inverse.com/culture/free-public-transportation-scientific-studies
28. It’s 50 cents so they can see data and figures of how many people are using it, what routes are popular and what times etc
29. Not having to scan a card would speed up embarking and disembarking, which would speed up the service. Studies show that people hate delays in public transport up to 4.5 times more than they hate delays in vehicle time. So you’d probably get a decent uptick in public transport use from anything that speeds up the process
30. It's a tracking mechanism. They could install better ones, but they already paid for this one recently so they need to get 10 years use out of the Pink Translink readers, to not have wasted money.
31. It keeps an eye on numbers and keeps people honest and less likely to destroy the network. There are debates on this issue if it works or not.
32. Yep well some people ruined that for us didn't they. I don't think labor would've made it free but they were definitely looking to keep the 50¢ fares
33. Why are people so against paying 50c. Here's some reasons for you. 1.People who fare evade are good targets for cops because they tend to also commit other crimes. 2. Valuable data of how many people use the service 3. You can already travel free in an emergency. My question is why are people hellbent for using the service for free?
34. Hurr durr socialism is bad! /s Seriously, though, free would be best.
35. Strongly agreed, there are other cheaper technologies that could be used to get enough data on how many travellers, when they got on/got off without all the financial systems also needing to be attached. This would increase the allowable margin for error, and vastly reduce any associated data remediation (financial systems must be corrected). Not to mention you could fire all those rentacop ticket inspectors. Prepare for the down votes tho, I've suggested this before and people don't like the idea for some reason...
36. Personally I'd have preferred for the fares to have remained at the original price and the money to be spent to increase access to public transport in more fringe areas.
37. Yes it should be free. A lot of people are saying they need go card data to track usage. If this is the case, couldnt u tap on and off and it not charge you or charge you 1 cent. A lot of larger cities have free transport and they seem to manage.
38. No - even a token value of 50c reinforces that the trip has value. Making it completely free removes that. It's more important than you think. Removing all out-of-pocket costs leads to a sense of complacency and entitlement. And remember, it's only 50c or free as long as mining royalties or some other public fund pays for it - any government can change that and return to the previous fare structure. Now, 50c on \*all\* translink routes could be re-visited - I don't expect 50c to take me all the way up the Qld coastline. Perhaps make it 50c from CBD centres out to dormitory suburbs, then $2 further out, and $5 further out. e.g. Moreton council to/from Brisbane - 50c. Sunshine Coast to Brisbane - $2 Bundaberg to Brisbane - $5 - with optional paid snacks or meals Cairns to Brisbane - $20 - of course, you have to consider meals and sleeping arrangements for that kind of distance. You can sleep in your seat or pay for a cabin. Plus a restaurant car. I wouldn't expect subsidised meals.
39. i think we need a generally better public transport system while keeping 50c and once we have that we could have free
40. yes.
41. Ideally it should be in such a way that it doesn’t compromise quality of travel and have room to extend the rail network further like for example to Toowoomba. 50c is quite cheap and while it is a great move. We must stop and think where the money is going to come from in this day and age when you cannot get a candy in 50c. The earlier fare was quite unreasonable as it was not really catering people who travel frequently on just certain days of the week. For example I just worked two days from the office while I needed to travel around a few times I was paying more or less $15 a day so $30 for two days? When ideally in a day I guess the kind of travelling I was doing a $8/$10 flat fare would have been reasonable. All I am saying is, I think it would be great to have a moderate approach and spend the money in extending the network to areas that lack trains and frequent public transport. Ipswich to Springfield is one top of my head but I’m sure there are many other examples. Besides some monthly pass system and cheaper fare on weekends could be also a great thing without straining the system. I hope 50c is not straining the system (:
42. I think so. Stations would be so much nicer if they didn't have ti be designed around gates, card readers, reloading stations etc.
43. While I do think they should be free, that's more because of the amount of bus drivers that get assaulted. Fair evasion should be allowed simply because we don't want to be putting bus drivers at risk. Does anyone know why they haven't turned on the new card readers because I just want to stop carrying my go card and I think that for tourists it would be a massive upgrade to not require them to invest in a gocard while in Brisbane
44. Yes. Encourage useable public transport.
45. Nah, shouldn’t be free, I personally think it should cost a minimal amount like 50cents, make people appreciate it more than having it for free.
46. That's been tried overseas and went badly as the services filled up with criminals harassing people with somewhere to go. Better to look at toll road fees for cars and light vehicles. That could reduce pollution and cost of living for many and speed up traffic for all.
47. I think they need to find a way to make Brisbane pay for its own public transport because they *will* cut regional services to save votes in Brisbane.
48. Yeah mate the rest of the state should pay for a select group of people to get to and from everywhere for free. Wake up to yourself.
49. Lmao
50. Nope, people treat stuff like shit when it’s free.
51. Free buses, free toll and free bridges. This should be the standard.
52. Whatever the fares are they need to crack on with rolling out contactless payments to buses. Recently needed to rely on public transport, it is a complete ballache trying to catch the bus only to realise they don't yet have contactless payments fitted and are now cashless (probably waved in during COVID and now here to stay). I don't have a go card as I haven't caught SEQ public transport in forever, and the only places to get one are newsagents (seriously?) or a train station. But to get to the station where they have gocard dispensing machines and contactless payments on gates you need a bus.
53. Yes, make everything free, we can fund it from the magical money tree.
54. If they made it free, all the people you mentioned who are getting a slice of the pie would be up in arms.
55. There has actually been studies from the US that enforcement of even very low fare evasion significantly reduces safety incidents on public transport.
56. Free is obviously preferable but how would it work? The buses and maintenance and rail and train aren’t free to build, run and maintain. You do need something to finance those and pay the people that drive the busses and trains. You could say it could be paid for completely by government but they need money to do that so what’s the replacement stream? Taxes. It wouldn’t truely be “free”. There should be measures on fare charging and I’d say that commercial companies that run public transport is a bad idea because it always ends in excessive fares and poor service and monopolies so a state funded system is the best one but I doubt it could ever work without a charge.
57. I'll care when Brisbane public transport is worth my time.
58. Sure it can be gotten rid of. But then some one will have to fund the replacement for the real time systems etc. better to just keep it and the fifty cent fares.
59. Free public transport, free electricity, tax free petrol and diesel, huge new subdivisions of cheap housing land blocks for the low income and entry level homes/cottages, the government to build sister jails or large scale extension to current jails for each region, government to build at least 3 or 4 multi story l studio , 1 and 2 bedroom apartments blocks housing developments in every major regional city with 5 year leases and fixed or means tested rent to combat housing crisis. Similar to what Americans call housing projects
60. Queensland and by extension Australia should make major investments in Public transport and HSR before free transport.
61. with how many taxes we pay why arnt we asking why snt it free or included in our taxes
62. No. Nothing is free and people need to know this, even by paying 0.5
63. Do disappointed the lnp didn’t promise to beat the 50c fares with a 49c fare
64. Actually I think it should be more, a chance it'll hang around. But still cheap like $1 for metro Brisbane, head out of the city it's $2 say to Goldie or sunny coast. Gympie from Brisbane? $5. Still way better than driving and parking and tolls. And if that's enough coin to fund it back to staff, tech, maintenance, upgrades, they won't boot it in 4 years and make it what stopped us using it. I'm thinking trains, but, buses relevant fees too as above.
65. No, besides the obvious need to track usage it's a security issue. If you don't need a ticket it limits the ability to move people along who aren't travelling. Fare evasion doesn't just give fines it enables police and ticketies to legally direct you to leave. You want juveniles, homeless people and drug addicts hanging around even more than they are? A ticket also covers insurance if something happens on the train. Like if it crashes or something.
66. This is Greens policy. The go-card system costs $300 million a year - contracted out to private companies. It makes no sense to keep it!
67. Half the people I see don’t tap on and off anyway
68. Yes, for residents. Even before the 50c fares came in, it was costing the state more to enforce tickets than they were recouping in fares. It doesn’t make much sense. Sure we could tap on for a free fare if it’s about tracking usage. Or drivers could track it with the same system they use to track fare evaders. The roll out of smart ticketing is costing tax-payers $371 million alone.
69. I believe that there is an economically rational argument for getting rid of fares. They only ever covered 10% of the costs here in QLD and getting rid of them all together would present savings. The argument for tracking usage is short sighted. There would have to be other ways of getting the same data. Even as someone not in the industry I can see that the sorts of things that track traffic movements like the sensors at stop lights and the roadside boxes that detect mobile phone signals could work. Heck I even remember bus drivers having clickers in the old days and I'm sure that sort of thing could now be digitised to also record the location. But even then, as a commuter it doesn't seem like they use that data to make adjustments particularly often.
70. Pretty sure they buses have to run and employees have to be paid somehow 🤔 if anything i would want it to be a dollar.but don't like how they phasing out the go card for credit card
71. No I think we should get a 50c deposit into our account every time we ride.
72. How can you track the data otherwise? That’s how we get a better public transport system. The 50c is free enough.
73. I saw a homeless guy get hit with a $322 fine for fare evasion on the bus. Felt sad for him. It would be nice if it were free.
74. 50c isn't sustainable. The reason mice die in traps is because they don't understand why the cheese is free.
75. Fuck it….just credit everyone $5 every journey they take. It’s only more debt 💸
76. Mining royalties should be shared around and fund things for all Australians, for example apply 50% discounts to multiple things.
77. It’s never free, taxpayers pay for the trains, track maintenance, drivers, rolling stock.. It might be free up front, but we pay for it our taxes
78. I still don’t understand why the state government is subsidising public transport for one part of the state and think this is even remotely sensible policy. Hey labour goons wonder why you got smashed in regional areas?
79. Let’s be honest, It was a vote buying endeavour for areas serviced by public transport and it worked, labor won the seats serviced by it and almost no other. Unpopular opinion but I think it should be funded by local government. If you live in an area serviced by public transport, then it should be funded by that local government. It’s not public transport if it’s not for all.
80. No. They need to determine passenger volumes.
81. They'll be gone within 3 months of Libs.
82. So what your saying put a heap of people out of work, pay them all the Dole, leave more office spaces empty. Government debt rises having to house these additional unemployed people who no longer have Health fund and are more reliant on the system.
83. Lovely idea but the council sure can't afford it. The state government is spending 32 million dollars a month to subsidise it now (possibly contributing to the regional bloodbath of Labor votes). That's money thats not available for school or hospitals (hence a dozen medical clinics in Brisbane that dont have funding to run full hours), and its money that comes from every QLD tax payer to service the needs of 6% of Brisbane commuters (not even 6% of voters - only 6 % of Brisbane commuters use public transport). Reducing the fare to 0.50 hasnt reduced the number of fare evaders and it hasnt got usage back to pre-covid levels. I would think asking state taxpayers to fund more Brisbane commuters is going too far..
84. Without the tap data they can’t plan to expand or change service frequency etc. That sort of data is essential. It would definitely save money getting rid of the system though.
85. Lnp aren’t known for being good with money - economy wise, I doubt they’ll have the ability to afford it for too much longer. They’ll prob be forced to sell transport off to private corporations.
86. It may as well - 50c isn't much. Interestingly enough fuel has been pretty cheap recently - probably because of the impending election of Trump and OPEC wanting to flood the market and/or drive down the price to convince voters to vote for Harris before Trump comes back in and ramps up US production to compete with OPEC so that is competing against taking public transport atm
87. I'd personally go for a model wherein it's free but you still need to get a ticket and can be fined for not.
88. Yes. 1. Data collection can be done via cameras, it doesn’t need to be incentivised by cards. 2. Wanting to criminalise fare evasion isn’t valid, sorry. Doesn’t matter if there’s a type of person more likely to commit a crime, that’s not only not a bus driver’s job to care about, it’s also a waste of everyone’s money to uphold subsidised cheap fares strictly to punish a few individuals. 3. Wanting to get rid of the homeless and never see them also isn’t valid. Try solving other societal issues first if you don’t want to see them.
89. Where the fuck is the money going to come from if you make it free ??????? People really need to think before they have stupid things to say...
90. It’s not free, someone has to pay for it.
