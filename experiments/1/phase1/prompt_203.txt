Your job is to analye a series of Reddit Comments are drawn from sbumissions related to the 2024 Queensland State Election. The comments are drawn from a collection of comments before, during and after the election itself on the 26th of October. The parties that sought election were the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Liberal National Party (LNP), the Queensland Greens (Greens), One Nation and Katter's Australian Party. The LNP prevailed in the election, with David Crisafulli becoming the new Premier of Queensland. 
We have identified several key issues that the major parties campaigned on during the 2024 Queensland State Election: Youth Crime (YC), Cost of Living (COL), Health (H), Energy and Infrastructure (EI), and Abortion Laws (AL). Below is a summary of each party's position on these issues:
Youth Crime (YC):
- LNP: Advocated for stricter penalties for young offenders, including the 'Adult Crime, Adult Time' policy, proposing that serious offenses committed by youths be met with adult sentencing. 
- Labor: Focused on rehabilitation and prevention programs, aiming to address the root causes of youth crime through community engagement and support services.

Cost of Living (COL):
- LNP: Proposed measures such as abolishing stamp duty on new builds for first home buyers and re-establishing the productivity commission to review building industry regulations, aiming to alleviate housing costs. 
- Labor: Introduced initiatives like 50-cent public transport fares, a $1,000 energy rebate, and free lunches for state primary school students to ease cost-of-living pressures.

Health (H):
- LNP: Committed $590 million to an 'Easier Access to Health Services Plan,' aiming to reduce ambulance ramping and hire additional healthcare workers. 
- Labor: Focused on maintaining and expanding healthcare services, addressing hospital capacity issues, and investing in new health infrastructure.

Energy and Infrastructure (EI):
- LNP: Criticized Labor's Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project as financially unviable and canceled it upon taking office, opting to explore smaller-scale hydro projects instead. 
- Labor: Proposed large-scale renewable energy projects, including the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, to transition towards 80% renewable energy by 2035.

Abortion Laws (AL):
- LNP: Stated there would be 'no changes' to abortion laws under their government, maintaining the status quo established in 2018. 
- Labor Party: Supported the existing abortion laws and opposed any attempts to repeal or amend them. Asserts that LNP intend to restrict access to abortion services based on the views of some of their members.

Analyze Reddit comments and code them based on the positions they support or oppose concerning these issues. You will output JSON, so valid values are strings or null. Use the following codes: YC, COL, H, EI, AL. If a comment's position is unclear or does not pertain to these issues, output null.

Secondly identify which party the comment appears to support. Use the party code ALP, LNP, Greens, ON, KAP if this can be determined, otherwise a null value if undetermined.

Output JSON as a list of objects where each object has an "id" (integer) property of the comment id, an "issue" property set to the issue code string (or null value), and a "party" property set to the party code string or null value. Null means JSON null, not a string. Values MUST be quoted, e.g. {"party": "LNP"} unless they are null, e.g. {"party": null}. Comments follow:

1. Because, like the Cannabis debate, they trot out the bullshit concept of “well it was different in my time”. No. Crime was crime. And some young people going slightly off the rails don’t need draconian jail sentences to graduate them to full qualified social terrorists, they are more in need of rehabilitation. Using the government to tackle the underlying issues that lead to juvenile delinquency (which Miles is actually doing by directly tackling cost of living issues) is by far the best use of tax payer resources.
2. 100%. I’d go higher, but sadly I tap out at full and total support.
3. Going on highly viewed social media and expressing your deep concern and fear is just as worthy. So many women are deeply scared by this but the violeny rhetoric expressed by people means protesting in public equals stigmatization, job losses and actual assault. So if you feel so deeply about going out and changing people's minds, why don't you?
4. Yes. Volunteer on booths. Get on socials. Have a chat. We have two days.
5. Nothing to change. People have their point of view. But LNP has no intention of changing any abortion or VAD laws. Relax. All is fine
6. The LNP has said that the LNP won't seek to introduce changes to the current las introduced by Labor. But Bob Katter has said he will introduce a private members Bill. This means that the Libs will vote to support that Bill.
7. Sounds very much like "I got mine, fuck you"
8. [deleted]
9. At what point? Legally, 22 weeks is the point of viable life. Before that, any complications are to a bundle of cells unable to function independently, sort of like how cancer doesn't exist without a host. The "record" for the earliest birth surviving to 1 year is 21 weeks, and that wasn't a good situation anyway. At what point do you extend suffering by continuing to prolong a life that would fail without intervention. At what point are you saying "God's will be damned, I'm going to force this body to keep pumping."
10. Correction. A potential life should it be able to develop to a point of self sufficient life.
11. Then why did he dodge the question 137 times before actually answering he was pro choice? Or when it went to a vote last time he voted against decriminalisation of abortion?
12. Mate you don’t get it. The LNP is expected to win in a landslide, which carries a strong likelihood that the internal makeup of the LNP caucus will change. The current moderate faction could easily become a minority amongst a bunch of evangelical and happyclapper types. And then just look at how hard the LNP are trying to explain it’s not in their plan. Not that they’ll prevent it, but it’s just not in their plan oh look a private member’s bill and a conscience vote. Boom. Law changed.
13. 100% true. Agree totally
14. Some facts can be scary.. would you care to explain why the liberal party had voted against abortion laws in that past and why it took over 132 times for DC to give an answer that wasn't dubious?
15. Conservatives in Australia have long followed the republican playbook. It’s not a scare campaign if it’s rooted in fact.
16. Relax? Not until Crisafulli states he would vote against any bills to change abortion laws and states he would not allow a conscience vote from his party. What he has said to date is meaningless to a women who does not want any changes to the current legislation
17. How much exactly did crissacunti give you for this?
18. Are you serious? The LNP will have to court the far right nutters if they win according to the projections and David Chrisa-fullofshit will say anything to win
19. And what will u do or say when this does happen? Will u also believe the bullshit emanating from the LNPs mouths even though u will clearly be able to see they passed it
20. Labor brought it up because the Katters mentioned they'd table a private member's bill and the majority of LNP MPs are anti abortion.
21. The scare campaign is working to some degree.
22. trans people don’t owe you surgery
23. The self-ID bill harms literally nobody and erases zero rights, but you're claiming that the possibility of an LNP conscience vote is just a scare campaign? Weird match of falling for an actual scare campaign while ignoring a very clear pathway to realistically losing abortion rights
24. Look at what happened recently in South Australia- that Bill was scary....sure, it didn't get through, but at 10-9 it was way too close.
25. I can’t believe I have to say this NO WOMAN gets an abortion late term because “she doesn’t want to be a mother”. There are some conditions that are not able to be discovered until late. A woman will choose to ensure her loved child is peaceful and without pain in a late abortion.
26. You know about the proposed bill that got voted on in South Australia? How can people be certain something similar won't happen in Qld? I have heard what Crisafulli has said, and none of it makes me sure that he won't allow for a conscience vote for his party.
27. Are... Are you trying to cover for [the guy who wouldn't answer the question about his stance on Women's reproductive rights over 132 times before he finally did](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/22/queensland-election-2024-lnp-abortion-policy-david-crisafulli)? Geez... I wonder why his "answer" didn't dispel concerns? In 2024 I guess people are less inclined to believe dodgy cunts like Crisafooli.
28. [Is that a core or non core promise](https://pmtranscripts.pmc.gov.au/release/transcript-10078)? In the words of his good mate, fool me once shame on you, fool me twice, can't get fooled again.

30. Look at the proposed bill that was put to vote in South Australia recently. At 10-9, that was very close. It is possible for changes to the abortion law to be put forward in Qld.
31. When dad can carry the child to term, deal with the permanent body changes, go through a painful medical procedure to birth it and volunteers to stay at home for a few months and raise it, then sure, he can have a say.
32. You're dreaming if you think they'll help with that
33. I don't see it as a scare campaign- look at the proposed bill that was recently voted on in South Australia. At 10-9, it was so close to getting through.
34. Katter and the LNP are the only ones importing culture war rubbish you blind fool. Crisafulli could've shut the whole thing down in a day by stating he wouldn't allow a conscience vote on the issue, but instead he chose to be incredibly dodgy and refused to answer the question every time it was put to him. This was an LNP own goal, not a scare campaign.
35. >Crisafulli has publicly stated he supports the right to choose and that there will be no changes to legislation. [Is that a core or non core promise](https://pmtranscripts.pmc.gov.au/release/transcript-10078)?
36. WTF does that have to do with the Qld election?
37. Says the random guy who loves blowing loads in women 🤷‍♀️
38. Incel
39. Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton. Two Liberals notoriously known for their tender love and care.
40. “You’re in safe hands with the Liberals” Their track record in Australia, state or Federal, would suggest the contrary
41. You should really check yourself for lead poisoning if you really think Liberals are caring people
42. Who plans a late term abortion?
43. If you're really a centrist, there's no way you would have ever voted for the LNP (or the National Party) in Queensland. Ever. They've never been anywhere near centrist.
44. [deleted]
45. I’m disgusted to learn that Crisafullofit has two daughters 🤮
46. It is though. It’s been confirmed the bill will be introduced. The parliament clerk doesn’t accept “well it’s not part of the plan” when it comes to a vote. The answer has to be yes or no
47. KAP have already said and pledged they are putting the bill forward, and that was very early on. It's been slipped a few times LNP are going to vote yes on it. Do ur research before u comment misinformation, especially about that shit. If u want more context look up Joanna howe and all he BS on the subject
48. Is that why Crisifulli dodged the question over a hundred times, voted against legalising it and is allowing his party full of anti-choice evangelicals a conscience vote? He says he has no plans to change it, but that's not a no. Just like how can-do-Campbell had no plans to sack 14,000 public servants.
49. Not sure if you're just dense or deliberately obtuse. It's not about it being on the LNPs agenda. It's if Crisafulli will give his party the opportunity to take away a woman's right to choose. Last year he unequivocally confirmed that he will "never ever" deny his members a conscience vote on women's reproductive rights. It's important to remember that 93% of his party including himself voted against decriminalising abortion in 2018.
50. Its absolutely on Katters agenda, which puts it on the table,
51. The issue is if katter brings a bill on a conscious vote, majority of lnp members would vote for abortion to be banned. So even if it's not their policy they can push it through
52. So do you have a source for this? KAP have confirmed they will introduce a bill to change abortion laws. The only answer to that is yes or no. Nothing else will be acceptable. How will the majority of potential politicians answer? We need to know how every single potential candidate will answer this question because they WILL HAVE TO ASWER IT IN PARLIAMENT WHEN THE VOTE HAPPENS.
53. I believe Crisafulli when he says they don’t have plans to change the laws. However the question is more about is about how his party would vote in the event if an independent introduced a bill to change the laws. The Katters are already talking about it LNP historically always have a conscious vote on this topic and Crisafulli is being very tight lipped about that. The only way the LNP can guarantee no changes is a promise for a non conscious vote and Crisafulli still hasn’t given a direct answer.
54. Labor don’t control journalists. Labor are not driving this one sister.
55. Ffs they will allow a conscience vote if Katter brings it to the table, which he has pledged to do. Then it will pass. Also what isn't a scare campaign is the budget that Crisafulli released this week with his plans to scrap coal mining royalties and cut 6.8mil from the public service and to privatise the ambulance service. If you're voting for the LNP you're either a billionaire or you hate yourself.
56. They have refused to answer media recently if they'll allow a conscience vote on abortion if somebody else tables a bill. Given that previously a conscience vote was allowed and 93% of candidates voted for abortion despite advice that it will cost them, they will absolutely be able to pass abortion bans if a conscience vote is allowed. We now know from an interview last year this is absolutely Crisafulli's intention.
57. Do you have your head in the sand or do you truly just not understand how any of this works?
58. you don't actually understand how our parliament works do you
59. True. Kinda funny to suffer from a taste of their own medicine though.
60. It means a lot to me as well, how can I call myself a part of our society if I don’t support half of our society?
61. The only thing I could suggest to not be so worried is to understand Australia is very heavily pro choice across basically all demographics Alot of people are just assuming nothing will change if the LNP win. If the worst case scenario happens it's going to utterly fuck them at the next election
62. The religious stacking of parties makes me sick
63. Idk I genuinely feel that QLD Labor are different to the federal party. Miles, Fentiman and Enoch are all from the left wing of the party and genuinely deeply invested in the social and cultural growth of the state. Miles is passionate and vocal about LGBTQ+ issues and women's rights, and has provided the first cost of living relief in years, the 50c public transport fares have genuinely made a difference for a LOT of people, and the school lunch program will help further still.
64. Diet Liberal is what Labor are, in my opinion
65. ACT would be silly to vote lnp. Aren’t like 60% of the place government “workers”
66. Governments have been changing laws and restricting people’s right to protest, and the police are notoriously unpleasant, aggressive & unfair towards protesters. None of that matters if they try and change reproductive healthcare rights though. That’s the line in the sand.
67. You're mistaking them with labor
68. Not physically dangerous, no, unless you go full riot. It’s the threat of arrest and/or losing your job that keeps most people from protesting.
69. Tiananmen
70. You are extremely wrong. Ex LNP member and held committee position. I’ve seen what lurks there.
71. This absolutely fits with what were voting against.
72. Not sure for that woman in particular but there are many reasons why. If a foetus dies in utero then usually a miscarriage occurs. Unfortunately for some that does not happen or it is incomplete (which means material is left behind) and an abortion is performed often called a d&c. Sometimes much wanted babies are not compatible with life and would die soon after birth and to save both the baby and mother the trauma of a live birth an abortion is performed. Sometimes carrying a baby to term would be detrimental to the mother’s health/life so an abortion is performed. I have a family member who found out on the same day that she was pregnant and had an aggressive form of cancer. She aborted in order to have chemo and radiation.
73. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/14/ireland-woman-dies-after-abortion-refusal This is why.
74. My Mama raised me right! Believe me... If the LNP happen to win, and if they try this shit, I'll be out on the street protesting. Not on my watch assholes.
75. In 2018 Crisafulli wanted to ban abortion in Queensland, he's now also [the guy who wouldn't answer the question about his stance on Women's reproductive rights over 132 times before he finally did](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/22/queensland-election-2024-lnp-abortion-policy-david-crisafulli). The LNP have, if you're an honest broker, been trying out the culture wars approach to Australian politics, which is being pulled right from the American Republican party's current playbook. Cozying up to billionaires (Dutton and Gina Reinhardt), which "coincidentally" the LNP plans to scrap mining taxes which pay for things like 50c bus fares and electricity bill rebates, and which could pay for so much more. Scomo started to bring the Evangelical Christian crowd into play when he was in, same as Perrotet was. Plenty in the LNP, even women, want to ban abortion and control women's bodily autonomy. Adrian Schrinner cut off the power at a park that desperate homeless people are living in... Instead of trying to help people, the LNP sees people less fortunate as not deserving a leg up. These are supposed to be the people making OUR country and OUR lives better, but they won't. Because they're all in it for themselves and their rich friends. . . . You do you mate. I'm not here to tell anyone what to do. It's a democracy and you have the absolute right to your vote. Just remember, who you vote for can make a huge difference one way or the other. This is Democracy Manifest!
76. The LNP are very sneakily skirting the key questions on this topic. They keep parroting the line about the ‘plan’. Crisafulli has been recorded dodging this question 39 times in a single interview. However: - Crisafulli and indeed most of the party all voted in 2018 for abortion to remain criminalised - Crisafulli stated in an interview at the end of last year that he specifically believes in allowing his party a conscience vote on this topic - some members of the LNP have been caught reassuring voters that are pro life Katter introducing a private members bill allows LNP members to vote along with their conscience. It doesn’t need to be part of the LNP plan.
77. Katter party said, if LNP is elected, they'd consider forcing a vote that could potentially make abortion a criminal activity again (it was de-criminalised in 2018). Crisafulli says it's not part of the plan, but LNP MPs would get a conscience vote, so can vote how they want, and some comments from LNP candidate appear pro changing the law back. Also, Crisafulli won't revel his personal position on how he would vote...? Labor said they won't change the law, they are pro a women's right to choose (they were the ones to decriminalise it in 2018). Just read Katter party are now walking back their initial comments and just want support for an abortion that's born alive...it got too crazy for me there, I tapped out. So basically people are afraid women's right to choose abortion will be taken away or changed. My nutshell version, someone else can prob give more details/insight (or start yelling at me that I got something wrong 😂)
78. The issue has come up again due to the Katter party promising to propose a bill to recriminalise abortion in Queensland. The LNP doesn't have an official stance on the issue, but when the bill to legalise abortion was passed back in 2018 all but three LNP members voted against its legalisation. Several LNP members have been caught on camera saying that they're "pro life", that they support the bill but can't say anything till after the election, etc. Crisafulli has dodged hundreds of questions about his stance on abortion, saying that it's "not part of their plan", and refuses to answer questions about whether he would allow his party a conscience vote on the Katter bill, in which case the LNP's stance on the issue is irrelevant as party members would vote according to their own individual beliefs which are overwhelmingly anti-abortion. Due to Labor seizing the bone that's been thrown them by Katter and the LNP, they've campaigned hard against the LNP on abortion in the past week or so, causing Katter to backtrack on some of the specifics of the bill. Crisafulli has said that LNP won't be making any changes to the existing laws, but Katter is still proposing the bill and Crisafulli still refuses to rule out a conscience vote (while he said he would allow last year).
79. Nothing. Abortion rights is becoming a last minute strawman.
80. All of Reddit. They can’t think for themselves, I genuinely wonder how some of them cope with real world issues 😂
81. They know that it won’t work. They also know a lot of voter’s brains can be short-circuited by fear, hate, and anger.
82. Yep, but alas, they are still allowed to lie in political advertising… the moment this is banned the moment lnp will have nothing…
83. are you fr?
84. What rights were taken away under the self-id Bill?
85. Agree to disagree there buddy.
86. as a nurse who did over 10 years in the private, I agree. Its a waste of money outside of faster elective surgery imo.
87. Three individual Lib members have refused to answer on i. Also with who they are going to preference if they win via minority that will be a condition.
88. What? Is basically everyone earning over $97k? Or a family income of $194k? Sign me the fuck up to be "basically everyone"
89. Joanna Howe is her name. She went nuts after it was voted down in SA and then she started the 'club'. But yea, she's a professor of law at the University of Adelaide and icr if she's the head of law as well or research? 🤔 1 of the 2.
90. The only thing I’m looking forward to when I go to vote, is giving a fucking earful to the LNP flogs lurking outside.
91. [removed]
92. No the LNP won’t be changing it, they’ll get Katter to raise and push the bill and the LNP members will vote to pass it, ergo not their fault. 🥰
93. tf are u doing under all these comments how about you go read up on whats actually going on instead 😭
94. Acc created 18 days ago Ur a bot🚨
95. Ooooooohhhh so you dislike Trans people. I get it now. Kindly remind me exactly what women's rights were removed by the self-id laws?
96. self-id isn’t going away, get fucked
97. Good on ya mate. We need a Townsville now!
98. \*Labor. This isn't the UK mate.
99. Sure bud, I bet all of the LNP candidates back that up. [https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/18/qld-election-2024-freya-ostapovitch-lnp-stretton-candidate-abortion-ntwnfb](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/18/qld-election-2024-freya-ostapovitch-lnp-stretton-candidate-abortion-ntwnfb)
100. No, they said they don't plan to change the laws. But they have not stated if they will rule out a conscience vote for that or not should another party introduce bills.
101. Mixed it up, but doesn't matter anyway. He was representing the Govt at the time.
102. LOL I don't watch/read/listen to trash media. All media that comes out of America is trash. The LNP will have a conscience vote on abortion. You can bet your life on that. Once the Party has that political cover. A media campaign will start. Nightly stories, articles in the newspapers. One member of the party, will bring forward a bill. Oh and look, we all in agreement. The conscience vote proves it. Then you'll have legislation before the House within a few months. With a vote by mid/late next year. If you don't see that coming. You need to learn how Australian politics works. This is the oldest trick in the book. David Crisafulli can stand in front of the cameras, saying no vote/change on abortion laws, until he's blue in the face. The Party decides policy not Crisafulli However, if he doesn't allow the conscience vote. David Crisafulli can and will be replaced as leader of QLD LNP. That's how our system works. He's not a President. If the party, behind close doors. Votes for someone else to be leader, he's out, gone. He won't risk being removed, by denying his party members a conscience vote on abortion.
103. You only have to watch Sky after dark for the same nonsensical drivel. All Australian content
104. No I will be voting Labor. Thanks anyway.
105. Sadly the only thing that changes these people minds is when the situation hits them in the face of their gilded silver spoon fed lives. And even then, they’ll only support it to the extent where it helps their very specific personal circumstance. Very much a situation of “I got mine, so fuck you and your poor arse pleb problems…”
106. I first had the conversation with them in 2008. I was 16 turning 17. I've been friends with them for a very long time. So it's not like I haven't given them enough time or chances or anything for them to change their mind. The interview they gave was sent to me by a friend and they asked me if I knew about this "change" or believed them. I was FURIOUS. They suddenly decide to run for state parliament and suddenly they're saying women should have the option. They never said that to my face. I don't know if they now know I was SA'ed but they DID know I had just gotten out of an bad relationship that was extremely awful and I hated and wanted to avoid my ex at every chance. It's not well known that I was SA'ed but it is very well known that the relationship was extremely abusive. So yeah. I respected my friends views at the time because everyone has different views. That was until that interview when they backflipped on everything and played nice guy. I saw them outside pre poll and I avoided them. I'm dreading seeing them tomorrow. I honestly hope they lose and my friend who is the current MP stays in.
107. Why is every super pro lnp account less than a month old?
108. Exactly. To much fumes from each side supporters. This election is disgusting. They are not focusing on showing what THEY are going to do but just throw shit to the opposite side..
109. Exactly
110. Don't get me wrong, im fine with it given the situation but 22 weeks
111. There are too many disable and elderly people that disprove that logic 😐
112. Because I suspect he personally is not in favour of abortions all the way up to term, which has nothing to do with the will of the people, and nothing to do with the commitments he's made as a result To paraphrase him "I'm looking forward to coming back here in 4 years and reminding you of this scare campaign" These are not the words of someone who is going to allow the law to change Everyone should vote ALP but this will go down as one of the most effective scare campaigns in state political history Edit: and quite frankly, if Crisafulli wins and the abortion laws don't change I look forward to reminding everyone of this as well On one hand I'm happy that it looks like it's mobilised the troops but on the other hand this has gotten absolutely mental. There is absolutely nothing now that Crisafulli could say to convince most of you that the law won't change under his government, you are (amusingly) religious on the subject now yourself
