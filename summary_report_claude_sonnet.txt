I'll provide a comprehensive analysis of these results in the context of the Queensland state election outcome.

Key Findings:

1. Issue Salience on Reddit:
- Youth Crime (YC) dominated the discourse at 31.81% of issue-coded comments
- Abortion Laws (AL) was the second most discussed at 25.57%
- Cost of Living (COL) was third at 21.50%
- Energy/Infrastructure (EI) and Health (H) received relatively less attention

2. Reddit Demographic Skew:
- As expected for the platform, there was a clear Labor/progressive bias with ALP supporters representing 59.61% of party-aligned comments versus 34.23% for LNP
- The Greens had notable representation (4.17%) while minor conservative parties (KAP, ON) had minimal presence

3. Issue-Party Analysis:
The chi-square test (p=0.0001) indicates statistically significant differences in how issues were distributed between ALP and LNP supporters. The key findings here are:

- Youth Crime showed the strongest partisan divide:
  * Overrepresented among LNP supporters (34.49% vs overall 31.81%)
  * Underrepresented among ALP supporters (28.60%)
  * This +2.68% LNP skew suggests Youth Crime resonated strongly with conservative voters

- Abortion Laws showed opposite partisan lean:
  * Overrepresented among ALP supporters (+3.45% above average)
  * Underrepresented among LNP supporters (-1.47%)
  * This suggests Labor's attempt to make abortion access a key issue resonated more with their base than swinging voters

- Cost of Living showed interesting patterns:
  * Slightly overrepresented among ALP supporters (+2.44%)
  * Nearly neutral for LNP (-0.46%)
  * This suggests Labor's cost of living measures (transport fares, energy rebates, school lunches) may not have cut through to swing voters as intended

Interpretation in Context of LNP Victory:

1. The data suggests Youth Crime was the LNP's most effective issue. Despite Reddit's progressive skew, YC discussions showed the strongest pro-LNP bias, indicating this issue likely had even stronger resonance in the broader electorate. The LNP's "Adult Crime, Adult Time" policy appears to have effectively captured public concern.

2. Labor's emphasis on Abortion Laws, while energizing their base (as shown by the +3.45% ALP skew), may have diverted attention from bread-and-butter issues that typically decide elections. The high prominence of this issue in the Reddit discourse (25.57%) might reflect the platform's progressive bias rather than broader electoral sentiments.

3. Cost of Living, despite being a critical election issue, shows relatively modest partisan skew. This suggests Labor's concrete cost-of-living measures may not have been perceived as sufficiently addressing voters' concerns, allowing the LNP's alternative proposals to gain traction.

4. The relatively low salience of Health (7.03%) and Energy/Infrastructure (14.10%) suggests these traditional strengths for Labor did not dominate the narrative, potentially allowing the LNP to focus the campaign on their preferred issues, particularly Youth Crime.

This analysis suggests the LNP's victory was likely driven by:
1. Effective messaging on Youth Crime that resonated beyond their base
2. Labor's focus on issues like Abortion Laws that, while important to their base, may not have swayed swing voters
3. An ability to neutralize Labor's cost of living narrative despite specific policy offerings

The Reddit data, even with its progressive skew, captures these dynamics, particularly the strength of the Youth Crime issue for the LNP, which likely had even greater resonance in the broader Queensland electorate.
