=== Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.5 summary of results ===

1. Reddit Discussion Composition:
- Despite Reddit's typical urban/progressive skew, LNP-supporting comments dominated the discussion (61.41% vs 26.64% for ALP)
- This is particularly notable given the actual election result was closer (the LNP achieved a 6.8% swing to secure 51/93 seats)
- The Greens presence in discussions was relatively small (7.85%), with minor parties like KAP and ON having minimal representation

2. Key Issues Distribution:
- Youth Crime (YC) was the most discussed issue (28.88% of coded comments)
- Abortion Laws (AL) was the second most discussed (23.89%)
- Cost of Living (COL) was third (22.90%)
- Health was notably under-discussed (only 6.03%)

3. Party-Issue Associations:
The data shows clear issue ownership patterns:

LNP Strengths:
- Strong association with Youth Crime discussion (+1.37% above average)
- Very strong association with Abortion Laws (+7.89%)
- These align with their "tough on crime" campaign messaging

ALP Strengths:
- Dominated Cost of Living discussions (+17.40% above average)
- Slightly positive on Energy/Infrastructure (+2.46%)
- Slightly positive on Health (+0.52%)

What This Suggests About LNP Victory:
1. Issue Salience: The two most discussed issues (Youth Crime and Abortion Laws) showed strong LNP association, suggesting these issues helped drive their narrative
2. Volume Advantage: The LNP's dominance in Reddit discussions might reflect successful message penetration even in traditionally non-conservative spaces
3. Cost of Living Paradox: While the ALP dominated COL discussions (+17.40%), this traditional strength apparently didn't translate into electoral success
4. Narrative Control: The high volume of discussion around Youth Crime suggests the LNP successfully made this a central election issue, playing to their law-and-order messaging

The chi-square test result (p < 0.0001) confirms these party-issue associations are statistically significant, not random chance.

This data suggests the LNP's victory was helped by:
1. Successfully elevating Youth Crime as a major issue
2. Strong messaging around Abortion Laws
3. Possibly neutralizing ALP's traditional COL advantage
4. Achieving message penetration even in typically progressive spaces like Reddit

The fact that this pattern appears on Reddit, which typically skews progressive, suggests these messages had particular resonance in the broader electorate.
