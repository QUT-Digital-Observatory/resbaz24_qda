The dataset files are in parquet format, a fancy columnar format that's way better than CSV because parquet files strongly define the types of every column. Thankfully, Pandas can read parquet files directly into a DataFrame. Let's do that now. Also, see the `dataset_readme.md` file in the dataset directory for more information on the dataset."
